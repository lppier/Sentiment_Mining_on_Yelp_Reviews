5,"In my younger days when lunch choices consisted of Soho's wide range of eateries as opposed to today's regimented packed lunches, there was one spot that was a consistent favourite. Wong Kei. This evening after a long day at work followed by a lengthy meeting and beer, I decided to revisit my favourite old haunt. It's as good as ever. I ordered my standard:
- Ho fun with beef and scrambled egg
It is a dish that sums up my love for the restaurant; hearty, authentic, homestyle cooking that will fill you up on a budget with the finest of ingredients - simplicity. There is nothing fancy about a plate of wet noodles with a generous helping of tender beef and eggs. Its taste is mildly salty with a slight spring onion sweetness and there isn't much else to it. What you get however is a sense of warmth and comfort with every bite that few other places can offer at its price point. Wong Kei has long been infamous for its abrasive staff and unassuming environment (both things I have no problems with personally) but in dishes such as this, it provides care in the way it feeds you. It in some ways encapsulates the very Chinese way of expressing love without words and not many people appreciate that, or open themselves up to notice such things at places like this.
I will forever love this place and hope it stays forever. As a little pro tip, this has to be consumed eating in to make use of the plentiful chilli oil crucial to this dish and for that rarest of perks by today's standards: free tea.
Wong Kei, please don't change.",1
3,"After going through yelp and tripadvisor, I wanted to try a Chinese restaurant in London. This place was definitely very popular on tripadvisor and people describe this as good food but bad service. So that's what I think of authentic Chinese food - good food but lack of service is normal! 
So I decided to check out this place since we were in this area and I heard lots about it. The menu has lots of different choices and variety. We ordered the fu-king fried rice, malaysian noodles. The food came out and I wasn't amazed by it. It was your typical Chinese food. I am not really sure if I like it enough to come back though. Everyone seemed to really love this place and the food but the food doesn't live up to the hype.
So bleh. Just Chinese food.
Also, I was surprised we had shared tables. So if you have a small party, they might sit you with a shared table, I don't know how common it is in London? I see shared tables as a norm in Asia/China though but not usually that common in America.",-1
5,Ordered Sichuan Prawns and Singapore Rice Noodles. Both were amazing.  Cash Only establishment.,1
3,"Wong Kei is one of the many options you'll find in the heart of London's Chinatown. There are several floors, and someone will direct you to a table. 
Food: It's simple and straightforward. The roasts hanging in their window are done well - duck, BBQ pork, roast pork. I had the pork and century egg congee, with a side of roast park. Congee was full of meat and egg, and had the right amount of ginger. The roast pork was fresh, with a crispy skin, and the meat was tender and not dry. 
Service: Food comes out quickly, and you'll be left alone to enjoy it. Reasonably attentive if you need something. 
Cost: The two items with tea cost me £17.50. 
Overall: It isn't fancy, but it does offer some decent food at decent prices.",-1
1,"One of the worst experience in a restaurant in my life. Both the food and the service, we have one friend who just had an injury on her leg so we asked if we can eat at the ground floor to avoid climbing the stairs. The waiter rudely checked my friend's leg to see if I am lying, we almost left because of it. 
In the end my friend didn't want to ruin the mood so we still stay. Fortunately we sat at the ground floor as we asked but one of the guy in the counter gave us a disgust look. ( there were plenty of sits in the restaurant at the time we were really unsure why they make it so difficult) 
The food was as terrible as the service, the rice was cooked with just too much water, the rice stick together like a rice ball, we didn't finish the rice. The grilled duck I had was ok but not crispy at all if you are looking for authentic Cantonese cuisine. The waiter who helped us to order was nice though, but the food and the main service is horrible. Skip this place if you can.",-1
1,Worse restaurant I have been to. No service.Roast duck rice was full of fat.,-1
1,"The worst food experience while I was traveling in London. I would skip and look elsewhere if possible. 
Here are a few things to expect while you eat here:
1. The staff do not care about you. 
2. Everybody is expected to order one item even though you're not hungry or they just charge you at a random amount to make it up. 
3. Food is just alright.
4. I saw the staff legit yelled at customers for asking questions about the menu. 
5. The staff also swore at some nice elderly people. Wtf? What is wrong with them?
However if you're into a bowl of lukewarm wonton soup for roughly £6, this is your place. 
I made a bad decision for coming here. The staff should be fired.",-1
4,I stupidly ordered wrong but the nice guy on the phone gave me the noodles i wanted AND let me keep the wrong order. 8/10 will come again but very expensive in  comparison to other local Chinese takeaways,1
2,"Wong Kei is notorious amongst local Chinese for serving cheap traditional Chinese food fast with rash (i.e. rude service) in very simple (i.e. old and down-trodden) surroundings. The colours on dishes and tea sets may be worn, I have found lipstick on a cup before, hair on the plate of food, etc. 
Having grown up in London and been a frequent visitor of Chinatown I have known what to come to expect of Wong Kei, and that is not to expect much in terms of quality but you can be fed with speed and at low prices compared to all its competitors in Chinatown. 
Many locals can feel at ease eating here even on their own (unless you feel embarrassed to have anyone you know spot you eating here). It is basically cheap (and not so cheerful) but it does its job and has served a useful purpose in London's Chinatown for many decades.",-1
3,"Pretty standard chinese food. Was a little confusing being told where to go and where to get seated at first. I ordered a rice plate with barbecue meats (pork belly, pork), which should have been the fastest dish at my table, since the bbq meats are cold and just placed on top of the rice, but for some reason my plate was the last to reach the table by far. A good amount of meat and a good amount of sauce over rice for a standard dinner. Prices are pretty decent too, I think around 6 pounds for my plate. Cash only.",-1
4,"--- American tourist ----
Wong Kei is A very  typical old fashion Chinatown restaurant. Very old furniture, very working class, not trendy, not cool, ""you get the best value here"" attitude of service. BUT I highly recommend it!
1. Price is damn good for most chow fun, fried noodles and soup noodles. Cheaper than the United States Chinatown in NY and SF. For other dishes, prices are average NOT cheap.
2. Roast duck is very good but NOT as good as Four Seasons around the corner which still has the BEST duck in London!  Half duck with NO bone is 11.5 pounds at Wong compared to 14.5 pounds with NO bone at Four (number may be off slightly but conclusion is the same). If you want the best duck, go to FOUR.
3. The wonton soup at Wong is average. Soup is meaty, little salty and not clear, not very tasty. Good wonton soup should be clear and strong with seafood (shrimp) taste. Wonton itself is average average although each one has a big piece of shrimp! It could have some MSG in it and it will taste a lot better!
4. Beef stew flat noodle soup is not bad and it is very vinegary. This type of strew is not common in Cantonese style. 
5. Tea is FREE.
Bathroom is acceptable marginally. Service is ok, not great.
Bottom line, good authentic Cantonese noodles restaurant BUT with very affordable prices earns Wong Kei  ****.
CASH ONLY, BUDDY!",1
2,"I've tasted fantastic Chinese food and this place definitely is NOT fantastic Chinese food. 
We ordered beef ho fun noodle and wonton soup noodles and they were both subpar, according to my Hong Kong parents. The table next to us was eating Peking duck, and the duck looked like it had been hacked by an amateur. 
Service is where it gets bad. They looked mad when we asked for extra bowls and chopsticks. And, when we asked to ""add tea"", the waiter looked at us in disbelief and said ""add tea??"" He then took away our tea pot and didn't return it for the duration of our meal. 
What kind of Chinese restaurant is surprised that it's customers drink tea? Tea is like, all Chinese people drink. 
Finally, the servers got mad when we walked up to the counter to pay, as if they were afraid we were going to run. As we left, a server was arguing with a customer, who yelled that the server ""didn't know how to treat women."" The server just stood smugly at the door with his arms crossed and didn't let those customers in. We didn't get the whole deets but you get the point, service is terrible. 
To be honest, when I look back at this experience, it's so ridiculous it's funny.",-1
1,"This is probably the worst Chinese restaurant. The waitress is so rude. The service is really bad. What she wants is for customers to leave fast, which she makes it really clear to us. I know it is rush hour but she lets us share a table with a group of other customers. We did not enjoy our lunch there as the atmosphere is uneasy and awkward. 
As for the food, the sour soup is really really bad, slimy and disgusting and cold. If you want the real Chinese cuisine, do not come to this place as it is so not representative.",-1
1,"If there were a zero rating, this place would get it. We made a bad choice going here. We saw the young waitress become impatient, and shout at 4 older Asian women who were ordering their food and asking questions. Our food was okay only. We failed to notice the great little Viet restaurant across from Wong Kei where we had Pho the next day! Give this a miss, it's not worth it to spend any money here. I wonder at how such young women waitresses could be so angry and hate their jobs, perhaps they are not paid well and with their service they likely don't get tips!",-1
4,"Whenever I am feeling starving this is my go to place. Cheap and quick authentic Chinese food. Portion sizes are huge and it's perfect for large groups. 
Be prepared that if you go by yourself or with someone else that you get seated with other smaller groups. The menu is extensive and you really are spoilt for choice! Whatever you pick it's all delicious. 
My dishes of choice are always Singapore noodles, Pork chop and Aubergine on boiled rice, or Braised Brisket of beef on boiled rice. 
Free unlimited Chinese tea and quick service! Remember Cash Only.",1
1,"Walked into this restaurant on our honeymoon with my Chinese-Canadian husband at which time we were promptly seated upstairs with the rest of the non-Asian people (I am white Canadian) and were immediately and absolutely appalled at this racial segregation in 2017!! The floors stunk of chlorine going upstairs. Then we were seated at a ""shared table"" when there were plenty of smaller tables for 2 downstairs. There were also tables of 4 upstairs which I was told when we asked to be seated alone. We were on our honeymoon after all. We walked out, absolutely appalled by this service. This separation would never happen in a Canadian Chinatown. Disgusting - what way to turn away customers.  No matter how good the food, this is not ethically ok and clearly for appearances sake only. This restaurant should be ashamed of its behaviour.",-1
4,"Ok I can't fault this restaurant other than their too-hilarious-to-be-mad-at-them shoddy service. 
Luckily I was armed with the knowledge of very low expectations over the service and the expectation of being very disappointed, that I thought nothing would surprise me but boy, I so wasn't ready for this lol!  
When we first arrived I scanned the room and took in the working class Chinese man's cafe tables, and thought okay... not complaining. I'm only here for the food! and then I looked over at the gaggle of staff hanging around the bar and then one stuck two fingers at me lazily (basically indicating a table for two) and I said yes and then he waved us off in the direction of the stairs. He didn't escort us upstairs nor did he come to the front to greet us. It felt very self service, almost empowering :D 
We then helped ourselves to the best table of 4 after realising there weren't a table for 2 around but the waitress hurriedly ushered us to a 'table for two' which we later realised was a shared table with another two customers!!!?? I tried to protest but in vain as the waitress was having none of it. Honestly, the whole concept of customers are always right and you must prioritise customer's needs before anything else are completely foreign to these people. 
The other two customers were as surprised as we were but later whispered that at least we all got into the exclusive dining area normally reserved for Chinese folks and as a Chinese myself, I got my non asian friend a free pass to the exclusive club which had linen covered tables with comfy enough seats compared to the greasy cheap looking mish mash of tables and chairs downstairs.
We were so fortunate that our fellow neighbours were such cool peeps and abit like the shared benches in Wagamama, we were like 'can you pass the soya sauce please?' etc. I mean I totally would've shared their food too (if they'd let me). Totally. Love the fact that Wong Kei forces us to interact with complete strangers. Such a unique perk. Also they know the issues with London's first world problems in their lack of communication with one another and has set itself on a mission to break these barriers. ;-) So admirable!
Our neighbours even helpfully smacked down some annoying flies and wiped it off the table for us. :') The flies acted as a bonus decoration ;-) The authenticity in this restaurant to the Far East is so in tune. You want abit of China? Go to Wong Kei!!  
If a food restaurant other than your typical Mcdonald's and Burger King, offers a drive through speedy service then this is it! The whole service was comparable to a factory conveyer belt. Time is precious and every second counts despite the fact that the restaurant was half empty with ample amounts of unoccupied tables and chairs scattered across the floor. Compared to your typical Chinatown establishment, this one takes the prawn cracker! As soon as we were seated and handed our menus, a waitress hovered above waiting to take our order (like less than a minute after we sat down). When I asked her to come back in a few minutes, the look on her face was utter shock. Truly funny to see. Honestly our table was wicked. We interacted with our neighbours and made such jokes that the same waitress came back looking horrified with nose flaring, that we were enjoying ourselves lol. 
Now onto the food. This is what I came for. Prices have gone up ever so slightly since well, the last recorded menu prices online) but still remain ahead of competition in terms of value, portion and quality. We had hearty meals of won ton noodle soup which was laden with won ton dumplings that when I finally demolished those meat parcels, I was actually surprised to see noodles underneath it! For a fiver, it truly was the epitome of eastern comfort food like bangers and mash is to English folks. For the side, we opted for bean curd with chilli and salt. I would totally recommend it to anyone because once you try it, you can't stop! Might need some water at hand because they don't use that msg sparingly!! 
Service is quick. You're in and out of there like fast food. In fact so quick you needn't worry about time. What they lack in service they more than abundantly made up for in quality and quantity of food.
Question of whether you're genuinely welcomed sits in the balance. Service charge is optional (thank goodness!!) and the waitress counted the money at our table (quite insecurely) after hovering nearby for a while whilst we emptied coins from our purses lol! Not to forget that the tea is freeeeee!  
Coming here is an experience onto itself like a ghost ride in a theme park. You love to hate it. All in all, I'd definitely be coming back here in a rush!",1
1,"The worst restaurant I have ever been to in my life, I would give a 0 stars if I could. Service was appallingly rude and barely even acknowledged us, and the food wasn't much better. A few of the waiters even went out of their way to make our experience miserable once we complained. PLEASE DON'T BRING YOUR BUSINESS HERE.",-1
2,"I have a dear friend in London who recommended this place, as I walked in I thought this could be a big mistake but I took the plunge....OMG this was horrible .. Not for localvores aka organic eaters.... I fear I will regret this later!
My stomach went upside down with the tea, I knew I was in the wrong place for my tastes....cheap food and boy you can taste it.
I made it through the night, .. This place is well worth the experience, cheap Chinese.. Gotta  love it. The fried chicken is so salty and pressed dry like a salt dish bomb #195 ... The sweet n sour pork # 79 or 78 was boney like waitress said would be ... Quite tasty but pineapple was so canned, I knew if I did not stop I would not do well later. Would not trade the memory or experience for the world, total must do at least  once. Thanks Abigal....",-1
3,"Cash only.
Cheap Chinese food. They almost pride themselves about being rude.  Waiter looks at me and says, ""dap toi, share table!"" 
I was lucky enough to sit next to someone who's mentally unstable.....fun...entertaining. He was talking to himself the whole time!
I don't care. Craving cheap Chinese food... And yes, I'm sick of fine dining.
Had duck over rice. Blah. 3 stars only because I didn't get sick. £5.50 which is cheap, considering I've been having £40 meals all week.",-1
4,"Wong Kei used to be a go-to place for me when visiting London in my youth. It was a good place for a quick, reliable meal to start or end an evening in the pubs around Covent Garden and Leicester Square.
Visiting London again, I thought it would be good to renew my acquaintance with the place after what must be 15 years, particularly because I was traveling with a friend who grew up in Hong Kong - I was keen to get his take on the experience.
I am glad to say Wong Kei did not disappoint after all this time. Apart from the staff's fun uniform t-shirts, everything else was exactly as I remember it. The brisk, efficient service was as unfriendly as ever. The plastic bowls and flatware was as classy as ever. The seating arrangements were as communal as ever. But best of all, the food was as tasty and good value as ever. I was always a fan, and I still am.",1
5,"As soon as you walk in, they tell you to go upstairs!
This place was great. I was warned ahead of time that the service would be awful, but that wasn't really my experience at all.
The food was dirt cheap, tasted great, had huge portion sizes, and came quickly. The servers aren't necessarily super attentive or overwhelmingly chatty, but who cares? They brought my delicious and reasonably priced chinese food to me quickly. That's all I cared about. I would recommend this place and go again.
They only take cash, I didn't know this beforehand but there's an ATM/cash machine a block away so it wasn't a big deal to run and grab some cash money!",1
3,"This is your typical Chinatown restaurant, and if you're looking for that sort of vibe, this is perfect for you and your friends! I was asked to meet a few friends here from Hong Kong for dinner before we went to the theatre. They heard it was famous for their bad reputation so they wanted to try it. I personally do not understand why they came all the way from Hong Kong to the UK to have Chinese food, but there is neither here or there. 
Food: If there's food in front of me, I'll eat it! I completely forgot what we ordered, but my friend pouted and said they all looked the same: stir-fried bbq pork, stir-fried vegetables, stir-fried a whole bunch of stuff and deep-fried tofu with chillies. Whatever we ordered, it came quickly and that was a good thing for us because we were in a hurry.
Atmosphere: It has a typical Chinese cafe-style atmosphere: busy, tacky oriental art, and a slight layer of grease on the wall that comes with a dive like so. Where the chairs are from an 80's diner and the plastic cutlery and crockery has been used so much, their logo is wearing off. If you're looking for 5 star dinning, you've come to the wrong place. If you're looking for fast, cheap eats, look no further than this lovely dive full of oriental tourists getting upset that it's not up to par with their home cooking or Chinese students that miss home and did not want to have instant noodles tonight. 
Service: The service wasn't that bad. I do want to say, it was surprisingly good based on their bad reputation. We walked in, told them how many people and were seated accordingly. In typical Chinese fashion, sometimes you may need to wave them down to get some service, but I feel that is the norm for busy restaurants.",-1
3,"I first went to Wong Kei in 1984 back when it was in its peak ""HOW MANY YOU?  UPSTAIR."" mode and ate here at least once a week when I still lived in London. I've lived overseas for a good few years but always make a point to visit WK when I'm back in London. The dishes had no change over the years at all: a good thing. March 2017, my first trip back since 2010, and the taste is much the same but now you can't order off menu and the portions are smaller. Also, the mixed meat chow ho fun didn't have liver in, which while not everyone's favorite did make it tastier. I'll always come back but the incredibly solid consistency has gone; it was a good run...",-1
3,"UPSTAIRS! Yells the wait staff for a bunch of tourists who are apparently here for the insults and terrible service. Wong Kei reminds me of a place back in San Francisco where a very famous waiter (Edsel Ford Fung of Sam Wo Restaurant) would insult unsuspecting patrons for not tipping, spit in people's food, and slamming food on the table.
I figured with the curt treatment the place is a cheap, no frills, get in and GTFO kind of place the moment I stepped in. I didn't even need to read the Yelp reviews to know that I'm going here just for the food and not fancy table service. As soon as I enter, the waiter acknowledges me and tells me to share a table downstairs. Not even seconds later I'm asked if I know what I want. I politely asked for a menu and was given one instantly. That probably my first mistake. You should already know what you want. They run a very tight ship here and I was put on the spot like on the episode of Seinfeld where the Soup Nazi was scolding patrons for taking too long in the soup line and sent to the back for not following his rules. I settled on the roast duck noodle soup and it came faster than you can say, ""Long live the queen"". The food was delicious, the service was meh. The locals seem to come here a lot and don't mind. I really didn't mind since I've experience much worst service in the past. 
The prices here are so ridiculously cheap that you're getting a great deal. There is no service charge and VAT is already included. Cash only!",-1
2,Generous portion with below average's quality of food. Prices are very reasonable but don't expect to have good quality of food.,-1
5,"If you want fast, good quality, delicious Chinese food, Wong Kei's is the place in China Town for you!
Stick to something simple and it's delicious - I can highly recommend the half/quarter crispy aromatic duck with pancakes (delicious!), the salt and pepper (chilli) deep fried squid is delicious.
The noodle soup with beef brisket or pork is also really yummy, full of flavour and meat.
The portion sizes here are great and you certainly won't leave hungry.
You should definitely try and sit on the ground floor as it's more open and airy than the upstairs floors. I love it in here, and even though the staff aren't overly friendly, if you're polite and thankful to them, they are actually very friendly back! 
Definitely check out Wong Kei's, especially because of the delicious food and GREAT PRICES!!! Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!",1
2,"Since my last visit here, the Wong Kei has certainly not lost none any of its endearing charm. To be fair, there was a little less ""throw it at you"" on this ocassion but trying to engage in conversation with any of the staff proved to be a rather pointless task.
Anyway, food is just about ok, it could be my age but all the dishes seem to be merging into one another. 
Had it not have been for some ridiculous ""one way pedestrian"" crowd control system on Chinese New Year, we would probably have ventured further down Gerrard Street.",-1
3,"Looking for a rough and ready Chinese served at lightning speed at rock bottom prices? Hit up Wong Kei. 
Having gained a (somewhat deserved) reputation for its scornful staff slamming down your dishes, disappointingly, it wasn't the case this time. They were fine - not friendly exactly but civil. 
Although, we were smelling distance from the toilets. Oh, and one of our tea cups had a faint lipstick stain smeared on it. 
But, hang on a sec because there're some good points too. The food is tasty. And it's dead cheap. Like £5.50 for a huge plate of heartwarming crispy noodles, tender beef and crunchy pak choi.
For that price, I'd almost expect a bit of old lippy on the crockery. 
Give it a go, if you dare - an essential London experience.",-1
2,"We walked in the establishment and were directed upstairs. We were a party of four. Coming from the west, we wanted more of the traditional dishes we were used to. We ordered starters and the RUDE staff did not want to let us keep the menu to order entrees. We did not feel welcomed and were under the impression that they wanted us to get the f%^*+ out. ALL of the staff was rude. Very very difficult and did not want to try and meet our needs. 
However the food was very tasty and the Singapore noodles were great.
The stars are solely for the taste of the food. This restaurant could easily be a 5 star place if the staff would change their attitudes. 
Average priced. 
Very old fashioned decorations. 
Bathrooms were somewhat clean.",-1
3,Wonky's,-1
3,"Low price casual eatery with plates £5-8 and complimentary tea with equally cheap casual deco and free sullen service. Crispy fried noodles disappointing, soggy non-crispy noodles, weak gravy, fish balls flat compressed bland. Dry beef hor fun much better, tasty and fragrant though greasy. This dish just saved from otherwise lower rating.",-1
4,"Wong Kei used to be infamous for cheap, filling Chinese food and rude waiters who would scold you and it was all part of the fun. I used to go as a student a long time ago and so it's officially a London eating 'institution' in my book. For me, the brusqueness of the staff translates to efficiency which I would take any day over ineptitude and slowness which drives me mad.
It was the first time I've been back since the re-opening or new management or whatever happened. On this occasion I was dining solo (always a good spot for solo dining) and was immediately directed to one of the solo dining tables right in the entrance area. The waiter came straight over and asked me what I wanted. I kind of like that, taking me for a regular because if I did know, I would just say right away. I asked for a menu instead since it had been a while...
I ordered a wonton soup and singapore noodles. Pretty straightforward.
My order came quickly and I was surprised to see that the wonton soup was a large bowlful with plenty of wontons which were really good. Prawn and pork, freshly made with big chunks of prawn with a good ginger note. It made me think how good this was especially for the price around £3.50 vs the £11 bowls of ramen noodles that have sprung up everywhere (was never comfortable with paying £11 for a bowl of soup noodles).
Singapore noodles also didn't scrimp on the meat and shrimp and a good sized portion. A bit overly salty not helped by the salty soup but overall solid.
Complimentary tea.
So. If in the mood for a quick spot of Chinese in the centre of town and want to get served quickly with no hype and no queues then come here.
Great value and good food. Still love Wong Kei and the quality seemed better than before.",1
2,"When you wind your way up the stairs of Wong Kei, you'll realise that this sprawling plaza of a place is truly labyrinthian and equally the stuff of food based nightmares. 
The food as you may know, is not really Wong Kei's selling point, as much as it is a masochistic tourist attraction; the town's hottest perturbing immersive theatrical experience you'll ever go to or like surprise speed dating for sadists. 
Normally when entering a restaurant, a server will acknowledge your party and seat all three or two or four of you at an accommodating table. Here you'll be shoved into any seat anywhere, separated from your group like Nemo from his family and left to flounder and eat awkwardly in front of strangers, four flights away, up into an adjoining space in what seems like breaking into or being smuggled into an open-plan office block/ come restaurant floor next door to sit with said random people, whilst you're left to recount your steps and your experiences thus far. 
On being escorted away from my dining companions, I'd have lost my mates if I hadn't grabbed a discarded prawn cracker at a nearby table and left a Hansel and Gretel-like trail back to them. 
So, I ended up joining an adjoining end of table, table. On my own, within waving distance of one of my friends, but I had to muscle in on another couple who had been lucky enough to sit together. 
It took sometime to get a waiter's attention, but it didn't take long to realise that the couple I'd been proffered to give my services to as a third wheel and Capering Gooseberry, had not just been stuck for conversation, but were simply too frightened to ask for; water, a napkin or anything else you'd usually expect at a restaurant. 
Finally a waiter, dashed to my attention. 
""Drink?""
Just as I flicked my eyes down to the menu to enquire, he was off. Fed up by my too long split second hesitation. 
The food came quickly, in fact when it did arrive it almost hit the linen before the plates did. 
""Noodles"", my waiter announced. *Slam* ""Chilli Beef"" *Slam*. Down went the bowls, whilst before they hit the table, the broth defied gravity remaining in mid-air and began cooling from the gust of wind created from the clipped turn of my waiter's back again.
He'd gone! Thank Christ, but I'd still not ordered my drink. I saw a couple of my friends separated over on two other tables making perplexed gestures to me in nervous fits of laughter. I thought they were having a good time, but I was to discover their waitress did not linger, who's laconic tone implied she too could give even less of a rat's rear about my or their whining on about being thirsty. In the end she abandoned herself from their table for mine, offered me a drinks menu and rolled her eyes so hard I thought it'd affect the gravitational pull of the moon.  So I did the darnedest of things and ordered what was to be a flat sodding cola. 
Well, if you must hanker for Anglicised greasy run of the mill Chinese food, go here, go simply for the terrifying experience and GO ON, GET OMLETTE AND CHIPS I DARE YOU!",-1
4,"A true classic. Busy busy , authentic cooking. Great ambience, very much at the heart of a Chinatown experience. Have been here since 1987 at regular intervals.",1
3,"Like the other reviews have said, the workers are not exactly the most welcoming or helpful and at times rude. As a first-timer at Wong Kei who was a little overwhelmed at the many choices, a waiter came over after 2 minutes of seating us told us to stop wasting her time when we couldn't tell her what we wanted to order, even though the restaurant wasn't packed. But regardless, we were starving, and the food came quickly, was cheap but a good value for the huge portions, and tasted decent enough for poor college students in London. 
Restaurant is cash only!",-1
3,"** Cash Only ** 
This place is decent - large menu and food quality was pretty good.  Not the best Chinese food I've had, but also not the worst.  Service isn't that great (poor actually) as others have noted.  If you want a quick reasonably tasty meal, this place will fit the bill however.",-1
4,"This spot is always on my go to list whenever I visit London. You come here for the quick, cheap food and rude service and not much else. If you are visiting, definitely try this out for the experience.",1
2,"My god. I've never had such terrible beef hor fun in my life. The noodles were tasteless and greasy, just a huge disappointment. 
The sauce for the mapo tofu was starchy and boring, basically just seasoned with a load of salt or soy sauce. 
The roast duck rice was average as well. The meat wasn't terrible but it wasn't great.
And to be honest, it isn't that cheap as well. Oh well. Come here if you wish, though I really don't recommend it.",-1
4,"My husband and I stumbled upon this place by accident.  We were walking down Chinatown to find a quick bite to eat before going to the theater.  My husband asked a complete strangers if the restaurant was good. He said, this restaurant is known for it's rude service but the food is amazing. So hubby decided that this is where we would dine.  
Once insided, we were lead to the second floor and were seated with the couple we asked outside about this restaurant.  The male happened to be a local and his wife was was California.  This meal turned out great!!!  My husband has the wonton soup, I had the crab and corn.  For our main, my husband had crisply beef and I had the spicy aubergine. The service was quite good. We did meet several wait staff.  I thought they were playfully rude which I actually enjoyed.  
This was our first meal here in London.  We enjoyed the food, the service and our impromptu dinner dates.  A big PLUS was the theater (for Book Of Mormon) was just around the corner.",1
4,"I admit it, I go to Wong Kei... and I LIKE it!
So they closed and reopened, and some things have changed. The prices went up a little (not by that much), although the portions are the same, the staff got a little friendlier and service just a tad slower. But what's important remains the same. It's a place where you can get a plate of relatively good Chinese food quickly for not a lot of money. It's by no means the best food in the world but it is at a price that's cheaper that the rest. 
By all means go to the buffets in Chinatown, but unless you eat smart, you're losing out, the drink you have there will push you to the £10 mark... At Wong Kei, eat in, and your tea is free. I don't go for the really elaborate dishes, they specialise in the one plate meal in my opinion, rice or noodles with something on it. Larger plates are a pretty much a plate of the main, and you then order rice on the side, good for groups. I've only once ordered off of their Chef's specials list - udon with seafood and XO, and to my surprise I loved it, but it was expensive, so don't think I'd get it again. That and most of my colleagues didn't really appreciate it...
So stick to the basics, don't worry about sitting at the communal table (people, it's meant to zig zag so you're not sitting next to someone, please learn this! Talking to you Mr sweaty businessman who proceeded to elbow me for my meal and cluck that I was in his way - I was there first!). And enjoy the experience, yes the staff can be surley, but they're meant to be!",1
4,"Ever since hubs saw the menu and found out there was eel with black bean sauce on the menu he was sold. This was the first sit down restaurant that we headed to in London. 
We went here for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday evening and were seated on the basement (may be called the ground floor) and service was prompt and efficient. We ordered the eel, hot pot with tofu and Singapore style thick rice noodles. Hubs loved the eel since this is not something we have in the USA or at least in Michigan and ate all but two pieces. The tofu hot pot had fish tofu as well as the regular braised tofu. As is typical with everywhere but the US, the hot pot was smaller than what I was expecting but tasted on par with the average hot pot. Lastly, the Singapore thick noodles were pretty tasty, but I found the curry flavor be not as strong as it's done in the states. The flavor was still good and contained mini shrimps, BBQ pork, onions, and sprouts. 
Given the price of around 25£, it's a great place to grab a reasonably priced, some may even say cheap eat when you are looking for a Chinese fix in London.",1
5,"Okay first off, this place is awesome. You're might think that it's probably awesome because of the food. Wrong. Or that it's awesome because of the service. Nope. Or that it's nostalgia from child-hood days (You might be right). But overall no. It's pretty much the best place in Chinatown because of the no fuss (read: efficient) service, down and dirty, give the customer what they ordered and with complimentary tea. No service charge, but it does go appreciated so leave what you can.
What elevates it above most other place, is the chilli oil. Hands down the best chilli oil in all of chinatown. Nobody else does it. Nobody else has re-created it. I have literally eaten here and nearly eaten half a glassful of the stuff. I know that's probably not a badge to be proud of, but it is just that good and I probably wouldn't eat here as the food is nothing special without it. Cheap, but not special.
Recently however, they've started raising the prices a little and portions are quite variable. You used to always get a gigantic (how do I finish this) portion. But nowadays you could get that, or get something a little more manageable. This said, The price of the dish I always get, either the shredded chicken/pork fried noodles (always make sure you get crispy noodles) or the belly pork/bbq pork on hot rice have increased from £3.80 and £4.00 a decade ago to £4.80 and £5.00 today. Take into account inflation and this is probably a below inflation increase, you still get unlimited tea and the amazing chilli which haven't changed a bit.
If you're a wetherspoon snob however, and you know who you are, you absolutely won't like this place and this review won't convince you otherwise. For others that like to give new things and try and risk poor service/variable quality good, Wong Kei is great, you just have to understand how it all works. What appears rude service on your first visit is actually efficiency engineered over many decades. After all, if you're there on your own sitting at the front, why would they give you a menu?? You should already know what you want, and most people do!
PS. Like other budget chinatown places. Cash Only. They also do takeaway. I kid you not, sometimes you can get this from ordering to in your hand in less than 45 seconds. They give you a little container of chilli oil, but do it properly. Open up your chinese foil takeaway box and add more yourself.",1
4,"Apparently it's been a long time since the good old days of waiters telling you to piss off because there's a queue outside and being amusingly rude. Anyway, they're still reasonably priced (cash only, folks) and the food remains good. I wouldn't say it's a life changing culinary experience, but it usually delivers and I never had to send anything back. The trick is to order food from the back of the menu; basically lots of options of meat with rice or noodles. It's even cheaper and the portions are huge; you won't miss out for not ordering the ""posher"" sounding dishes on the first few pages.
I can't stand green/jasmine tea, but if that's your thing you'll get it for free to your heart's content. There are some communal round tables where you sit in close proximity with strangers; if that's not your thing keep in mind it's always a risk. :)
If you want a chatty and smiley staff this is not the place to go (as it happens with most chinese places where staff is usually tired and overworked anyway), but if you like quick and good chinese food in central London, do try. I love sitting there during off peak hours with my tablet and munch on rice and meat while I people watch. There are always some amusing customers around, and sometimes the interaction between them and the staff isn't so smooth. Ah, the good old Wong Kei will always be the good old Wong Kei. ;)",1
1,"Walked in randomly for dinner Because there was a decent number of people inside... Thinking this must be great food. 
I was abruptly rushed to seat w strangers - ""share table"" the guy said. So I sat down and ordered chicken drumstick w roast pork over rice. 
I ate a few bites and I'm like this sauce is gravy and it's totally not what I'm used to in real Chinatowns like NYC. Our sauce is more soy sauce w some oil and it's definitely more fragrant and tasteful. 
I barely touched my food. I arrived back to my apt and the food was not settling well in my stomach. I had thrown up. Afterwards I had a small snack or two and I felt better. 
I will not come back nor should you visit this restaurant",-1
4,"Authentic Chinese food. You know it's going to be good when the restaurant is full and the menu has squiggly characters (that I can't read) as well as English. I somehow decided that something different would be a representative choice and rather than stick with something I knew, like Singapore Noodles or King Prawns, I stepped (more like leaped) outside of my comfort zone and ordered the steamed eel in black bean sauce. I still shake my head because I have no idea what I was thinking. I know I like the eel sushi, so how different could it be?
I have no doubt that it was good, for being eel. It was served extremely hot and after a few minutes of waiting for it to cool down, I picked up a slice with the chopsticks. Do you eat the skin? Oh, there's bone in there too. It was messy. It was... interesting. It was... odd. Would I have it again? I think I can safely say I would have something else, though I would absolutely return to the Wong Kei. But I'll stick with what I know next time!
Service seemed decent. No one was rude or short with me. I wasn't rushed at all. My tea was refilled without prompting.",1
2,"Like others have said, the service is pretty awful but that's how it's supposed to be at an authentic Chinese restaurant, so that wasn't an issue. The food tasted okay and the prices were average. My only real problem with my experience was the stingy portion sizes of our dishes. I'm used to the whole mostly rice, very little meat thing that asian restaurants do, but the value at Wong Kei compared to what you can get elsewhere in London straight up bad. As a tourist from a small Canadian city with superior Chinese restaurants (in my humble opinion), I gotta say... Londoners deserve better and shouldn't have to pay ridiculously high prices for half decent service/food when it comes to Chinese.",-1
3,"Oh my goodness, the quality has gone down again.  After two months of  Vegan diet on weekdays and seafood diet at the weekends until our Easter on the 12th, we are back to eating meat.  I ordered my usual Cha Siu with Choi Sum, and the meat was thin and the portion of the meat was very small, it contained carrots and tinned straw mushroom as well; it used contain Cha Siu and Choi Sum only.  The quality of rice plunged; it just tasted like an ordinary long-grain rice and part of it was mushy.",-1
3,"I came here during a weeknight for a quick bite with a friend. It was completely packed by 8pm so we randomly sat with a bunch of people (typical in this place). 
I'm Cantonese myself so maybe I have high standards, but I was shocked to find out that they don't offer the classic ginger scallion oil sauce with their white chicken. So instead I ordered soy sauce chicken over rice, which was really good but not enough meat to go with the rice.",-1
3,"Pretty good, authentic enough Chinese food. I had the schezwan prawns. The food was just spicy enough without being overbearing. The prawns were cooked very well.  Might come back.",-1
4,"The place is simple: they serve very cheap, good tasting, filling meals. On this, Wong Kei never disappoints.",1
4,"Ah the legendary Wong Kei!
This place has been a firm favourite for myself and my friends for the past 6 years (possibly more!). The free green tea, people-watching opportunities and rock-bottom meal prices have incentivised us to return year after year, despite the occasional cheeky comment and disturbing rumours of the chiefs doing a circle spit into the dishes of punters they dislike (seriously wish I'd never been told that story!).
When times are good I order the Chicken with Cashew Nuts and a side of Egg-Fried Rice. When times are not so good I order the 3 Cold Barbecue Meats on Hot Rice. I have never not cleaned my plate. Myself and my best friend usually, in addition, order the Mixed Hors d'oeuvres. And proceed to argue over who gets that last succulent teaspoon of seaweed when the rest of the savoury treats are devoured. And we do this every. Goddamn. Time
The restaurant staff have certainly gotten a lot politer since 2014's change in management. Which many punters are sad about, given that Wong Kei's former reputation as a 'legendary' rude restaurant. Not me, however. The times I've been back since I've enjoyed more than ever. Customer service goes a long way with me.
My only big gripe with Wong Kei (and this is sadly perennial) is that I always seem to suffer from an upset stomach the rest of the night and the next day...",1
1,"NOT FOR WESTERNERS!!! Felt unwelcome. On New Years Day, the waiter wanted us to leave our stuff on the dirty floor. We said the floor is dirty. He told us to go eat elsewhere. Bad service. Horrible. Jan 1, 2016 at 17:00.",-1
1,The service was horrible and the food tasted awful. I had a horrible stomach ache after aswell. You should definitely avoid.,-1
2,"How bad can you go... Purely relying on cheap prices to fill seats in your restaurant?
With this as their business model, I will always have a soft spot for Wong Kei!
The first time that I ever came here, I was introduced to the place by a friend of my dad's when I was still in my teens. I really did not know what to expect. Upon returning with my best friend, he and I spent the evening completely perplexed as to what was going on around us, even though we were the customers and we were the ones who were placing the orders. We most definitely were not in control or command of what was happening to us! 
I seem to remember almost random dishes appearing with no explanation as to what they were. I also remember very well ordering portions of egg fried rice and the waiting staff slamming the bowl down and me repeatedly asking where the other portion of rice was. Each time I asked, the waiter immediately started walking away and shouted at me ""You got it!"" 
After grabbing a more senior member of staff, he finally explained that two portions is one bowl. Thanks for that!
So when I returned here very recently, I was wondering if they still had ""the same magic"" that they used to.
Well, to be brief. Prices have most definitely escalated compared to what they used to be here. However, you most definitely get great value for your money. I can most definitely eat & eat & eat. And.... The relatively few dishes that I did order really challenged my eating prowess. 
Service here is still fairly crazy. But I suppose, it is all about perspective. I personally feel that over the last few years service in London has gotten worse and worse. Get me started on this topic I will tell you that it is the fault of including service in the bills, but I'll back off that for now. So, comparatively Wong Kei is no longer the worst place in London to be served food!
And you know what, that sort of disappoints me.",-1
5,I have been coming here for 17 years! Sat 'upstairs downstairs' met some great strangers sitting in the same table with them. Most of the time we talk about how fantastic the food is here everytime! Highly recommend this place not for their unique service but for their excellent food!,1
5,Quite simply the best value for money Chinese in London's Chinatown. Superb quality.. Sorry Shell Crab starter is truly brilliant.,1
3,"Wong Kei was ... eh ... OK to me.  The food indeed was authentic Chinese food, but for a restaurant in Chinatown, I was expecting more.  On our recent short trip to the UK, our first day in London, we walked all over the place.  by 4 PM in the afternoon, we were starving, having only had small snacks up until that point.  We rushed to Chinatown and decided to give Wong Kei a try.
We ordered half a crispy duck, wonton soup, pork and preserved egg congee, and a beef hue fen (stir fried thick noodle with beef).  The duck was a bit over cooked, but still got good flavors.  It came with pancakes, shredded cucumber and scallion to make your own duck wrap.
The congee was a very big size.  I was thinking it would be just a small bowl.  It was decent.  The beef hue fen was my favorite out of everything we ordered.  It has that 'big wok' smokey taste and the beef was very tender.  Our least favorite was the wonton soup.  The soup and the wonton filling were both bland.  
The price was decent, the food was decent... so it was A-OK for me.",-1
4,BBQ pork on rice is still very good at this fast food chinese restaurant.  I love the vibrant atmosphere of Wong Kei and the smells.  Still good for cheap chinese food after all these years.  Not sure how long it has been there but I know it's a long time.,1
2,I wouldn't come back.. All the Asians are on the first floor and tourist are on the second. Honestly they are racist and the food is just alright,-1
5,Cheap good Chinese food! There's plenty of seating and yes the free tea is a great plus. Service is fast and all the waiters speak perfect English. You have to pay 50 pence for a takeaway box by the way. I got sweet and sour chicken over rice for £5.20 and it's a pretty good sized portion too. I would definitely come back and try their other cheap options!,1
4,Good basic food. SUPER cheap especially for a visiting American stressing about how bad the pound conversion is. Horrible service -- but when it that cheap does it matter? Awkward seating...,1
3,"This whole hype on social media in regards to Wong Kei closing and then opening with new management really got me wanting to go back to see if there has been any changes. 
Wong Kei has always been a place for a simple fix of food at a cheap price and a place I can get fresh ho fun stir-fried at a reasonable price. Hate it when people state 'ho fun' in the menu when in fact it's just dried rice noodles rehydrated. Portion sizes is always a plus too along with no service charge and free green tea. But I never expect good presentation of food, wok energy, particularly good service or a very positive memorable experience.
So it caught my attention when news coverage was saying that the new manager is trying to input better service. Whilst customers were worried about the change in portion sizes, cheap prices and taste in their favourite chilli oil. So on Saturday me and my friend decided to test this new 'Wong Kei' out with a few of the most popular dishes and see if Wong Kei has lost it's original values.
Although there has been a repaint, decor is still exactly the same, same off green/blue tables on the ground floor, plastic white plates with 'Wong Kei' printed on them. The only thing that looked any diffferent were the soy sauce that are now in Lee Kum Kee glass bottles. 
We were given the new menu where the dishes looked exactly the same however all dishes were hiked up by 0.20p-0.40p. This certainly gives room for other Chinese restaurants to top Wong Kei in offering the cheapest one dish plates. 
We started with the most popular Roast pork and pork belly on rice. Either we were very lucky on the occasion with the cut or the meat has improved in quality. I was quite impressed with how lean the roast pork was, succulent and well marinated. The generous slices of meat did have a good bounce to it with a generous portion of rice in the same sweet brown sauce I'm used to. Nothing had changed here, if anything it was better than a lot of times I have been. 
My friend was so happy to find the chilli oil had not change either, still fragrant with notes of garlic and flavoursome. A spoon of that onto the rice dish add that perfect kick needed to make it a good simple lunch fix.
My usual char kway teow went downhill sadly. It was still fresh ho fun but it lacked flavour and depth. It was not as spicy as it used to be and in fact it was more bland than it used to be. There was minimal egg to be seen and portion went down as well. I've heard most of the chefs have left since the new manager took over but no reason was given. That could explain the cooking changes. They must be using a different curry powder or paste to.
Crispy pork noodles had mix opinions. My friend was sad to find that the noodles had change and are a lot thinner. It didn't effect me as it just made things more lighter and crisper but some might like it with more bite. As a business perspective I can see these noodles being quicker to fry. This actually became my favourite dish of the three as I enjoyed the long shredded pork and the thinly chopped mix vegetables on top that created a good layered of texture. The sauce was seasoned perfectly for me and yes although greasy it was expected, nothing has changed there. 
Now I didn't feel service had change at all- not like it bothered me. But there was no major improvements. Still no smile or polite welcoming. Our waiter still quickly pointed to the back which some can consider rude and asked us to pick any table there. Our female waitress who delivered our food was nicer and answered the majority of our questions given but she seemed genuinely nice and not like she had particular training. 
Still quite intrigued if any other dishes have changed at Wong Kei especially the Wonton Noodle Soup. Still I somehow feel the old Wong Kei is lost and being the most 'cheap' and 'generous' portions in Chinatown is no more. But for it's roast meats, chilli oil and crispy noodles there is a reason for return.",-1
3,"An old favorite for London old timers from seventies. Not been here for 20 yrs but still here in Chinatown. No nonsense take it or leave it service without the frills. Just came from a walking tour of Downing St, Big Ben and St James Park changing of horse guard.  We had the roast meat rice £6, wanton noodles £6, mushrooms chicken rice hot pot £8 for small and fried rice noodles with egg sauce & beef £6. About £26 for 5 of us. There's a 15 mins wait for the rice hot pot. We forewarned every one on our table that service can be variable in tone. Not bad for a cold gloomy winter's day. Free hot tea but we opted for hot water.",-1
2,"Automatic ding for having an empty soap dispenser in an already unsanitary bathroom.
Otherwise, the food tastes like most authentic Chinese places: it tastes fine but nothing spectacular.
I came for dinner and ordered a soup, main pork dish, and some rice. Overall, it was decent. None of the dishes really stood out to me. They're merely meeting my expectations for Chinese food. My parents did say the steamed fish dish that they had was actually amazing though so that counts for something I suppose. 
I encountered inconsistently slow service here which isn't uncommon for Chinese places. I'm pretty sure the two tables next to me got their food before me despite showing up afterwards. However, being insulted at one is new to me. When I asked the waitress where my food was long after her estimates had passed, she said it's my fault that I'm so impatient because I'm from mainland China. Thanks for assuming that just because I'm a foreigner who can speak Chinese, I'm automatically from China. 
I was also hoping for a break from pricey pubs, but in the end, the total came out to about how much I'd spend at a pub so it wasn't as cheap as I had hoped. Also an itemized bill would be nice so I can be sure I'm not being ripped off.",-1
4,"Have been coming to Wong Kei for several years and have yet to be disappointed. Food is always plentiful in size and flavour. The duck pancakes in particular are exquisite. Personally I am not a fan of the free jasmine tea they serve, but that's just personal taste. 
The chilli oil provided on the table is also amazing - definitely the best in Chinatown. No other place comes close with their chilli oil. 
Service has gradually improved over the years, though still known for being rude, it is now more in a playful fashion, as if only done to keep up the reputation. I tend to find that you are treated nicer if you come alone and sit on the ground floor, and treated more as a burden if in a group.
Would be 5 stars if they accepted card - cash only can be a drag.",1
3,"Perfectly fine, decent Chinese food. Not spectacular, but we left happy.
This is noodle oriented shop, not dumpling centered. Most Chinese in the US are Szechuan and/or dumpling--even if they have no special dumpling skill: they serve the standard steamed dumplings.  I appreciated that Wong Kei sticks with what they do best: noodles.
We shared a beef with black bean sauce and a shredded chicken with fried noodles. Both were good. they did not bring any white rice for the bean sauce dish, which is odd when coming from the US--they brought it when we asked. And even though there were three of us they did not bring plates. 
Still, the food was good and we were satisfied--paying check was a little bit difficult.",-1
4,"Consistent. Consistent douche bag servers, consistent awkward seating arrangements with complete strangers, and consistently the cheapest yet fastest Chinese grub in London's Chinatown.
I got to hand it to WK, it's complete equal opportunity. You are not a special butterfly or some prefab diva. You are equally treated like an inhumanely kept dog, fed only the basic food for sustenance, while sat by some complete stranger that both you and him/her are making it like the other is some white elephant in the room. But you know what? This establishment only cares about two things: feeding you the fastest way possible and getting you out equally as fast so that the process can be repeated with the next human being(s). And that's why I still have love for this joint. 
WK hasn't let me down once. The bar is set (low).",1
5,"So cheap for what you get! You can get a decent meal for two for less than £30. Probably not the best place to go if you're after quality, attentive customer service but the menu is diverse and you're guaranteed to get tasty dishes that are great value for money. The noodle and rice dishes portions are huge so it's easy to over order but you can always ask for a doggy bag to takeaway!",1
2,"Not sure how this place gets so many 5 star reviews. It's pretty much quick & dirty Chinese food. I'm not saying this place is dirty (figure of speech), but its cleanliness is on par with a typical cheap Chinese restaurant.
I've had the Beef Flat Noodle and Slippery Egg & Beef Rice, which were average to below average. Quality was okay, service was pretty nonexistant; just go in, eat, and get out. I did feel slightly rushed here - though it might have been a more psychological thing for me than actual waiters trying to rush us out.
The servers seem to give bad service on purpose, but it's all in good fun - as if they're playing a part. They actually aren't rude and quite courteous. I remember one visit I was watching as a waiter kept his eye pinned on a little kid jumping around in a seat. The server mentioned to the family that it was dangerous for the kid (~3 years old) to be jumping on the seat like that, and that it could tip over - which the parents just ignored. The waiter had his eye on the kid whenever he wasn't serving someone else, and would occasionally jerk towards the kid/seat when the kid seemed to be losing his balance. Nice guy - though he told one of our party to get their own chopsticks when asked to get a set of chopsticks (which he did get).",-1
5,"Known as the fast food chinese in chinatown, 
The service is brisk and you get stuck on tables with complete strangers while we all tuck into our food, its like were back in asia again... its great ;)
The cheap eats, with  big portions... and taste is pretty authentic 
Average cost is £4-8 for a dish 
I ordered 
Ramen noodles with duck
3 meats with rice 
with free green tea",1
4,"Yeah!! My first UK review :)
Thanks yelpers for pointing this place out. Great place to grab a super cheap bite (I ordered the fish ball noodle soup and sauteed choi sum) - under 10 quid!
The service is actually quite friendly and definitely efficient. Not sure why everyone thinks they're rude...probably helps that I speak some cantonese :)
I have a feeling I'll be eating here a lot when I'm out of dinner companions.",1
5,"One of my favourite restaurants in London for sure! Everything I've had so far is great quality and amazing taste! They got absolutely everything
The rude staff is kind of their thing and you kind of just make it into a game to make the waiter smile ;)
Cheap, fun and Noodles need I say more?",1
3,"We came here with a group from work to experience China Town and a local company tradition. The service is what they are somewhat known for, but with a twist. They can be loud, short and bordering on rude while always having fun. Lots of above average Chinese food for the price.",-1
4,"Decent, authentic Chinese food for £4 - £5 per head. Could it get any better?
Yes. The service is amazing. Well, when I say amazing, I don't mean amazing in the way that you might be thinking. I mean amazing in that they're so blunt and rude that it becomes amazing in a quirky ""it's cool to be uncool"" kind of way.
For example the service goes something like this...
US: Walk in door
WAITRESS: ""Yes, wha you want?""
US: ""Table for 3 please""
WAITRESS: ""No, sit here"" (on someone else's table)
US: ""Sure, thank you?""
WAITRESS: ""Wha you eat?""
US: ""Can we see a menu""
WAITRESS: Rolls eyes and reluctantly gets us menu's
WAITRESS: ""Ready?"" (Before we've had a chance to open the menu's)
And it goes on like this. It's rude, but in a good way, it's part of the charm and the fun of it. It's no-nonsense and totally worth it for the quality of the food and low price.",1
4,Exactly what I expected based on the reviews overall. Good food but bad service. Very much enjoyed the pork belly hot pot dish.,1
3,"Only enter this place if you are okay to sit with strangers. We entered as a couple and were ushered upstairs and pushed over to a table of 6, which had two others sitting there. We awkwardly sat down and said a little hello to our neighbours opposite us, already eating their meal. After they had finished and left, they were replaced by two others. So our date turned out to be not so much a date. We had it good though on our table of 6 with only 4 people. Behind us were an older couple sat opposite two young Indian guys on a four seater table. It looked super cramped and awkward. At least we weren't single diners. The downstairs is reserved for single diners only. I don't know what's worse...being singled out because you're single or being forced to sit within perfect distance to be able to hear the couple opposite whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears whilst we devoured our food.
Onto the food...We had the deep fried salt and chilli squid which was actually amazing. Not greasy, lightly battered, great flavours. We also had a pork, chicken, duck and vegetable dish which has basically just pork with pak choi. Find duck or chicken and you were lucky. Good sauce though. 
Would we come back? No. Too many other places to try in Chinatown and this one did not stand out. Service was okay compared to what other diners have written. Complimentary tea was nice.",-1
4,Delicious food. You have to get the aromatic duck appetizer. Assorted meat with fried noodles was a tasty delight. Upstairs dining  is airy and spacious.,1
3,"This is an old school fast food Chinese restaurant the kind that used to line the streets of America's Chinatowns.  It is a tremendous bargain, and very reliable.  I am not a fan of the crispier duck dishes served in London.  I prefer the more succulent versions.  We had a shrimp cashew, a vegetable dish, and a pupu platrrer appetizer on the fixed menu.  I enjoyed the shrimp dish the most.  If you love no frills restaiurants this place will do!",-1
5,"It's my favourite place in London.  Don't be put off by the lack of ambience or the quick and abrupt nature of all the people working there.  It's incredibly fast, great food and huge portions at a wicked cheap price.
You can't go wrong, they've got everything you want from a Chinese restaurant and it's the best service I've had in a long time (honestly).",1
2,"The food was bad with the service to match.   I would stay away, as there are so many better restaurants around Chinatown.",-1
3,"I heard of this place through the 2010 Not For Tourists Guide for London and a bunch of London guidebooks, saying that it is one of their recommendations for inexpensive eating in London. I decided to walk inside to grab a lunch and see how they do. 
When I got inside, they quickly gave me some tea. The tea was fairly bitter and tasted kind of bland. I don't think the people who work here speak English very well, and I ended up speaking Cantonese Chinese to them. The t-shirts they wore were pretty cool as well. 
I ordered the Fish with tofu over rice. The fish was pretty bony, but there was a decent crisp in the fish, and I thought it was decent at the best. It is not high on my recommendations to order at this place unless you do not mind eating fish meat from the bone. The tofu was pretty good though as well as the rice. The dish also had some Chinese mushrooms and ginger as well. The ginger put some flair into the flavour of the dish, while the mushrooms were pretty tasty. Portions were pretty good and I got my stomach full. As for the prices, most of the dishes were under £9, so it's fairly inexpensive for a city like London. I paid £5.70 for my dish, which is probably the least amount of money I spent for a meal in London so far. 
Overall, this is not a bad place to grab something inexpensive to eat in London and I would not mind coming back here again. However, I would not recommend getting the Fish with tofu over rice.",-1
2,"Stopped in at around 2000 hrs on a Saturday evening. There was plenty of seating, so I sat in the main dining room and ordered the beef chow fun. The version they served was a gloppy, soupy mess, with pieces of noodle and beef swimming in an unidentifable sauce. It was definitely not the sauteed rice noodles I expected. So I'd stay away -- given the huge number of choices in the immediate area, you can do a whole lot better elsewhere for about the same prices.",-1
4,"It's a tradition in my university sports club to eat here so I may be biased, but I absolutely love this place. However, this is not recommended for any delicate diners. The food is actually incredibly good for the most part, with some of the best duck soup noodles and soft shell crab locally in my opinion (a lot of the local competitors use a lot of veg in their soup so a lot of the rich duck flavour is lost). It is very good value for money, with massive portions, and is very cheap. You can tell it's cheap from the decor, the tableware and the fact that Wong Kei is infamous for it. Do not expect Western-style service. You will not get it. The waiting staff are very quick and also very to-the-point and for the majority of times I've been there, are not going to faff around. I personally have no problem with this but I know it's not for everyone. If you are a couple, you may be seated at a large table with other people if they're very busy. You could always wait for a smaller table to become available but it could be said to be part of the Wong Kei experience. This has only happened to me once and I've been as a pair several times, usually being seated downstairs on the smaller tables.
Great food, great price for said food, and exceptionally fast service.",1
2,"Wong Kei. The best part about this is the name which let's be honest is a bit hilarious. Especially when your aunt keeps saying it in a slightly northern accent. She was raving about the Singapore fried noodles here and since she was the woman of the hour, we went.
The place looks like a canteen on a large scale. Not to worry, I thought, the best Chinese places tend to look unimpressive as they care solely about the food. So I said to myself (no I didn't say ""Self""...I mean who actually does that?) that I'd judge it on the food alone with just a bit on the service.
The service overall was pretty good, barring a slight issue at the beginning where they refused to put two tables together (there were roughly 15 of us in the group). Why you ask? No, not because they were too busy or that they didn't' have the tables (they were about half full at best and could easily seat 100 covers), but rather because they ""just didn't do that"". A bit of an odd response for a restaurant to have as I'd imagine keeping 15 hungry diners in a half empty restaurant is a pretty good idea business wise. So we had a mini-standoff between several angry Indian mums and 2 Chinese guys...needless to say the mums won.
Anyways, finally seated together, I get left with the dubious honour of ordering for the group (as seems to happen more often these days...). Naturally we got several portions of these Singapore fried noodles along with a selection of meat dishes and a roast Peking duck to start.
The duck was alright but by no means up to par with that for the Four Seasons (the lovely restaurant in Queensway or Chinatown not the hotel). It has some decent flavour but too much of the fat had been rendered away leaving the meat just a tad dry. We also ran out of pancakes quite quickly and couldn't get the attention of any of the waitstaff to ask for more.
The meat dishes we had ordered (the typical staples of Westernised Chinese dining) included beef in black bean sauce, pork in oyster sauce and chilli, cashew chicken, and grilled eel. The eel turned out to be a popular favourite despite not being the melt in your mouth bbq eel I had expected. It was grilled with the skin on and a light flavourful sauce. The skin was too rubbery to really eat but had done an excellent job of protecting the tender meat within. The rest of the dishes could not distinguish themselves from the average Chinese takeout but were satisfying in general.
Finally, the Singapore noodles. I love my aunt, but I don't know what she was on about with these things. They tasted a bit bland and limp and lacked any of the fiery bite of other such noodle dishes I've tried nor did it have sufficient variety in texture to be appealing. They functioned just fine as a base for other dishes but then again so does egg fried rice. Overall, very disappointed in this but that might be due to the hype as well. 
Thoughts: It's cash only so be sure to bring a few notes. Price wise it's pretty decent with the whole meal coming up to around £10pp (which in true asian fashion was fought over with each adult trying to pay for all of it). You can BYOB but they will charge you a corkage fee of £3-5/bottle that they see. So bring a case of identical bottles, just open one, and switch out the empties for a full one whenever the staff aren't around!",-1
3,"I used to go here a lot in my teens and the banter from the staff was phenomenal. I went here again after years of absence and now sadly it seems that Wong Kei's unique selling point has gone and it's no different to any other restaurant in Chinatown.
The building itself is pretty big so I've never had to wait for a table and I've been after London protests when numbers are higher than normal.
The food was ok but not amazing, certainly not better than any of the restaurants that surround it.
If you need a guaranteed place to eat, especially if you're a large group then this is the place to go but other than that it's nothing to write home about. Bring back the banter!!!",-1
3,"So we walked around trying to compare prices in the close area and we thought this was the best price one for us college kids. (And the 'FREE TEA' got to us, haha)
Decor: Nice & cozy; they have a downstairs seating area too
Service: Hah, they expect you to know what you want within minutes, and we took FOREVER to decide. But they were nice about it! And some of us spoke canto, so the guy chatted with us for a little bit and that was nice.
Food: 
- Ma Po Tofu: really good! I was surprised, considering it isn't really a canto dish. If you order this, remember to get a rice dish or just a (pretty large) bowl of rice (for about 1.50?)
- Roast Duck (cold): I didn't particularly like it because it was really fatty (Though I know some people like it) and I found it a bit salty (yet again, some people like that).
- Yang Zhou Fried Rice: DELICIOUS. haha, get it!
- Choi Sum w/garlic: pretty good, not what I would say best I've ever had. It wasn't the freshest, but the garlic was good (it was his recc).
Price: We had 4 people and it came up to 10 pounds a person, which isn't too bad since I was pretty stuffed.
Overall: I'm pretty happy about this place! I'll still be searching for other Chinese restaurants before I say this is my top place.",-1
4,"I saw a guy here asking for an itemised bill and being told to suck a duck. He started bleating about 'but in a restaurant...' The waiter shouted 'This not restaurant, this eating house!'
Sums it up.
One of life's reliable pleasures is going here by myself with a book and eating duck noodle soup (brought out within a minute of ordering it - 1.5 minuets after walking into the place) and slurping down hot, free tea.",1
5,"ok, its true Wong Kei has a very bad reputation - but people who hate it simply don't know how the restaurant runs:
- its a ""no-thrills"" restaurant, its cheap - you can't expect customer service!
- to eat here, just follow the following rules:
1. if you by yourself, grab a chair and sit - they will come find you with FREE tea!
2. if you're with a friend (so 2 of you), just say 2 or put 2 fingers up (the right way round of course), they will say go upstairs or downstairs (most likely downstairs - they have a system!)
3. the more people, the more fingers
-they speak good English, Cantonese and Mandarin!
- when you think their rude, you have to realise they work extremely long hours, don't earn much and don't expect to be tipped like Americans! so cut them some slack!
I love this restaurant not because their food is amazing - its so so and CHEAP! - but because I don't have to worry I'm eating alone, I can relax alone - everyones about their own business - everyone sits with everyone, sometimes you talk to strangers if you feel like it, or just keep to yourself - here you can be yourself and don't worry about being judged.
Conclusion: Cheap! and maybe cheerful (if you've done the right thing!)",1
3,"I went here about 6 months ago with one of my best friends who can speak Cantonese so that was very helpful for a start and because she'd been here quite a few times, she knew the best place to sit was higher up the restaurant. Apparently on the Ground Floor they're really rude to you - which was ironic as they certainly wouldn't have won any awards for being particularly friendly on our (the third) floor - and it is one of those establishments that is famous / infamous for being rude and that's part of the attraction for some people frequently the joint. Each to their own I guess. 
The food was delicious and the service okay, but it was annoying to be sat at a table with two pervy older men who sat and drooling over my friend and I for our entire meal and I felt particularly uncomfortable when she went off to the loo and I was left with them. 
When it the time came for us to pay our bill, it was annoying to be told that they did not take cards and that we would have to go to the nearest cash point. The waiter even shouted loudly, ""SHE (nodding at me) can go and get money out, whilst YOU (aimed at my friend) wait here."" We did this after saying, tactfully, how ridiculous it was that they weren't in the 21st Century and didn't have the ability to take card payments. When the waiter was being rude, this was when it was useful that my friend could speak Cantonese as she had a slight, let's call it, debate with the rude waiter. 
Great location and very convenient, just make sure you come armed with cash and attitude - and you're probably better in a group so then it'll just be you sat on your table!",-1
2,"Went here more than three times already but this time they gave me an unpleasant service. There were four of us and we ordered two dishes to share but the waitress did not want to accept our order saying each of us has to order one meal. She was rude to us, took the menu from our table without asking nicely and only said ""cannot cannot"". Clearly her English wasn't very good. I had better experience previously but this time they made me not want to go back there again for their bad service.",-1
1,"Do not waste your time.  The service here is completely terrible.  I don't care how good the food is,I wouldn't let my dog eat here based on how rude they were.",-1
5,"Wow!  The cheapest, tastiest Chinese meal I've had in London.  A huge restaurant with 4 floors, and so efficient.  For people dining by themselves, sit on the main floor.  For larger parties, keep walking upstairs.....  
Like most Chinese restaurants, waiters are brusque and very fast.  Empty dishes seem to disappear in the blink of an eye.  The bill comes almost telepathically to your table.  
The food.... so good.  I had a roast duck noodles, which was all of £4.20?  Seriously?  It was delicious and filling and just what I needed.  I shall be back again.  
BTW - my rule of thumb for Chinese restaurants - usually it's good if a) there is a lot of bad grammar on the menus, plastic tablecloths, lots of people, it's slightly dirty, and brusque staff.  All achieved with Wong Kei.",1
4,"Cheap and cheerful. Brisket of beef with rice or noodles is a favourite.
And for only £3.90!
Admittedly they're not the best for roast duck or pork just a few shops away, so stick to the noodle or rice dishes.
They're good for solo dining or a quick meal before movies etc.",1
3,"It's Chinese fast food. It was busy mid afternoon and we shared a table Chinese-style with another couple. The food was forgettable, but fast and cheap. Three stars for it being a step above the overpriced tourist traps that comprise the rest of London's Chinatown.",-1
4,"If you're after a cheap place, decent food and a good serving size, Wong Kei ticks these boxes. My usual orders are the pork porridge and black bean aubergine on rice. This is a no frills place, I've never had to wait in line and always walk out full.",1
2,"Please avoid. Cheap but untidy. Doesn't taste bad per-say, but I certainly wouldn't say it tastes good. I'm a tourist from New York City, and this sure left a bad impression of Chinatown on me until I visited other restaurants surrounding this place.
London Jade Garden down the street is so amazing and authentic, please don't come here and ruin your appetite.",-1
3,"Cheap & cheerful, if you're in a rush this place is ideal, super efficient service. Downstairs is good for single diners & upstairs you either share a table or get your own if in a larger party. 
Dishes can be hit & miss, but you can't really complain when they are about  5GBP per dish.
What happened to the rudeness, they've got more polite over the years!",-1
4,"After a few or more sticky sweet drinks in Soho I love stumbling down to Wong Kei, not only to snicker at the name, but to devour their fast, hot and dazzling dishes.
The service here is brisk if not quite rude but none of the patrons seem to mind as they are more concerned about what they will soon be shoveling into their pieholes and when the tube will shut.
I always get the crispy duck which they somehow manage to bring out in whole pieces and in record time, armed with only spoons, they've managed to reduce to a beautiful pile of scrumptious duck.  
Whenever I go with friends we order as a table so we can take a bit from each others plates but staples definately include crispy duck and pancakes, singapore noodles, spring rolls, and chicken balls.
My only real complaint is that I always have to run out to get cash to pay!",1
5,"If you like Chinese then you will like Wonkies. Its situated on the end of China town in the height of central London. The food is great, the service is quick and the quality is fabulous.
The thing is about Wonkies and this is whether you like traditional Chinese meals or not there service of feeding people is known all around London and the rest of the world, the prices are reasonable and the restaurant itself has the all the Feng Shui you need to know where you at, what style of food your eating and more importantly you will be able to eat in the knowledge your not being over charged.
The grubs great, its always busy and the staff there have been there since day one. This business is making money, and they need to because the overheads down West End are sky rocket.
The type of people who eat in this restaurant vary, you have the traditional China town residents, regulars and people like me who venture down West regularly to eat Chinese food. Even if it was not Chinese food I would probably still eat there, because I like Chinese tea (sound familiar?). If so you will love Wonkies as am sure you already know having been there is you get free green tea, not just any old green tea but green tea that helps you clear your palette before eating and green tea that helps you wash down your food.
If I have any grumbles about Wonkies it is about the pepper, now it has not happened for a while perhaps because its the summer and the air is much drier but previously I have found the pepper shaker to be blocked. This means simply tapping the pot and sometimes means having to take of the top lid and scrape away the troublesome blocks of pepper, once years ago the pepper fell out onto my food, but anyway I still ate it because I get very hungry. I once invited my pops and brother but unfortunately they declined coming and took me to the pub instead.
Well what did they miss out on rather than just speaking about the free condiments and wonderful abundance of chopsticks. Sweet and sour is always a favourite with us English. For the health fanatics out there I recommend asking the waiter for greens with your meals, the crispy belly pork is great. The best thing about Wonkies though is the duck is does not matter whether your talking duck pancakes or Duck on rice is all very yummy. Another great meal if your ok with pork and don't mind prawns is a pasta based meal. This meal is called fried Quon Dou its yummy just try it with a huge dollop of the yummy chilli sauce, you will not regret this one the foods great.
Sea lovers ship ahoy there's a great meal that is a set meal with pasta that comes with yummy fish-balls calamari or squid and a yummy spinach based leave to soak up the gooey sauce.
If your in two minds about eating Chinese when your down the West End in London and are unsure where to turn or take your large party of hungry friends then Wonkies is where you should turn.
P.S. Another little tip there is often budget meals on the walls with special that are not necessarily on the menu, there nice but I would not get to distracted the food I spoke of here is well worth checking out for now. If your really adventurous your could try the intestines or the offal dishes but I usually go with what's your normal Chinese grub, but if its a dessert your after your stuffed there are no sweets at Wonkies. Final note yes they do sell Chang beer. Happy eating.",1
5,"Wong Kei's has been famous for being rude to customers for over 20yrs it is why people use to go, usually to take a friend who was none the wiser & then sit back in amusement & watch their look of horror & disbelief on their faces, as the staff are abrupt & rude & normally move you to another table at least once during your meal, for no apparent reason, often 2 or 3 times. 
I haven't been for a while. I really must go back & relive that de ja vou experience again!! 
I hope it hasn't changed, as it's just so much fun, you could always clock the diners who were, in on the joke & those who are new to the delights of Wong Kei's, the tasty cheap food always comes 2nd to the side show entertainment, that is the waiters & newbee customers!! I have been eating there on & off 20yrs & it never fails to be an amusing night out! 
Very cheap food, but still tasty & very abrupt rude staff, who will be ruder to your newbee diner friend if you slip them a few quid!",1
4,"The noodle soups here are so good... and SO cheap, actually the cheapest I've found in Chinatown.
The staff are definitely not friendly or warm, I can't comment on any of the other dishes on the menu because I've never tried them (and probably never will) I love it here because it reminds me of traveling and because I have a noodle soup addiction and am in need of serious help.
(... Oh and theres free tea)",1
3,"It may be a while since anyone eating here was greeted with the then-traditional, What the f~~k you want?, but this was, in reality, one of the things that marked Wong Kei's out ( along with communal seating, now a pretty normal feature  as a tangental comment you have to wonder at big chains like Wagamama taking a leaf from a famously rude restaurant's book). Which pretty much leaves it as a cheap, OK Chinese restaurant ( surrounded by cheap, OK restaurants).",-1
2,"Bad service. Bad food. 
Super cheap. 
The worst restaurant review I ever gave out. 
You might like this place if (1) you have never had Chinese food before, (2) you like dickheads to serve your table, (3) you enjoy sitting next to some stranger, watching them slurping noodles, and getting their saliva/broth all over your face. 
If you love your stomach and want a stranger's-saliva-free face, stay away.",-1
4,"Perhaps the only place where you go to eat *because* of the bad attitude and rudeness of the staff.  Actually, that might be part of the charm initially but we keep coming back because we love the no-fuss food and the great prices.
The actual building might be related to a tardis because it appears to never end. On various visits we have been sat, down down stairs, in the middle bit, in the weirdly more upmarket upstairs bit and now and then in this weird 'down the hallway' bit that takes so long to walk to I think we were actually in Leicester Square by the time we reached our table.
More often than not, we order the same set meal for two because it is such a good value (under £8 per person) and because we love everything they serve as part of it. It is served family style and comes with sweet and sour pork, steamed Chinese vegetables, black bean beef ,chicken with mushrooms and a large amount of white rice.. We agree that their sweet and sour pork is the best we have had anywhere. 
Don't get me wrong, Wong Kei's is the 'greasy cafe' variety of Chinese food but since I am a non-flashy type of gal that works great for me. I love the little quirks like the waiters being just the right side of rude, the cheap plastic plates and the luminous pots of chilli sauce that are always sitting on the table.
It is wise to have some competence with chopsticks if you eat here but I am sure the waiters that do speak a bit of English would have no problem humiliating you a bit as they found you a fork.",1
2,"Don't sit on the ground floor in winter time. You will freeze.
Their food is basically OK. most of the time it comes super speedily, once I had to wait quite a while (I have a feeling they forgot my order). Ma Po tofu was a touch slimy, singapore noodles pretty standard if a little salty. Rice is usually overcooked, which is surprising to see in a chinese restaurant.
Redeeming qualities: freakin' cheap. Massive portions. Free Tea. Hilarious. Always interesting if you're on your own.",-1
4,"Hahahahahahhahahahahahahaha.
Best value Chinese restaurant in the area.
Portion sizes are decent (even for Americans).
Service is fast and brutal.
It is inexpensive.
Order the Singapore fried noodle. Its a little salty but otherwise tasty as a futhermucker.
One of the few places in London where people (and for this read women)
can eat on their own without feeling uncomfortable (no upstairs for you!)
I miss the days when they were incredibly rude and threw the menus at you *sigh*",1
4,"Wong Kei is great!
Decent portions of food at very good prices. Cash only but good for a group as they have big round tables.
The service isn't great but you almost go there for that, as it adds to the experience as long as you're expecting it!",1
2,"The food was okay (though a warning, the hot pot isn't like shabu shabu, it is literally rice in a warm pot) and the portion sizes were pretty good. The service was very brusque and it felt like we were being rushed out the door. Compared to the Chinese food I've had in the US, it wasn't particularly good and seemed very greasy. Though it was better than Panda Express and it was a pretty cheap meal, I won't be going again.",-1
5,"I stayed for a week in London and ate here five times!  Yes, I ate here five times.  The prices are a bargain compared to other Chinatown restaurants.  For example, I had eel with black bean sauce over rice for 5.7 GBP and the comparable dish is 13.8 GBP next door.
Granted, their try to rush the customers through, but I still enjoyed eating here and will definitely return.
If you speak Cantonese, you will be treated respectfully.",1
3,"If you are looking for a wonderfully polite service, attentive to your every need, this isn't it. However what you can guarantee is good food, well cooked and fast. Part of the allure of Wong Kei's are the surly, busy waiters running around like flies and doing their best to avoid the wrath of their manager.
 From most of the reviews on this page you can see the service is non-existent, but almost everyone agrees the food is tasty. And better still, it is cheap as chips (or chow mein). If you want a good night out with a group of friends, where better to go than a bustling noisy Chinese restaurant, where the conversation will be endless thanks to a few impolite members of staff.",-1
5,"I used to frequent Wong Kei Restaurant while living in London.  The restaurant serves good size authentic food.  The waiters tend to be borderline obnoxious at times.  The place is normally overflowing with patrons.  When I visit for lunch on my own, I normally will be seated next to someone else due to lack of space.
The prices are affordable, not a tourist in sight and the rudeness of the staff is, for the most part, simply hysterical.",1
3,"Like others, I went expecting the 'rudest restaurant in London', but despite the waiter not wanting to sell us any drinks (their loss, I guess), it wasn't actually too bad.
 Portions were a decent size, and the set menu meal deal for two (£12 each) was reasonable value, though a bit more expensive than I was expecting considering how cheap the place is made out to be.
 Expect to share a table with others, especially if you're not in a big group. I've had better food in Chinatown, but then again I've had far, far worse!",-1
2,"Its good to see lots of reviews about this place!
 The main points of Wong Kei are:
 1) Cheap cheap cheap. You won't find cheaper Chinese food elsewhere in Chinatown.
2) Waiting staff are stretched thin, and customer satisfaction is their lowest priority as they have way too many tasks to handle.
3) Food is decent for the price paid
4) During busy times you might have to share a table with others",-1
2,"Location= Yes = 1*
Chinese tea = Yes please 1*
Me and my (previous partner at the time) decided to celebrate our 2 years together (shivers) at Wong Kei's. 
Soon as we arrived at the door, the waiter came up to us and took us downstairs to our seats. It felt like we was in the middle of rush hour (no not the film!). 
I ordered Singapore noodles and he ordered special fried rice. I'm telling you the noodles was so dry that I had trouble finishing it! And you know when you can tell that the waiters are waiting for you to finish your meal and leave..I swear I could read their mind...'HURRY UP AND BYE' (accent)! Not a pleasant experience and the sight of my previous partner did not make a difference.
So all in all, would I go there again? No comment",-1
3,I went there for a dinner with my husband and first thing I didnt like was sharing table with 6 other people. I was hoping for privacy but ok I guess thats fine. Theres was just a lot of other empty tables and I dont think few groups o f 8 would come right after. The server was very rude and rush me a LOT! Luckly the food was very very good so I belive thats the most important part.,-1
4,"I have been eating here for over 20 years and I have to say, it isn't because I love their food..it is purely the entertainment value of the staff. If there are a more surly bunch of customer facing employees anywhere in the world, then they must be on a Pirate ship. I have never seen the manager smile and he doesn't so much as show you to your table, as frog march you to it!
I love it!",1
5,"I don't go to other Chinese Restaurants anymore.
There's just no point; they're not Wong Kei.
 It's fast paced, no fuss and efficient service - this place runs on high customer turnover and plenty of customers there are.
 The menu is vast and so are the portions and the prices are extremely favourable. The food tastes great and you get plenty for your money.
 The restaurant is actually 4 storeys, all pretty different - the lower ground floor is like a canteen with a water feature, the ground floor like a diner and the upper floors like a rather nice uptown restaurant, it's a bit of a lottery where you get seated - at busy times you might share a larger table with other diners, wagamama style.
 If you want to feel spoiled when you go out for CHinese, you won't like it, but if you want good value, good food, and if you're in a hurry and want to be served quickly and get out quickly this will definitely do the trick! 
Not that you can't take your time - no one pressures you to leave or anything, but if you do want the bill they'll happily get it to you double quick. :-)",1
3,"Very run of the mill Chinese food. But cheap and plentiful. Get the set dinner menu, they will just bring out a bunch of food... no decisions have to be made. One of the dishes was fried something... we thought it was just fried fried.",-1
5,"It is 11:45 am and Wong Kei restaurant is already brimming with custom. This place seems so authentic I could swear I was in China. The servers are abrupt, yet organised to a level most people could never reach. Strangely for the location there seems a distinct lack of tourists, yet this large eatery is full of people who seem to know exactly what they want. I am watching people sit and receive their meals within five minutes. My beef ho fun and egg fried rice takes a little longer. I've kept myself busy with the free pot of green tea every customer gets, so I don't mind. Once I start eating I slip into noodle heaven. My ho fun is excellent. The chilli's are hot, the peppers crunchy and the beef tender.
I know some people will not like the random seating, but I enjoy sitting with strangers who are there for the same thing, a good, quick and tasty meal. This is not the kind of place to bring a date, but if you want a great meal in your lunch hour, I can think of nowhere better than Wong Kei.",1
5,"When I was in high school and living in Surrey, we used to travel into the city by train on the weekends.  Since the food was so cheap and we were all broke, Wong Kei (Wonkys) became a staple in our lives.  It is so refreshing to see from Yelp reviews that nothing has changed.  They still treat everybody like shit and the food is still good and cheap.
I will never forget being seated with a group of total strangers the first time.  The man said, ""you sit here"".  I sat.  A minute later, I told the same man that there was a noodle in my spoon (hoping to get a clean spoon).  He shook the spoon, knocking the noodle to the floor and said, ""here"".  These are the reasons Wonkys gets 5 stars in my book.  Unforgettable memories.",1
4,"This place is great!! It's definitely a 'no frills' restaurant, from the decor to the service but the food is good and reasonably priced for Chinatown. We usually have the set meal at £12 a head which is excellent value as you do get a lot of food!! The first time I came here with friends we ordered the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu at £9.95, definitely not a good move as it tasted akin to how I imagine battery acid would taste!! On our next visit we opted for a slightly more expensive bottle at £12.95 and were presented with a perfectly drinkable white wine.
 Be prepared to share one of the large round tables with complete strangers, but that's half the fun of the Wong Kei experience, that and the waiters who've never heard of customer care!!",1
2,"It had been a while since I last ate at Wong Kei. I didn't remember much of it so I decided to try it again recently. 
If you don't mind being shouted at, your not bothered about the service and just after cheap (but not amazing) food then this place is ok. Personally, I won't be eating there again.",-1
4,"Wonky's, as Wong Kei has come to be known, is the John McEnroe of Chinatown restaurants. Rumour has it that Mr McE has it written in his contract that he has to throw a few tantrums when he plays on the senior tour, otherwise the fans would feel shortchanged. Well, people go to Wonky's for the cheap and tasty Chinese food but also for the drama and the slight adrenaline rush from the fear arising from any interaction with the staff.
Famous Wonky's phrases
""Sit down there!""
""What you want?""
""Share table!""
""You cannot be serious!"" Ooops sorry that was a McEnroe!
And if you can speak Cantonese, listening to the waitresses' comments about the customers can bring a wry smile or shocked horror to your face depending on your view of what customer service should be about.
Anyway onto the food. I find the ground floor a nice spot for a single diner and the single plates with BBQ meats or fried or noodles in soup tasty and good value for money. The cavernous multi-floor restaurant is quite frequently full and you may have to share tables, which proves that the old ones like McEnroe are still the best entertainers.",1
4,"Wong Kei's food is okay and the prices are excellent.
The waiters are famous for being rude to people but unfortunately they have never been especially rude to me.
Anyway, I like it. Recommended for a nice cheap lunch.",1
5,"This place is a london classic. I remember going here once a few years back and enjoying an evening's free entertainment as a bunch of drunk so-and-so's started a massive fight with the waiters good times. The resteraunt isn't really like that anymore though and the staff are a lot more friendly nowadays. The food is cheap; dirt cheap by London standards. Expect to pay about 3 quid for most mains (noodles/rice dishes etc) and up to ten quid for some of the pricier dishes. The menu is variable in quality but most dishes are ok and some are true gems. The singapore noodles, for example, are some of the best in London and the Hong Kong style pork chops are another highlight. Service is a little curt but, as I said, not so unfriendly anymore and very quick.",1
2,"I am not sure how to follow Smartiboo's experience of Wong Kei, but I am always surprised by the number of English people who know about this place and actually claim to ""like"" Wong Kei.
 Well, I don't. I find the arrogant waiters ignorant and annoying, and even though Chinese waiters have been known to be a little short, these people have turned rudeness into an art form. As I understand Cantonese, I am also not too happy with some conversations I have overheard.
 I was here several years ago when the decor was ""Paint Peeling Off Wall"". They have since spruced it up a bit so that most of the paint is now actually on the wall. And that is about the best I can say, but this is actually not a criticism as lots of good places in China have somewhat basic decor, or worse.
 The food is not too bad, I have to admit, especially for the price, so if you want to eat well and reasonably cheaply, then this is definitely one place to consider. However, this place was a lot cheaper years ago. By the way, NEVER order the set menus - they are invariably crap and made up mostly of food they couldn't sell the day before.
 But whatever you do, please don't bother leaving a tip for the waiters - as they say, they don't expect it and it will only embarrass them! :o)",-1
4,"I keep going back here yet the toilets are disgusting, the waiters have less charm than a brick wall and the place reeks of stale fat and buckets. Why? Because its cheap and fast. When eating out in one of the most expensive areas of central London, Soho, and in need of a quick bite to eat, you can eat here if you ditch your snobbiness at the front door and grow a thick skin in case one of the waiters decides to kick off at you.
 The best dish by far (and the cheapest) is the crispy aromatic duck. I've never seen it cheaper in London; half a duck will keep 3 grown men happy-chappy!
 But seriously, this restaurant is a hidden gem in Soho and well worth a visit. You'll hate it when you arrive but leave thinking you've been given a bargain. Just stay away from the toilets and be sure to be quick ordering your food!",1
1,"Reading the previous reviews I was ""warned"" about the rude waiters but did expect some decent food. I was underwhelmed, to say the least.
 We ordered the 12,50 set menu. The first dish was a mixture of deep fried assortments, which tasted all the same, the plate was lushly decorated with cheap deep fried sea weed. Obviously they do not change their frying oil a lot.
 The duck pancakes that followed were nice, but then again what can possibly go wrong in making these?
 The biggest disappointment of all was, however, the mains: 5 saggy dishes of very low quality food, all of them in sticky sweet sauces. They all looked like they had been prepared hours before and kept in a water bath. The fried rice was evidently done with powdered egg and the meat in the dishes was of very low quality, not to mention the watery vegetables.
 Neither was the food good nor was it cheap for what it was. We left feeling like we had eaten glue. This was the first time that a qype recommendation let me down and I was well embarrassed in front of my guests.",-1
5,"Absolutely crazy place, about a million covers, decent good value food.",1
3,"My first china-town experience in London..... not bad, not great.... about in the middle.....  and especially since it's my first.  
Compared to Chinese in the states, this is pretty poor.... but at least these people looked chinese, and seemed to understand a bit of the chinese that my parents were speaking to them.
but hey... its nice once in a while having something that actually resembles chinese food... I don't know if mexicans feel the same way in california... shrug",-1
2,"After 3+ months of cuisine française, I wanted to tuck into something more familiar on our first night in London. After figuring out where Chinatown was on the tube map we made our way there and stumbled into Wong Kei since it was the first ""decent"" looking restaurant that wasn't a cheap looking buffet. 
This place is cavernous, with three floors and people shuffling in and out when it gets busy. The wait staff is cold and quite unfriendly, even by Chinese restaurant standards, however they get the job done. The food is standard Cantonese noodle house fare, though unlike the case Tayyabs, where the food was better than what I had in the US, the offerings here were in the opposite direction. Their clay pot rice, while tasting ok, didn't come in a clay pot and thus didn't have the unique texture and crunch on the bottom that its supposed to have. While the chow fun was on par which what I was used back home the won-ton soup lacked flavor and the duck over rice came covered in candy-sweet dark brown sauce, which I think was a nod to local tastes, since I had seen the exact same thing in Glasgow. In any case, this place is inexpensive by London standards and will satisfy your Cantonese food fix. Mostly.",-1
3,"Wong Kei is notorious for its extremely rude staff and cheap tasty Chinese food. The rudeness of the staff has to be seen to be believed but people keep returning to China Town's largest restaurant.
Why? Well the prices have probably remained the same in years which is good news in these credit crunch times. Wong Kei is a no nonsense fast food restaurant- don't expect to relax after your meal with a glass of wine. The next 'batch' of customers will be nearby ready to sit in your seats as soon as you have paid the bill. It's not so much service with a smile as service with a snarl.
The food is always good although that cannot be said for the interior- I wouldn't describe it as dirty but another paint job is definately long overdue. Do NOT come here for a romantic meal because you are seated with strangers on the circular tables.
It might not be for you but I always know what to expect- good value Chinese food but no customer service. That's fine with me and they are so abrupt it's almost entertaining.",-1
4,"If you know what to expect, then this place is great. It's not like the old days when part of the attraction was surliness of the staff, but you are still herded in and sat with strangers around the big tables (a friend of mine was once sat on the same table as Noel Gallagaher). 
The food is good, arrives quickly, and is cheap. It's not the place for a nice relaxing or romantic meal, but if you want to get off the streets and have some good cheap food with others doing the same then it's great. Here's a tip, try talking to the people you get sat with, most times I've met quite a few interesting people.
If you can't use chopsticks you will have to ask for a fork, and the constant free teapots of Chinese tea are a big bonus!",1
3,"I been there several times, that doesn't mean that restaurant is great. The price and taste were OK for me when I was a student. I couldn't remember too much things over there. I just remember that I have to eat with some strangers by the same table and the service was sucks, but I was OK with that. It is kind of unaccepted condition for me right know. Do I really grow up?",-1
4,"I like the price the most.. AND the food is pretty good. What more can you ask for?
Don't expect good service, though. But it's not as bad as before I hear.",1
5,"This place is awesome for so many reasons. Yeah, yeah, yeah the food is great but the entertainment is even better. Entertainment, you say? Oh yes, entertainment. It comes in the form of the wait staff here who make a game out of abusing the guests as much as they can without actually providing bad service. They're feisty, loud and over-agressive but if you know what you want to order you can guarantee that you're going to get it in a matter of seconds and it will be exactly what you ordered. ahunter summed it up beautifully as ruthlessly efficient. I ordered a Tsing Tao beer and it was in my hand before I even finished the last incorrectly pronounced syllable. Oh and it came with one of those old school pull tops. Awesome.
 The food is truly excellent and served in the traditional family style of throw everything in the middle and fight over it. It really made me feel like I was back living in Hong Kong. One of the most satisfying Chinese restaurant experiences I've had in a long time.
 Great location, great food, great service.
 WHATCHOO WANT?!",1
4,"cheap ok food best out of all Chinese café , but remember its not Authentic Chinese food try one down street but wong kei price and taster way better",1
5,"Amazing restaurant in a buzzing location. Quick, delicious and hot food was exactly what I wanted and so I received just that. Waiters are a tad rude but the food is excellent. Be prepared to sit on a table with strangers but overall, you wont be disappointed especially not at the cheap prices.",1
2,"I heard from many friends' ""recommendation"" and visited this notoriously ""famous""  restaurant when I was in London seven years ago.
The food served there was dirt cheap.  I recalled it started at four and half pounds per dish.  The portion was extremely huge -- enough to fill up the stomach of two hungry customers.
Of course the taste is awful -- unless you have never tried any Chinese food.
And I could tell how rude those waiters treated the ""haole"" (Hawaiian word for Caucasian) customers.  But the restaurant was packed with haole on that day.  Why did they enjoy being abused?",-1
4,"Best value Chinese you can find.
Always a seat available (because it's freakin' huge), food comes out fast, quality is low - but good, and it's CHEAP.
Service isn't as bad as it used to be.. (think older London tour books talk about how terrible the service is...)",1
4,"Following the reviews from Mssrs A and A Hunter in particular, I went on a date to this place. Chinese generally isn't my favourite cuisine but I will certainly come back here. It's as efficient in service and atmosphere as the other reviews suggest, but I really didn't feel rushed at all, and we stayed to finish our wine with no indication that they wanted us to leave!
 A pot of chinese tea was put immediately on our table, and we went for the house wine - a risk a) in a cheap chinese and b) at £7 a bottle - but it was dry and perfectly drinkable! We started with the finest crispy duck pancakes I've probably ever eaten, then we both had won ton soup. Delicious broth with noodles (which were slightly undercooked), with 5 or 6 giant pork and prawn dumplings. Delicious. We had chinese greens on the side - a giant pile of steaming hot stems with oyster sauce. It was all extremely tasty and we couldn't even finish it all. And the bill? £22 inc the wine. Have already told everyone I know about this place!",1
4,"First off, the service is here is crap, if it is existent at all. Surly waiters dump your dishes down, never bother with requests for tea refills, and give you your bill before you've finished eating.
 But fortunately, that's the worst of it. By persevering, you'll enjoy good food at a low price. I normally get the duck rice or the 3-meat rice, which is good value considering the amount of meat you get. But I would advise anyone coming here not to order any of their wet noodles, which can be fairly bland.
 Food comes quickly too, so after some grocery shopping at Chinatown, here's a place you can go before running home.",1
5,"Lots of stars because I remember the food being good. I haven't been for a loooooong time but the fact that it's still going strong says something for it.
 The main draws used to be the cheap but good Chinese food and the utter contempt that the waiters showed every single customer. The last time I was there I caught one of them basically telling a customer to piss off in Cantonese (something I picked up from martial arts movies). It was hilarious!
 Anyway, the reason I write is because my brother went in the other day and actually got service with a smile. And he said the food was still good.
 Update: I put an extra star on 'cos I notice a lot of other people besides my brother say the waiters are more friendly now. It's perfect!",1
4,"This place is a fantastic experience, great food, near-comedy atmosphere and great great prices.
 Recommended to us by many of our family and friends, we just had to give it try. We'd heard the legends of rude and ruthlessly efficient service and arrived hoping to experience such.
 You definately have to give it a try if you are in the area, its cheap, cheerful and an experience not to be missed",1
4,"I can't believe people are marking this place down because of the service. Surely that's all part of what makes this restaurant such as institution?
 On my first trip down to London, the amount of people back here in Sheffield who said you must go to Wong Kei's to be abused was phenomenal. Their reputation has spread far and wide!
 Plus, where else can you go for food and exercise at the same time as you traipse up and downstairs? It's cheaper than gym membership!
 The waterfall downstairs looks like something a person with no discernible taste might have in their garden and the plates look like the indestructible ones they used to give us at primary school.
 The main reason to go though is the food. My partner is a notoriously fussy eater and I've never seen him clear a plate so fast. We had pork noodles and they were amazing and the jasmine tea was also nice. I think the meal we had added up to about a tenner and we were stuffed.
 A great place to go if you're not bothered about dressing up and going somewhere fancy.",1
3,"I had to see it to believe it, but what a great experience
 Yes the staff are notoriously rude and you usually end up on a table with complete strangers/confused tourists. But how on earth can you argue with the 3 course set dinner for £12 a head (and I'm talking crispy duck included). You can't you just can't.
 Did I mention the house wine is £8 a bottle, and they have no problem with doggie bags..",-1
5,"Why do so many Chinese people eat here? Because the food is Fantastic! Order anything from peking crispy duck to deep fried chilie salt squid and you cant expect anything but very traditional, superbly cooked food. I've never met anone with any complaints about the quality of the dishes. Excellent value for money as well..!
Service and seating arrangements leave much to be desired, but the food really does speak for itself, hence its 500 person capacity often being packed.",1
5,"I have been frequenting this institution for years. Its brilliant whether dining with friends or alone. The food is tasty, with huge portions at great value. I recommend the Char Siu (BBQ Pork). The service is famously abrupt but has improved and still retains a certain charm. The food is often delivered very quick - a plate of rice can be quicker, tastier and cheaper than McDonald's!
If you're happy with no frills tasty food, you found the right place.",1
4,"Agree with most of the reviews here that say that the waiting staff are comically rude.
 This is a typical Chinese canteen - a no frills experience on the inside, but the food is excellent for the price.
 I thoroughly recommend the Cold Roast Pork and Duck on warm rice - real bargain and generously portioned.",1
5,"For 26 years I have eaten Singapore Noodles at the Wonk, and they are Heaven. Fab noodles and a pretty tasty hot and sour soup too. See if you can get a tale on the ground floor. Only once in 26 years for me. We visit the Wonk every time we go to London.",1
1,"After looking at every menu at each restaurant in ChinaTown in the rain late last night, instead of going to the one that closes at 4am, for some reason we went to Wong Kei cos I think we were enticed by the No service charge and no charge for chinese tea lol I know restaurants in Chinatown arent known for the service and value for money but my gawd the service I recieved in here was the second worse Ive ever had!! (The first was in a chinese cafe in Toronto but thats another story!)
 The waiter didnt write down the order, came back to check, repeated the order back to him, later came the dishes except for one, told him but not only did he give me mouth, we never even recieve the dish we ordered!! We didnt say anything after only because we didnt want to spend any more money in there. The teapot came with a streak of chilli oil on the lid, the portions werent big, food was greasy, the place was just dirty with food all over the floor. We didnt even dare to go to the toilet!
 When the bill came, the dish we ordered which we never got wasnt written down either...so clearly he wasnt listening and didnt care and gave me mouth about it! Needless to say, we did not give a tip, never going back even if it was cheaper than other places, the food was greasy I may as well had a kebab probably would have been cheaper and tastier! Next time we will find a chinese restaurant outside of chinatown.",-1
3,"OK, everybody has heard about Wong Kei - especially how it 'used to be'. Well, now, I think most people think of this place as 'where can I get a good portion of Chinese food at a good price?' - well, this is the place.
 First tip upon entering is to ignore the waiters on the ground level trying to get you seated straight away on this level - they only do this so the tourists outside will see a busy restaurant and think it must be popular. I would continue walking passed them explaining you have friends upstairs waiting - as the nicest tables and environment are upstairs. My experiences of unfortunately being seated on the ground level is noise, bustle, flies (in the summer) and drafts.
 The food is plentiful, and usually tastes very good. My personal favourite is the Sweet&Sour Chicken with Rice. But the cheap Jasmin tea isn't something to savor, so I'd skip it for a beer or coke.
 We often bring groups of friends here for dinner, so much so that 'Mr Man' (the manager, I am told) often throws in a free extra dish :-)",-1
4,"Wong Kei (or 'wonky's) was a firm favourite when I was studying in London. Wong Kei makes its money by selling decent Chinese food at an electric pace. They can have you in, fed and out in under half hour but the experience is not to be missed.
There are a lot of horror stories about how food the service can be but it's more clinically efficient than out and out rude. You are told where to sit, you might be sat with a stranger, there is little banter with the waiting staff but the quick turnover, the meeting with strangers and the cheap, quality food make for a great experience. Enjoy.",1
4,"If like me you believe that eating should be a question of taking on fuel rather than some kind of quasi-religious social event then the Wonky in Soho is the place for you. The minute you're in the door you're basically grabbed by the scruff of the neck and shoved down at a table, often one that's already occupied by some Chinese person loudly slurping down noodles. A demand is made for what you want and a pot of Chinese tea is banged down in front of you, followed seemingly just seconds later by the dish of your choice. In my case this is usually lemon chicken and boiled rice: mm lovely! The place being something of an institution you can buy a Wong Kei t-shirt just like the waiters wear. Some say the waiters are rude here. A diner in Soho (possibly here) once had a request for a second cup of coffee answered with a barked: No: you pay, you go!. But to me they aren't rude, they're efficient. And I wear my t-shirt with pride. Be warned the place don't take credit cards though, so take some cash and spare yourself an embarrassing mid-meal trip to the cash point. And don't even think about using the toilets. Apart from that, absolutely great.",1
5,"Wong kei's is my favourite Chinese resturaunt and the only one I have visited more than 3 times.
Inside you can sit upstairs or downstairs and it seems like two different resturaunts visually. The food is fantastic and you really do get a lot for one dish so really great value for money.
You can spend about 5-10 pounds and be full.
I really liked the crispy duck, and they have some mean soups.
They provide you with a tasty tea while you wait and the service is sometimes quick sometimes a bit slow but it really depends on how busy it is.
 The selection of beer is not too vast but you are here for Chinese food not for the alcohol so that isn't too much of a bad thing. Inside is usualy quite packed but there is a great atmosphere in the resturaunt.
So overall probably one of the best Chinese resturaunts I have been to.",1
3,"Food was ok (not as good as some places I've been but not as bad as some others!) - the prawn toast didn't have very much prawn on it and was more sesame toast than anything else.
 There were no kerfuffles during our visit, the food was simple and quick, but wasn't of the most amazing quailty. Still, you get what you pay for!
 Converse to some opinions, the waiters were actually quite nice to us. It must have been pay-day!",-1
4,Roast duck noodle soup and fish ball noodle soup are perfect for a cold London day! YUM-wish I was there!,1
4,"Nothing beats a cold winter London night than a big bowl of noodle soup... even better when it's easy on your wallet.  The wonton noodle soup with chasui used to be my fave before I swore off meat.  I don't know about the rudeness.... everyone's is usually pretty nice when I visit, altho sometimes they are really busy and may not be as friendly.",1
4,Slipery floors but cheap and good quality. Kids will love it.,1
3,"Very large chinese restaurant, set over four floors and very popular with students and anyone looking for a cheap, quick meal. It is not one of the most plush restaurants I have frequented but the barbeque pork noodle soup is wonderful, at under £4 for a very large bowl, it is an excellent choice for a quick lunch.The restaurant also has an interesting seating policy, be prepared to be seated at large large round tables with other customers. This can be a positive thing, as I have had several interesting conversations over my noodle soup.",-1
5,"Impressively cheap! Even though the food is really cheap, they have very delicious roast pork and char siu! A plate of roast pork and char siu rice is only £4.50! The ginger and spring onion pork chop with rice is also very tasty! These two dishes are normally what I have with wonton soup as the starter! Inside  A DOWN TO EARTH simple interior! Quick service and fast food! Good for a fuss-free dinner before a night-out partying! A favourite everyday place to be!",1
4,"Cheap, incredibly quick service, great food, waiters that don't speak a word of English - just what Big Dave wants at 11.00pm after a night out on the beers. Big Dave recommends the shark fin soup... JOKES.",1
5,"The first time I ate in this restaurant was in 1979 when they were in Blue post alley. The menu stayed the same for many years and it was finaly changed in 2000 something. My favourite dish was always 114 (Singapore fried noodles) and 112 (Fried Quai Du). I went in after the menus changed and the numbers were removed. I asked for a 114 and the guess what? I got Singapore fried noodle. I was soo pleasedI felt like a veteran coming home.
I have not been there for 5 years or so and I am hoping that the numbers have come back in the meantime. As for the service it used to be:
One? you sit here (ground floor)
two? go downstair (basement)
other numbers upstair (any of the other floors)
glass table tops so the plates would slide across, generous portions and excellent prices.
Strangley enough, the Lido around the corner had exactly the same menu, but at about 25% higher prices. Thankfuly that is now gone.
For chinese clients, there used to be a chinese menu that had a number of items not available on the english menu. I am curious if that is still the case.",1
2,"This place is pretty awful. Although this restaurant is the cheapest in Chinatown it is very easy to see why. The staff are always rude and they shove you on a table full of strangers. When my friends had a birthday party there they even had the cheek to ask for some of the cake! Some of the plates were also dirty. The toilets were a pit and extremely unsanitary. I hear the place was originally closed for refurbishment because the council forced them to clean up their act. My advice is that if you do use Wong Kei, at least get a take away to avoid the poor service!",-1
4,The food here is no doubt good and worth the wait. The waiters are known to be rather rude but they've improved since the last I visited in December. The noodle and rice dishes are aromatic and tasty and you don't have to wait long to get a table!,1
4,"A really great chinese. the food is super cheap, but that doesn't mean it's low in qualityquite the opposite in fact! You can get all our favourites on the menu, and the waiters are really entertaining too.",1
5,"Ha Ha Ha, glad everyone else has had the same experience here! I went to London for the first time a couple of years ago and was taken here in the evening before a night out.
White tiled floor ceilings and walls everywhere,cash only, the staff are very surly and almost slammed my meal down in front of me, put on a table next to loads of strangers, I was really out of my comfort zone but enjoyed every minute. 
The food was great and really cheap, the real menu on the back looks really interesting, stir fried tripe anyone?
 Tried going back here for lunch the next day I liked it so much but ended up getting completely lost!",1
5,Yau Nam noodle soup... Thats all that needs to be said really. Just thinking about it has made me decide on where I am going for dinner tonight.,1
3,service wasn't bad as much as i heard. cheap chinese meal to have. generally not too bad.,-1
5,"Wong Kei Restaurant is one of my favourite dinner place. I dine at Wong Kei at least twice a week as it is cheap and authentic. Normally, I have eel rice and Chinese tea and it will be about £5.50. Sometimes if I feel like it I will order some fried choi sum and wanton soup. It is a chinese fast food. The service is quick and they will try to get you out as quickly as they can to get more customers. Apparently they earn their pay based on the number of customers the get each day, hence the hurry!",1
1,"No no no, how can this place be number 1? Okay so the food is pretty decent and the prices are low but IMHO the service out weighs all of that, The staff are the rudest for miles! They usually sit you with other people, plates and cutlery can be dirty, they give you your bill when you have one more bite to go, like a pre-emptive strike for you to leave. Other places like 1997 or crispy duck (on the same road) offer a similar service but at least with better standards. I would much rather pay the extra and eat there.",-1
5,"Definitely the best Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Huge portions, and dirty cheap. Food is tasty and served quicker than your average fast food chain.
 The whole 'expect abuse' thing is no more, and like all myths most seemt o want it to continue. Completely family friendly although you're likely to share a table with other guests. The chilli sauce is to die for.
 Good place for a quick feed, but if you're after a real 'dining experience' go elsewhere!",1
5,"It's really impressive how cheap and how good the food can be here, in the heart of Chinatown. The beef with chilli and black bean sauce is my personal classic and it's only £5! Seafood noodles can be as cheap as £3,80, the service is fast and they serve you jasmine tea for free - I find it perfect to help digestion after so much food. Portions are large! You might share your table with strangers and they are famous for the kinda rude service, but that's absolutely alright when you get the (cheap) bill.",1
4,"Love it. Simply, the most authentic Chinese food in Chinatown. A lot is written about the service in Wong Kei's, and its true it is amusing sometimes, but its not super rude. Its just fast and a bit brash. Have the chilli salted tofu, and some gailan (chinese brocolli). And the hot n sour soup",1
4,"A great place to have quick meal at great prices. I ordered a plate of stir friend noodles and a chinese tea drink for under £5. This is a fantastic price in central london. However, do not expect restaurant like service and be prepared to share a table with some other people.",1
1,"Once upon a time, this is a chinese restaurant famous for its poor (somewhat rude) service. After 10 years, I returned to this restaurant again, hoping to check out if the service and food quality has improved. I wasnt disappointed as the poor and rude service remain and the food is only average. Not my choice of restaurant and I would certainly not bring any friends there.",-1
5,Deservedly famous Chinatown restaurant. Food is basic and cheap and you sit at communal tables. Service is brusque but it's all part of the experience. The barbecued pork noodle soup is fantastic and great value for £3.50. You get free tea with your food which is lovely.,1
5,"Wonkey Wong Kei undoubtedly has a reputation for itself, whether it be good or bad, it's definitely a 'known suspect' in Chinatown. I've been here by myself loads of times, but I can't remember what food I ordered, or whether or not the food I did order was any good. The reason being, is that each and every time I've visited this canteen, some sort of commotion has taken place, which completely diverted my attention away from the food. And when I say commotion, boy do I mean COMMOTION.There are two notable occasions that stick in my mind. The first was this one time when I popped in on a beautiful summer's day, for a quick bite to eat. For those of you who haven't been there before, the downstairs street level is for single diners only. Groups of more than two, are seated upstairs in the sections that look more restauranty (carpet and wallpaper etc). But downstairs looks like a prison diner, a mess hall, a state school canteen kind of thing.So I was just sitting there, amongst an eclectic mix of diners (cabbies, minicabbies, students, oriental residents, workers from the nearby brothels, and this old aristocratic-like English lady who looked like miss Marple), when I heard a disturbance brewing at one of the neighbouring tables. There was some bickering going on between a customer and a waiter. So I turned to see what was going on. The customer was like a cockney type character, of slim build, in his 40's, about 5'9 with a demure 'The Sun' reader disposition about him. He may have been a cabbie. The waiter was a chubby, well-built stocky chap, in his twenties, who had short spikey hair and I think he was wearing glasses. So as I turned to figure out what all the fuss was about, I realized that it was regarding the dish that the customer had just received at his table. He started off in a friendly I didn't order this one, mate tone of voice, and the waiter contested with a firm yes you did kind of reply. It was a classic yes you did, no I didn't scenario, with each repetition increasing by a few decibels a pop, heading towards an almighty gut-wrenching crescendo. The cabbie character was adamant that he didn't order that dish. The dish in question was a 'duck fried rice'. Eventually, the waiter lost his cool, leaning over the customer, and with one sweeping karate chop hand gesture, sliced the air vertically down, right in front of the cabbie, and bellowed into his face, an ear splittingly coarse YOU ORDERED DUCK FLIED LICE!!!!!!!!!. Needless to say the whole restaurant went silent and turned to see the action. Miss marple started shaking her head in disapproval and I joined in with her, commenting on how rude I thought the waiter was, and how unnecessary his behaviour was. The poor cabby bloke was quaking in his boots, filled with fright, and shock, taken completely by surprise by the sheer audacity of this waiter's reaction. He just sat there cowering under the still airborne karate chop hand, which was still hovering around the poor guys face. Eventually, he came to his senses and managed to muster a bit of courage, replying to the waiter I don't need this s&%&! I'm not paying for it. I know what I ordered, and it weren't 'duck fried rice'!. And with that he stood up, still trembling from the combination of fright and embarrassment, and half heartedly managed to force a cocky swagger towards the front doors of the restaurant, turning around intermittently to issue a couple of 'f&$£ yous' to the waiter that had just ruined his day. How vulgar miss Marple said to me, as we both sat there in complete and utter disbelief.So that was one fond memory of Wong Kei. The second one I have of that place, is even more bizarre. It was one early evening, sort of like dinnerish time, when I was just passing by and couldn't help but pop in for a quick munch. So as usual I took position in the singles department, when I noticed a couple of giddy girls come in asking for a table for two. They were in their early twenties, sort of Essex secretary type girls, obviously having a little bit of a night out on the tiles. They seemed a little hammered. So they disappeared upstairs, and before I had time to place another mouthful of food into my mouth, another couple arrived, asking for the same deal. This time it was a couple of lads, both in their early twenties, basically the male version of what had just preceded them a few seconds ago. Two lads out on a bender. They too were ushered upstairs somewhere in the restaurant area. Then out of the blue, like say about ten minutes later or so, they all came flying down the chute, like human-laundry, one after the other, catapulted right out into the middle of the mess hall, all intertwined in some sort of brawl. They were fighting each other. It was the two lads vs the two ladies, if that's at all possible. There was screaming and shouting, ranting and raging, bodies flying here and there; it took me a while to figure out what the hell was going on. Basically, one of the lads was",1
3,"Fuel up and go
A great place to go if you are on a budget and also if you are very hungry ! The food is good and plentiful and complimentary jasmine tea is given (tip: when you want a refil leave the pot lid open and it will be efficiently re-filled). The drinks list is limited but reasonable priced. I've been going here for years and the service doesn't really change... it's quick and efficient but don't expect pleasantries. You don't get a choice of where you sit (either which level or table). Mostly you end up sharing one of the large circular tables with other diners. Taking this into account I have never had a bad experience here and it all adds up to a quirky dining experience. The decor is basic but varies from floor to floor, I think the best room is the first floor by the window if you are lucky enough to be told to go there !",-1
5,"I've eaten lots of tonkotsu, and this one is great! It's a 20 hour stock, so yes, it is fatty. I would eat here all the time if I lived nearby. Really hit the spot after a day of travel and jet lag from NYC.  
Friendly waiters, but it took a long time to order and pay the bill. Slow service seems to be the norm in Europe. 
The fried chicken wasn't like karaage, though it doesn't claim to be on the menu. We still enjoyed it with the sauce. The yuzu margarita paired great with the tonkotsu.",1
3,"My wife and I were in London as part of our London/Paris anniversary trip. We were craving some good asian cuisine, and she found this neat little Ramen shop. The ambiance is great. Rock n' Roll music and communal tables. We got seated at a couple of bar seats looking out the window. The menu was easy to read and we both opted for two ramens, a chicken kaarage appetizer and I ordered an Asahi Beer.
About 10-15 minutes later, other folks that arrived after us started getting food, and we had not even received our beer or water. So after telling the staff, we got our drinks 3-5 minutes later. Then the food arrived and I had specifically asked if there was bean sprouts. He wasn't sure, so I said, okay, if there is, please put it on the side. 
Guess what I got in my ramen when it arrived? That's right, bean sprouts.  The food itself wasn't bad. Decent broth, plenty of noodles and meat. A bit too oily for my own taste, but oil in broth is individual preference.
Then we wanted our check. I asked for it, and that alone took another 10 minutes. We waited and waited. I finally started to lose my patience and asked again, this time I told the waitress that we've had a pretty poor experience here. The manager came back with a fair discount and apologized for the experience. Apparently the original waiter was a trainee, which begs the question why wasn't he ""mentored"" by an experienced server. Anyways, the manager's response and sincerity saved this review from being a 1 star. I don't believe this is typical service, so I'd still recommend folks to try them out. Cheers!",-1
4,"I was in London for a few days and my coworker had recommended coming here, so we went for dinner. I probably wouldn't have found it if I were just wandering around.
My coworker had ordered the Padron Peppers for appetizer, which she shared. The peppers aren't spicy, but were flavorful. I think I ate quite a few.
I think I ordered the Garlic Tantamen ramen. There was so much meat in it! I thought it was a little too oily for my liking. The oily broth was a little too rich. Otherwise, the broth was good.
The server we had needed deodorant. That was the only other turn-off about this place.",1
3,"Having lived in New York, I've been spoiled for unlimited delicious ramen options and my personal opinion is that Bone Daddies is overhyped.
My friend and I came on a weekday night and there was a long line outside the shop. They took in pairs faster than groups, so my friend and I were seated after ten minutes. The inside of the shop is dim and crowded. There are only stool seats and seating is pretty tight. 
My friend and I got the Agedashi Tofu to start. This was pretty good! The portion was big and the tofu is silky with a light and crispy battered shell. The sauce was flavorful too. 
For ramen, I got the Tonkotsu and my friend got the Mushroom Ramen. What I liked most from the Tonkotsu ramen were the egg and the black garlic oil. However, everything else was a bit overwhelming. The pork broth was advertised to be simmered for 20 hours but it wasn't all that flavorful and definitely too oily. The ramen noodles were very thin and way overcooked so it was quite mushy to eat. I also got to try some broth from my friend's mushroom ramen and it was pretty good. 
Overall, Bone Daddies was a little disappointing and I'll be continuing my search for the best ramen in London.",-1
4,"Arriving in London and being sick really made me crave some hot broth. Also because I was traveling throughout Europe I was really craving Ramen. I looked up some Ramen restaurants and saw that Bone Daddies were spread throughout Central London and I was close to one. 
As I entered the restaurant it was packed with people and I thought this was a good sign of the food prepared inside. I went in solo and because of this I think I was sometimes forgotten as other tables were getting their food before mine. In the end... the result was that they actually forgot to put my order in the kitchen, however I was compensated with extra chashu meat in my ramen. 
The ramen broth did the trick and was very warming while I slurped the broth and dipped my noodles in it. The charting on the meat was also perfect as it gave an unique taste to the meat. The eggs were also boiled to a perfect runny Golden State which is usually a pivotal point of the ramen for me. Another good item that looked amazing is the Korean style ribs. Although I didn't order any the people next to me got them and they smelled and looked absolutely amazing.",1
2,Biggest rip off ever. Who is paying off reviewers like Lonely Planet to put this in their books? Two smallish (based on previous ramen experiences) bowls of ramen: 32 pounds. Mine had a wafer thin slice of pork belly and a small piece of crab. The kale? One small shred. The extra bok choi (for an additional 1.5 pounds over the 14 pound base price)was 2 small limp leaves delivered late. Really? For 1.5 pounds? On the upside the service was sweet but still not worth it. There is just as good ramen at better value elsewhere.,-1
5,"I'm guilty of not posting any review for Bone Daddies any sooner. I've been here many times and it's my go to Ramen place when I need a fix. I've been to this place since 2015. Bone Daddies has this really hip vibe, you'd think it's a cool bar but it's just really awesome how they made Ramen look cool. First of all, I've not been to a Ramen place that offers you bibs and hair ties (for ladies with long locks). That's really thoughtful. 
The area is smaller than most restaurants. There's usually a queue outside, but the wait is about 15-20mins depending how crowded it is. Its a little noisy, so it's probably not great for intimate conversations. The place is cramp, so you'll find yourself squeezed between people. It's generally not a place to bring babies or kids. Absolutely great for couples and if you're lucky, you might get an entire table for larger groups. 
I usually order the T22 Ramen with Chicken scratchings. It's probably one of my favourite. If you're not into pork all that much, there's that option for you. There are a bunch of vegetarian options as well. So you'll be glad to find a variety. Today however we decided to try something else on the menu:
1. Tonkotsu Ramen £11: Pork belly with Spring onions in 20 hours cooked pork broth
- If you're looking for an easy entrance and introduction to classic Ramen, this would be a good choice. It comes with two flavoured eggs and Bamboo shoots. I usually put in extra garlic and sesame crushed seeds to bump up the flavour. 
2. Curry Ramen £12: Spicy curry broth with deep fried chicken and jalapeño
- Anyone who likes chilli should try this bowl of fire. It tastes as spicy as it looks. Be prepared to have a cup of ice water ready. Also don't be surprise if you suffer the ""ring of fire"" the next day 
As with all good restaurants in London, there is usually a wait. But it's shaded and there's a heater outside. They work very quickly to try serve everyone their food. I've never been disappointed with their services and would definitely continue to come here.",1
3,"This ramen place used to be one of the best in London.  However, it has now been surpassed by Japanese branches especially Kanada-Ya.  I would say Ippudo is the second best.  Bone Daddies has a very hipster vibe in there where you can order sake and sit for a long time in there and no one would chase you away.  Whereas in a real ramen place, you are expected to eat and leave straight away.  The queue here used to be really long and I remembered queuing just to get in here.  
The noodle here is not up to my liking.  They are probably the thicker and they cooked it for too long so they are not springy enough.  The broth here is also diluted with no depth of flavour.  I won't be back unfortunately after I have found the other 2.",-1
4,"I had to try this place after being recommended by a bunch of ramen friends. What was that? You don't have ramen friends? How weird.
It's opposite the Supreme store, so you can watch people line up for hours to buy a shirt too, 
It was busy and loud - I don't mind that for lunch and was dining alone anyway. Seated quickly, the place gives off a slight hipster vibe. Condiments all looked to be in the standard style, the hair bands were an odd addition, but back in the rock hair phase they may have been useful!
I ordered:
Pork Bone ramen. Korean wings. Green tea and still water. 
The wings showed up quickly. They were well spiced and as sticky as you like. Not too small, just right for an appetiser I reckon. Between two as a light one maybe.
The main event arrived shortly after. 
The broth was great. Tasty and lightly spiced as expected. I added a little of the chilli and I was more than happy with its heat level. The pork was a little thicker than I would have expected, but that isn't a bad thing. Lots of top ramen content. 
My green tea never arrived but my server was more than happy to either bring it to me or remove it from the bill.
Overall I enjoyed it, I'll certainly be back. It's not Shoryu good, but it's really close.",1
4,"The rock -n- roll of ramen. If you want a hip spot that satisfies your craving for warm noodles, Bone Daddies is your cool friend. There is a good variety of ramen, from the spicy to more traditional, even curry and vegetarian options. It's also open late.
One thing I wasn't expecting was the amazing Brussel sprouts - yes Brussel sprouts! - side dish that was packed with fried green goodness, citrus and pomegranates. It's so much better than your generic edamame and sets them apart from many other ramen joints.
Get ready for a burst of flavour as the broth is quite thick, and their tonkatsu comes with a black garlic sesame oil which can be quite overpowering if you are looking for something more subtle. However if you are in the mood to rock, you will take comfort in this wild take on a Japanese classic.",1
3,"Pretty good for what you can find in London. The tonkotsu broth that they're known for is way too thick and more like a gravy. I'd opt for the other broths.  The line here does get quite long, so be sure to buffer some extra time. 
Protip: add the extra egg. It's totally worth it.",-1
2,"This place was hyped up and wasn't really good. The wait wasn't bad when it was busy. The staff are nice but the food wasn't that good. Its more like a ramen bar than anything else. The broth was mediocre but the noodles made up for it a bit. Overall, I wouldn't come here again as it left me wanting to eat something better. 
Pros: Fast, Service
Cons: Food
Stars: 2.5",-1
2,"This is for delivery: I've given this place a few chances, and now I'm done.  They advertise their tonkatsu as 20 hour pork bone broth that is ""A Bone Daddies Favorite: creamy white broth with Braised Tractor pork.""
The first time I  ordered tonkatsu, I got a brown insta-broth, I thought it was a mistake. I ordered it again, and it was brown again, and didn't have the tonkatsu taste.  It was oily and tasted like they just threw a pack of soup into hot water and grease, almost like a bad roux. I called them to ask if their tonkatsu was brown, and they confirmed, saying ""That's how we make it."" I've seen other reviews with the creamy white broth, so I don't know if they just send people who order delivery anything or what.
It's actually decent if you're craving ramen, but not the taste I was looking for. The minced pork is really good, and their chashu is delicious.  The noodles aren't my favorite. They seem to be soba noodles (buckwheat), but don't retain any of the flavors.",-1
3,"FOOD & DRINKS
We had TanTanMen (veggie & non veggie version) and the soft cocktail. The cocktail was very refreshing but the watermelon is a bit lost in the cocktail. If you were looking for a deep watermelon taste this might disappoint you. For me it was not amazing but pretty good.
I had veggie and non veggie ramen in London, Tokyo, Los Angeles, San Diego, Toronto... and I have to say that the ramen I had here are not in my top ten. They were good but it already started with the presentation. I couldn't see any love there. Even a ramen for 5 bucks in Tokyo sometimes had a better presentation than the bowl I had in front of me. As for the taste I had to say it was a tad to bitter for me. But that is just my own preference. I think the quality was ok and the meat was very tender. The egg was amazing!!
You also can add fresh garlic and a chili paste to your ramen. Top!
SERVICE
I think the staff were nice and attentive. Only can say good things about them and all of them look pretty cool. 
ATMOSPHERE
Well it is different from a japanese style ramen restaurant. I would describe it as hip or alternative which is also reflected by the staff working there and I absolutely love it. Why shouldn't a ramen shop not be cool, hip or just different? 
RATING
I think I would have given this restaurant a 4 if it had left a big impression on me since I already had ramen in other places in London. I must admit I like the ramen at other places more. Maybe next time I will try a different ramen and then the rating will be better!",-1
3,"Definitely not the best place for ramen in London but still pretty good. Wouldn't queue for it again as i find the broth too oily and the noodles too soft for my liking. 
Its opposite the Supreme store so don't be alarmed if when walking towards it you see a long line of people especially on thursday mornings, we almost left as we thought that was the queue for Bone Daddies!",-1
1,"How, HOW does Bone Daddies have such high ratings? Due to the number of great reviews this ramen joint has I decided to check it out for myself and I've only left in utter disappointment.  I tried the tonkotsu ramen during my first visit and the broth was pure NaCl.  It was so salty I couldn't finish my ramen which, trust me, has never happened before.  The soup here is honestly what I'd imagine the Dead Sea tastes like. Tonkotsu broth is often a creamy pale color but here it looks more like shoyu broth, perhaps they add a tub of soy sauce to it, rendering it completely inedible.  Besides the salt factor, it also doesn't have a nice pork flavor that is characteristic of quality tonkotsu ramen.  Lastly, I usually love nitamago which are seasoned soft boiled eggs but again here they're overly salty and not enjoyable.  They really need to tone it down a bit.
I thought my first experience was a fluke so I came back again to give Bone Daddies a chance to prove me wrong. This time I tried their tan tan men which was yet another letdown.  The broth left a powdery aftertaste and the noodles were beyond soggy.  
I hate to say this, but Bone Daddies is probably some of the worst ramen I've ever had.  Don't come here if you want anything remotely tasty or authentic.  Try Shoryu, Ippudo, or Kanada-ya instead if you're looking for something better in London.",-1
5,Love eating here whenever I happen to be in London. Have yet to try any ramen here but those bao sandwiches are amazing!,1
4,"Bone daddies one of the top ramen place in London?
Yes, I dare say. I still have a slight preference for Ippudo but Bone daddies is a close second plus it had more interesting choices in ramen combination.
We started with snacks: chicken wings which were simply yummy the right amount of sweet and spicy with a bit of a crunch.
Chashu pork and corn croquettes are abs fab a must order!!!! 
Now onto the ramen:
My friend went for the Prince of darkness. They warn you the it is f***ing spicy and it is. It s the kind of spice that creeps up on you (meaning its progressive) 
I went for the IP tonkotsu with an egg and it was just greatly balanced. The 20hours pork broth is just perfect but for me the noodles were a bit too large and too cooked but that s a personal choice. I like my ramen thin and al dente. Other than that the whole was just delish 
for the drinks we had the asahi cream head and the watermelon crush. Beer is beer obs but the watermelon crush was just the right amount of sourness and freshness I loved it, it goes perfectly with my dish as it was a little bit spicy so they married well.
Overall there is no doubt Bone daddies is one of the best places to get ramen in London!!!!",1
3,"I heard about Bone Daddies through a tantalizing photograph I found on reddit. When I first saw the pic I thought - ugh another delicious ramen picture from a traveller in Japan and was delighted that it was actually a spot in London. 
I got in around 6:30 and waited 5 minutes before we were seated. The service is quick and the food came out very quickly. My choice to order was easy as there is 1 vegetarian ramen on the menu. 
The ramen noodles were chewy but the thin kind that tend to get soggy quickly so slurp quickly! The vegetarian mushroom broth was pretty average. The flavour was one-dimensional and it was just a strong umami taste. No spice or creaminess that I've had in other vegetarian ramens. The toppings are perfectly cooked and the eggs yolks were golden and runny which was perfect. 
The overall experience was great and I understand why there was a long line-up of people waiting in the rain on a Monday night to get in. Didn't hit the spot on my ramen craving but I would recommend to non-vegetarians!",-1
3,"Bone daddies is a modern ramen joint.  Ramen meets hipster.  Edgy.  
To be fair, I didn't have much ramen in london to compare this too, perhaps this is the best London has to offer?  Perhaps it isn't.  Either way, the tonkotsu broth and the T22 are the 2 most raved about in reviews, so that is what we went with.  The broth itself was very thick and heavy, but somehow lacking depth in flavor.  The ramens themselves picture perfect!  
Everything was fresh and the staff was excellent.  The drinks were quite delicious as well.  
The stools aren't the most comfortable to sit on, but perhaps that is so people don't stay as long as the wait does get quite long.",-1
3,"I first heard about Bone Daddies when it was mentioned in a ""must try restaurants in London"" article. It raved about this place, saying it was the absolute best ramen joint around, so I was quite excited to try it. 
I asked for a recommendation and the waitress said their tonkatsu ramen was the most popular, so I decided to go with that. The service was speedy! I got my food in less than five minutes. However, I found the ramen to be very underwhelming. The broth had so little flavor - I felt like I was just drinking soupy oil. The ramen and meat were alright, but nothing to write home about. The egg was probably my favorite part of my meal. 
Perhaps because I've had really good ramen in Japan and Los Angeles before, Bone Daddies just wasn't up to par.",-1
4,"Ramen was pretty good.  
Would have liked the broth and roast pork to be warmer/hot.    Service a little lacking and unorganized.",1
3,"The best noddles I've ever had so far. The sevice was awful though, the starters arrived after the main course, the waitress didn't stop asking if we were finished, as if they wanted as to eat quickly to vacate the table. The place is extremely loud, and the loud music doesn't help. If you want a quick bite to eat this is the place, but if you want a nice relaxing dinner I don't recommend.",-1
3,"A friend recommended this place to us as one of the best ramen places in London. However, he did warn us that Asian food in London does not compare to that of the Bay Area. That said, I can say that this place is hit-or-miss. Some dishes are amazing and some are just bland. For example, I ordered the kimchee ramen while the others ordered the tonkatsu ramen. My ramen was bursting with flavor and good, but the tonkatsu was the opposite. The people in my group complained that it was one of the worst that they had ever tried. There was no seasoning at all. They had to add soy sauce or black oil to spice it up a bit. Disappointing. With the appetizers, order the fried chicken and skip the pork and corn croquettes. Again, one was perfect while the other one needed more. 
The restaurant is located close to Chinatown and I would have totally missed it if I walked by. The place is small so be prepared for a wait during meal times. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They had us come in from the rain and sit on stools until there was a table available. 
Remember that compared to almost every other currency in the world, the London pound is pretty expensive so don't expect this place to be cheap.",-1
3,"I had just eaten at Ippudo New York the week before, and Kanada-Ya in London a few days before eating here, so I feel like I had a pretty good base of comparison. I wanted to like this more, but I didn't care too much for the ramen here. I liked Ippudo and Kanada-Ya better.
This place didn't feel as authentically Japanese as Kanada-Ya did, and more of a fusion, cheeky-humor kind of place. I felt like I could be in a small ramen shop in Japan when I was at Kanada-Ya, but felt like I could be in SF or NY when I was inside Bone Daddies. This place is much more amenable for larger groups than Kanada-Ya. If you have more than 2 people, Kanada-Ya may not be a good fit, but I think Bone Daddies would be able to accommodate parties of 4-6, but not much larger. The wait is probably much shorter too.
I ordered the Tantanmen which has sesame, chili, minced pork, chashu pork and bok choy. The broth was rich and flavorful, but I preferred the broth at Ippudo NY and Kanada-Ya better. The pork here was a bit on the dry side which was disappointing - it needed a bit more fat in it. Normally, I have no problem polishing off a bowl of ramen, but I didn't finish this one. Noodles were fine, but I preferred the chewier / more al-dente noodles at Katana-Ya.
Korean Fried Chicken Wings - These were huge, and had almost too much sauce on them. I didn't find them really crispy on the outside, probably because there was too much sauce on them. I don't think I'd get these again.
If you're looking for ramen and want more options on flavors and more unique combinations / fusion, then this place is great. It's also good for slightly larger groups and/or if you want to have drinks with your meal. If you want a more authentic ramen experience, head over to Katana-Ya.",-1
4,Really love chicken wings!!! And sadly I was so devoted chatting with friends my noodles doesn't taste well... :),1
2,"- Main issue for me is that the broth was way too thick, like a gravy
~ Fairly loud, dive bar-esque atmosphere
~ Note that the Prince of Darkness is super spicy",-1
4,Came here for a team dinner when we were visiting from the states and the food was really good. They were able to seat our large party all together and serve us quickly. They have food options for vegetarians and can also accommodate other dietary restrictions.,1
4,"Waking up from an evening of seeing London's bars and clubs with some friends, two of us looked at each other and said Japanese food.  I had bookmarked this place from the last time I was in London and didn't make it here.  Weekend lunch crowd equaled a short wait for the 4 of us, but we took the time to look over the menu and enjoy the ambiance.  
One of us was skeptical because he is a true Ramen Nerd, in the end he felt content, not overjoyed, but satisfied. I had the T22 with extra noodles and that was pretty good, enough soup and ingredients to cover the extra noodles, the broth was flavorful, not intense.  It wasn't the mind-blowing experience others would say, but I thought it was pretty good.  I might stop by again next time I am in town, but than again there are a lot of good restaurants in London and SOHO.",1
3,"Good ramen but a little overrated. Got the Yuzu Tonkatsu ramen, the fried chicken and the chashu pork and corn croquettes. The croquettes were delicious but the fried chicken was a bit dry. The ramen had a nice broth but it wasn't as flavorful as other ramen places in the area. The pork belly was nicely cooked however and the it had a nice mild kick to it. Overall good ramen but not worth the long waits at peak meal times.",-1
5,"Another tough competitor at the best ramen in London. If you like a thick ramen, you'll love the Tonkotsu variations that Bone Daddies has to offer. 
This was my second ramen of the weekend after having just been to Toro for Tonkotsu Ramen just yesterday (I'm a ramen addict!), but this time I'm trying a new type of ramen, Kani Tonkotsu. This ramen has chashu pork, softshell crab, chilli, kale, beansprouts and black sesame. Alongside a Bone Daddies Cider. The ramen was good, very very good, it was hot and a nice refreshing change from the normal Tonkotsu that I'm always eating. Highly recommended! 
I had Green Tea, Coconut and Salted Caramel Frozen Mochi for dessert. Normally I'm not a fan of frozen mochi but these flavours were delicious. 
Please, please go check out this Ramen as it is one of the best in London!",1
3,Tried the tonkotsu ramen and the broth tastes really thick. But it may tastes a little bland for some people. Personally didn't think the noodles tasted as good either. The restaurant itself may be ano good place to come with friends and hangouts.,-1
3,"I have to agree to some other Yelpers reviews here, it has a very hipster vibe. Even I am into Punk Rock / Rock N Roll and love a good Izakaya, this place is way to loud. It was hard to talk to each other and even the waitress had a hard time understanding our order. 
The menu was super hard to read, the font was micro sized printed on brown paper in a very dimmed light. The ramen was ok, the broth was very diluted with no depth or flavor. The waitress also forgot some things we ordered, but it was on the bill anyway. So we had to let them know that we wont pay for items that we didn't get, which was acknowledged, but not excused in any kind of way.
As a bar/pub hang out with a twist, its kinda ok-ish, but there are better places for that in Soho. I had the most amazing ramen in Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing. This place wont be ending up on my top ramen list.",-1
4,"I've visited Bone Daddies countless times in the past three years, and I still love it just as much as I did the first time.  I will admit that there have been a few times where I felt the quality of the ramen dropped slightly, but overall it's quite consistent.  I also stand by the fact that their fried chicken is still one of my favourite fried chicken dishes in London!",1
3,"Tried both the tonkatsu and t22 and really not that impressed. Their broth had a weird spice in it with a strange taste. Not that authentic compared to ramen I've had in Japan and in New York. Softshell crab was also passable. Pork croquettes were the only highlight of the night and were worth getting. I'd recommend going to Shoryu a couple blocks away if you want a better ramen experience. The wait time is about the same for both places, about 15-20 minutes for you to get seated. Shoryu has more of an Asian crowd whereas bone daddies has more of a hipster crowd with asian fusion style to it.",-1
3,"Good ramen. Has a nice spice to it and plenty of broth.
Service could use some work. They had us wait for 30 minutes, I got up and asked what was going in, then they informed me there was a mix up in the kitchen and our order was coming soon.
If someone had proactively said this, I would deal with it.. but I saw 3 people that got there after we ordered get their food, so they had plenty of time to let us know. The whole thing just soured the experience.
The manager compd our appetizer which was nice, but I didn't like that no one bothered to acknowledge the screw up before I had to go and ask.
I might give this place another try, but not if they are too busy.",-1
4,"Woah this was good. My friend ordered the kimchee ramen and I had already bought a veggie pot pie so I didn't order anything. This place was packed and I could see why. The ramen was the bomb! Not salty, not oily, not bland, not cheap on ingredients. All was great about this dish and it was not expensive either. The waiter was friendly and the customers had so much energy. You won't feel lonely here if you are a solo traveler.",1
4,"Decided to check out the ramen scene in London, this one in particular given that it was one of the higher rated places.
Arrived around 7pm on a Thursday, there was a short lineup but people come and go quickly and we were in after about 15-20 min of waiting. It's more of a ramen bar than a nice sit down place. Very loud and lively, the locals seem to love it.
The staff were not that friendly imo. It wasn't very clear that we were supposed to wait by the wall once entering. We thought we had a spot already because it looked like they were gesturing us to follow the group in front of us. That was awkward. While seated, the waitress ran into my bf while walking through the aisle and didn't even say sorry, just asked him to tuck in his chair when it wasn't even his fault. No smiles given. It's definitely a little crammed in there. 
Anyways, the food. We didn't get any apps or drinks, just the tonkotsu and T22 ramen. The food came reasonably quick, around 10-15min wait. Tonkotsu had very standard ramen broth, on par with Ippudo in NYC. I thought I'd try the T22 because I don't have chicken ramen very often. It was delicious - and there are cock scratchings which added crunch. The broth got a bit salty after awhile though. They use thin noodles which I loved. Overall, very filling and moderately priced.
3/5 for service and 4.5/5 for the food.",1
3,"I also heard about this place from friends, so I decided to venture over here for a warm bowl of ramen. First impressions, I liked how they have garlic ready on the table with a garlic masher, BIBS if you're a messy eater (I am sure am!), hot sauce, and lots of utensils already ready. The garlic is in a jar, but I love garlic in my ramen so I was very happy. 
I ordered the T22 ramen and I was a little dissapointed. The broth was not as rich as I liked and it was spicy. I'm not a spicy food fan so that was an immediate no-no for me. The noddles were also incredibly hard and it tasted almost undercooked. The meat was also not very tender. The mushrooms were good tho. However, they do give you TWO halves of a soft-boiled egg unlike a lot of other ramen restuarants and they have a very impressive drink menu. I wouldn't say this would be a go-to ramen place for me, but it was enjoyable for such a cold winter day.",-1
1,"Couldn't be more disappointed. 
They ran out of all good sake and we were told that the house 'would be fine'... not sure we were looking for fine... 
Then I ordered more noodles and waited 15 for them to arrive before they arrived and my broth was cold.",-1
4,"Bone Daddies was always going to be a hit with me. It has two things I absolutely love, ramen and rock. This Peter street outlet is where it all started...as a simple ramen bar. The interior has Japanese inspired graphics, and pictures of Japanese rockers plastered all over the walls. Diners are seated on stools at high tables. The rest of the Bone Daddies experience comes courtesy of an all-out onslaught on the senses, the noise, the smells, the tastes - fantastic.
To start, we ordered the Salmon Tartar, Wild Soft Shell Crab, and Edamame. I regret not ordering the Korean Fried Chicken Wings which, the couple sharing our high-table so thoroughly seemed to have enjoyed. Our salmon, which is served with a lime wasabi ponzu, was really good; the salmon so fresh I could swear it had a pulse. The soft-shelled crabs come with an out-of-this-world Thai green curry, chilli and ginger sauce - OMG!
For our mains, we ordered the oddly named T22, which is a soy ramen, a Kimchee Ramen and my favourite, Spicy Miso Ramen - all amazing; my spicy miso ramen as good as any I have had in Tokyo (and believe me I have had a lot). The noodles are not just genuine ramen noodles but they were cooked perfectly.
Service is good for London, and it's fast; they're just too busy to be friendly. Expect to stand in a queue, either in-doors or out, for up to 15-minutes. I'm not sure if they accept reservations. I think not. Irrespective, if you're looking for an authentic ramen in London, this is the place to come.
Waste NOT. Want NOT.",1
3,I am honestly only giving it 3 stars because there was a hair in my food. I ordered the curry ramen which contains fried chicken. I noticed there was a hair so I was just gonna pick it out and when I did I realized it was fried in to the chicken. It was so disturbing that I couldn't really eat my food. And when I told my server he looked at me blankly and then walked away only to come back and say their chef was sorry. Still charged me for my ramen.... it's just frustrating when you don't make a huge fuss they don't comp your ramen.,-1
5,"Bussssssssssssiiiiii ! 
This place was packed! Not just packed it is packed paxked ! The queue is extended to outside of the door.
Credit to the ramen really!!!! Springy and hearty! And the broth was soooupppper nice and dense and the ingredients, the braided slice pork and the slightly runny eggs were perfect match with the broth and ramen ! 
They also have this bib thing where you can wear to prevent the juiciness of the ramen spread on your coat. Gimmick ! 
Overall nice food and hipster-y environment",1
4,"Delicious ramen, fast service, but one of the waiters was in such a hurry he pushed my partner and I around a little. Would definitely come back.",1
5,"Great Ramen house in the heart of SOHO. Very close to the gay district and in walking distance to the shopping areas. When we arrived a line was forming out the door. Waited for about 15-20 minutes before being seated. I don't think they take reservations at this location and from the looks of the que, seems like a local favorite. 
Of course I ordered the Miso Ramen. It was actually quite different from what i'm use too. The soup base almost reminded me of a tex-mex kind of fusion with the traditional miso ramen. It was different but delicious! Ramen noodles cooked perfectly, and pork was cooked just enough to keep a firm texture. Waiters were very friendly and understood people were waiting long for food so extra smiles and attention was given. Would definitely recommend this location for tasty Ramen. Tuna tartar was amazing as well! Freshly prepared and uniquely set for a fun and memorable experience.",1
4,"I love ramen! So, I'm always looking for a great ramen house. Bone Daddies is not your typical ramen house. They add their own special touches/spins to traditional ramen. We tried the Tatanmen and the tonkatsu. These weren't really your typical tatanmen or tonkatsu broths. I can't quiet put my tongue to it, but it's got its own special kick! The noodles were decently chewy and in good amounts. The garnishes aren't that special. I think what makes Bone Daddies special is their broth! Oh and their drinks! Mr. Sparkle and BD Rocket! I will be returning for those!
The decor is unique - modern yet edgy. The place is always packed. There's going to be a line. Prepare for some tight seating and maybe even eating with strangers. But really, it's not that bad! You're there for the food anyways!",1
2,"Was looking forward to this because I was having some serious craving for a good ramen in London. 
The broth was thick, egg yolk was flowy and good; but something just didn't quite make the cut. 
I would say, the majority of flavor I was getting, was the taste of noodles. That starchy taste. The soup wasn't as flavorful, the meat wasn't mouth-watering. 
A little disappointed because I saw great reviews on this. 
Perhaps I just gotten a bad bowl. Will look to try shoryu ramen next tho.",-1
2,"Disappointing ramen experience here, far below par. Spicy tonkotsu doesn't even come with an egg (or was forgotten). The broth was cold and there was hardly any in the bowl, so we had to push down on the noodles and toppings to get any onto the spoon.",-1
3,"Maybe I'm spoiled for choice in NYC with ramen joints, but Bone Daddies really just did not do it for me.  I got the classic Tonkotsu Ramen, and didn't enjoy it enough to finish (and trust me - I eat a LOT).  The broth was nice and thick, but lacked flavor, and the texture of the noodle wasn't as chewy as I would have liked.
They did have this awesome brussel sprout appetizer though - the pomegranate seeds added a great kick to it, so an extra star for that!  I would go if you're looking for a quick meal but nothing worth going out of your way for.",-1
5,"Fantastic ramen. I'm far from the first person to figure out Bone Daddies knows what's up, but I've now been twice, and each time I've been impressed. I decided to try to curry ramen with fried chicken - amazing. They had some appetizers that looked delicious as well, but with a big bowl of ramen, your stomach will be full, so one course is really all you need, unless you have a few people to share something with. 
We got there at 7:30pm (on a Monday) and probably waited 15 minutes to get seated. Once in our seats, we didn't have to wait long to order though, and the food came pretty promptly. I'm excited to try some other ramen places in London, but Bone Daddies did a pretty good job of setting the bar. We'll see if anything else comes close.",1
4,"Bone Daddies is definitely a great ramen place to check out in London. Went with two other friends and we ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, Kimchee Ramen, & Dipping Ramen to share among us three.
1. Tonkotsu Ramen was on the saltier side. Definitely good, but nothing particularly outstanding in terms of how tonkotsu ramen broth. The noodles were a very good level of not too hard and not too soft. I definitely enjoyed the noodles, and was a bit let down with the broth. It was simply just salty and nothing particularly flavorful. Nevertheless, it was wonderful with a cup of water on the side.
2. Kimchee Ramen was super spicy. You need a strong ability to handle spiciness to take on this broth. It came with a lot of seafood which was wonderful and very fresh. As someone who personally cannot handle anything too spicy, this was definitely something not in my zone of comfort. However, my friends who love anything super spicy were really happy with the flavor of the broth.
3. Dipping Ramen was a very unique experience where all the ramen ingredients came on a platter next to a cup of sauce. The sauce appeared clear but was extremely flavorful. I personally really enjoyed this dish because it was not only a unique ramen experience, but also something well-flavored and worth the price!
ADVICE: Arrive at an early dinnertime! There will be a line! The line will most likely be outdoors so bring a nice coat to wear. There will be hooks on the wall inside of the restaurant, so you can hang up your coat when you're seated.",1
4,"Not much more can be said that hasn't been already about the ramen kings, bone daddies! 
Arrived just after 6 on a Thursday, and pretty soon there was a queue out the door, as expected! 
My friend and I nabbed seats by the front window (excellent people watching while dining) and stared with an order of the Korean chicken wings; they had a sweet and spicy sauce and were crispy and delicious!! But messy, soooo messy! 
We both had the tonkatsu ramen with the now famous pork bone broth. Rich, creamy and flavoursome, loaded with noodles, spring onion and a perfectly soft poached egg- ramen perfection! I did add a load of chilli to mine, so think next time I'll order the spicy version and see how I get on!
We ended our meal with a selection of moochi ice creams. The green tea was good but slightly bitter, the raspberry fresh and fruity and the chocolate has a rich, mousse like quality to it. 
Staff were friendly and the atmosphere was buzzing - yet another great spot in soho!",1
5,"I finally got my ramen fix after craving it for a while ever since I started watching a Japanese Netflix TV show called ""Good Morning Call' (totally hooked on this show). I liked the sound of this place as it was casual dining and has received great reviews. 
At 4pm, it was not very busy so my husband and I decided to take the seats near the window gazing out on to the street. I was glad we had the room around our seats as it created a little privacy . The only downside to this was having to turn around to talk to the server, but that was no big deal. 
I liked so many things; the little jar of elastic hair bands, bibs, fresh ginger with press, the music and most of all, that there's no shame in slurping.
We had the fried chicken, which was served piping hot. It came with a lemon wedge, but we preferred a dipping sauce and found the soy sauce, which was good. I then had the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra egg, corn and chicken cock scratchings. Now I was unsure about the latter, but the waitress explained it's a nice crunchy garnish, which it certainly was. After my meal, I was nicely full and glad it wasn't raining as I totally needed to walk off the ramen.  I can't wait to go back to try the other dishes.",1
2,"I have been to Japan and while I know good ramen, I am not super picky. 
When you first walk in, you will notice it is super dark. You can't read the menu if you are seated in the corner. From a distance, I thought the place was closed.
I ordered the IP Tonkatsu ramen. It came looking nice but I notice black spots on the ramen , as soon as I stirred, it turned the whole broth deep brown. This was not the color of ramen that I wanted nor is expected. It should be a creamy oily white broth.
After a few bites, I couldn't eat anymore. It tasted overwhelmingly like soy sauce. There are soy flavor ramens but this was just too strong of soy sauce. 
I thought ok, let me order another ramen and maybe it was just a one off. I showed a picture of what I wanted and they said it was spicy miso.
The spicy miso appeared nothing like the photo I pointed to the waitress. All the ingredients were the same yes but again the color of the broth was wrong. It was a pale red dull color. The taste was better than the tonkatsu but still not what I wanted.
I basically ordered two ramens, ate half of one and paid £30. Oh guess what, they also tack on service charge 12% and force you to donate £1 to charity in your bill.
The worst experience I've had in London so far. 
The two stars is for the fact that the ingredients themselves were very good. The noodles were not typical ramen firmness or cut but were still very delectable. The corn is from a grilled cob and sliced off in small stacks. The egg is soft boiled but might have had too much soy flavor or that was due to my broth I'm not sure.
The service in general was nice but they should have known better or tried to accommodate me in some way when they knew I didn't like any ramen even after ordering two. I'm not asking for free food but it would have been nice if they at least asked if I enjoyed the food after I said I didn't enjoy the first ramen. I think that means they don't genuinely care and just want your money.
Watch out.",-1
4,"Good location and we were seated right away on a Sunday afternoon. The food was quite good, I had the salmon poke and I really enjoyed it for £10. It has a nice atmosphere and I would definitely go back.",1
5,"I really wanted to give this place 4 stars instead of 5, because I despise crowded places, stools, small table space and queues, and this Bone Daddies has all of the above. 
That said, as soon as I've put food in my mouth I went to ramen heaven and back, and as my friend pointed out, I didn't say a word for 20 minutes. 
I've ordered the Tonkatsu (Tonkotsu? Tonk...whatever) ramen, and added the cock scratching because in all the pictures I saw of ramen from Bone Daddies I could spot these crispy bits on top and really wanted to know what they were and try them. 
OH. MY. SWEET. BABY. DAY. IN. THE. LIFE. 
Can I just go back there RIGHT NOW?
The 20h pork broth was so rich and creamy, it would have been delicious on its own. Like, even without the perfectly sliced thin pork, the flavourful noodles, the hard-boiled eggs that kept a soft but not runny yolk, the soy sauce on the one side of the bowl, the spring onions, and all the other bits, including the scratching. Which were out of this world delicious. 
I would love to say something more about the place itself, the hairband and bib they provide for mess-free experience, the atmosphere, etc. But I have a parade of ramen soups dancing in front of my eyes and can't think of anything else but going back there asap. 
So if you're anything like me (i.e. a fussy introverted mess) you'll want to run away when you see the crowd, PLEASE BE PATIENT BECAUSE IT'S WORTH IT. I promise. 
(Ps. Thank you Charlotte K. for being to me that one friend to take me here, as someone else did with you years ago. Let's keep the tradition going eh?)",1
4,"Environment: casual and noisy, not in a bad way but don't expect privacy. You're going to sit with other people at the same table. Expect some waiting time, around 20 mins in average. 
Food: great stuff. Probably the best ramen I've had so far. I even had friends from the US with previous ramen experience express the same view. It's a huge bowl filed with broth noodles and whatever other ingredient you order.",1
3,"Ambiance is nice, definitely a good spot for late night bite (but not too late they close at 10 p.m.). The place gives off very hipster vibes.
I actually really enjoyed their Salmon Tartar with the Lime Wasabi Ponzu and it came with Renkon Chips! The salmon was definitely fresh and the ponzu was amazing with the salmon, it's bright, citrusy, and a nice kick of wasabi! Actually one of the best things I've had! I really liked what they did with the sauce for the salmon. 
I had the Tonkotsu Ramen and it was okay. It definitely is one of the better ramen places that I've visited in London, but the ramen itself was still a little lackluster in general. The broth was fine, it's actually a little less salty than other places which I liked. The broth is also very creamy. The ramen egg was really nice, but the menma (bamboo shoots) were quite awful...lots of unchewable strands of bamboo shoots! There were hard and hay like strands in my bamboo shoots and toppings. The noodles were quite bad though, it was mushy for me. Perhaps it was just that night or my ramen had been sitting out for a while, because ramen noodles should never be mushy! Mine had no bounce whatsoever (it was also quite thin), very limp, and it was just overall unpleasant to eat in general. Not quite consistent with what I've heard about their ramen, but that was what I had. LIMP NOODLE!!!
I had the Gini Hendrix cocktail as well and I highly recommend the drink! It's like a Gin and Tonic but much more refreshing and bright! Love the addition of cucumbers and yuzu liquor instead of tonic, so refreshing and much more complex. Oolong syrup didn't really add a tea taste to it, but it was a very sweet drink. Probably my favourite cocktail ever!
It's a great place to meet up with others and have a decent meal, but it is actually quite dark inside. Prices are also pretty steep for food.",-1
4,"I came here on a bank holiday around 5:30 and managed to get a seat right away with my mom. But we got lucky because I don't think anyone was seated long after that and there was a huge lineup outside. 
I got the curry ramen. I thought it was pretty good. The fried chicken managed to stay crispy and the broth had really good flavour so I didn't have to add anything to it. I also was sceptical about the noodles since some of the reviews weren't so great but I thought they were fine. They were ramen noodles! Didn't find them chewy, hard, soft or too big. The peppers were interesting and didn't do much for the dish in my opinion 
My mom got the tantanmen ramen. The soup was a little peanuty and she thought she didn't get enough meat, but other than that it was good
We were sitting right at the window and since there was a line up people were constantly watching us eating which was a little weird for me but, can't really blame the restaurant though.
There were some other ramen that I wanted to try so I would go back 
I didn't take pictures as it was quite dimly lit and they wouldn't have turned out
Shoutout for the great service though! Even though it was crazy busy the servers made sure to come over to us every so often to check up on things and managed the line well",1
3,"As far as London food goes, I can see why this place is hyped. It has enough uniqueness going for it, and Asian foods are trending pretty hard right now. But as far as Japanese food goes in particular, I'm a snob and very much an isolationist. I want my dishes simple and authentic. Not a huge fusion fan either. And I want my tastebuds to feel the sensation of being transported to the land of the rising sun. 
With that disclaimer out there, if you want an original experience, sure, hit up Bone Daddies. But if you want an authentic experience, you won't get that here. This is big-time, hipster noodle fare.
- The noodles are frozen. You can't customize the consistency and they cook them pretty soft here (firm should be the standard). They're also crimpy to the max. T_T
- They don't serve rice. At all. No rice. Zero.
- Tea is from a packet.
- They don't have togarashi. Seriously? 
- No vinegar either.
- The broths are not so much flavorful as they are intensely spicy. If spicy broth is your thing, then by all means, jet on over here for some indulgence. But I prefer rich and full broths.
The milky / creamy broth in the tantanmen was very interesting. I've never had it like this before. Or with peanuts. Or with chashu. But with very little ground meat in the first place. Hmmm. I ordered it without the extra chilies and it still had a crazy bite to it. The tantanmen 2 is even moreso, veryvery spicy.
I'll end this on some positives. 
+ Their karaage is good as far as fried chicken goes, but no need to go crazy for it, guys. 
+ Kudos on offering black sesame and kinako flavours for dessert, but those dishes were too diluted for one to truly appreciate such unique tastes. Less subtle, more concentrated, please.
+ Fresh garlic!
+ Their bamboo had a good crunch and their eggs are cooked perfectly.
+ Hilarious bibs on request, haha.",-1
5,"Excellent ramen. Excellent atmosphere. Excellent mochi ice cream.
The ramen is deeply flavorful with unique toppings like ""cock scratchings"" which is crushed fried chicken skins. The atmosphere is hip and trendy, with tight quarters, communal seating, and no reservations. The service is quick and kind. Top it all off with excellent mochi, a Japanese dessert that are tasty balls filled with ice cream.
I was a tourist and this was the best meal of my trip.",1
3,"Good service, long lines but moved quite fast thanks to staff efficiency. They gave us complimentary warm sake shots while waiting in line. Ordered yuzu tonkotsu. Quite tasty; the broth is a bit too thick for my taste but some people may prefer it. Noodles were ok, a bit skimpy on the meat but satisfying overall. Chili sauce was more Chinese style than Japanese. It was fine but a bit of an ecclectic mix if you're expecting a Japanese ramen shop. Soft shell crab apps was very tasty & fresh; though the accompanying dipping sauce was quite odd & not a really good pairing. Agedashi tofu was quite disappointing. 
May return but probably will try the chicken broth ramen instead and the chicken wings app (they look quite appetizing).",-1
4,"Came here while roaming London on my own. It's tucked away in Soho and quiet a gem. I walked in and found that it was very busy. I'm not sure if it was due to the rain outside or if it was always like this. Luckily, since I was by myself, I was seated immediately.
After much debate, I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen. The ramen is in a very rich chicken bone broth. The broth had a padron pepper floating in it, and complimented the pork neck chasu. I've had my fair share of ramen and I really loved this ramen. I found that although it was spicy (just the way I like it), the broth was just a teensy bit sweet. Not sure if that was due to the Miso? This did not bother me though. The pork and spiciness of the broth offset that sweetness and it was very well balanced. I'd love to try the tantanmen ramen the next time I am here though!",1
3,"Yes the pork broth is tasty but this place is just that bit too pretentious for me.
I asked for a side of kimchi even after being assured it would be on the side they threw it into my soup. This coupled with loud music and too cool for school waiters - there is better ramen in London.",-1
4,"Top-shelf ramen with great flavor in the broth and tender noodles as well as a diverse selection of toppings to be added a la carte or at the table. I am told by friends that I made a big mistake here by not ordering the Korean chicken wings or the fried chicken, although the salmon tartare with crispy lotus root chips and a ponzu oil flavoring was dynamite as well. I would definitely go back, although I would make sure to try the chicken next time.",1
2,"I... 
I honestly don't get it. 
After visiting bone daddies last week,  the high praise is pretty startling to me. I absolutely love ramen, and though I've spent a few months in Japan eating tons of it,  I'm no snob. I've slurped my fair share of 89cent pre-packaged block ramen and know that hey-- there's a spectrum. 
From what I'd read from others regarding ramen in London,  they don't really come close to the authentic fare,  but are still incredibly delicious. So when I saw that bone daddies was super hyped here and other places online,  I was actually really excited (despite the overwhelmingly hipster vibes). In the end,  I left disappointed. 
I had the tonkotsu ramen, hyped for a punch of that 20 hour deep, rich porky flavor, but instead I got an over salty (and trust me,  I loves me some salt) bowl of mediocrity. I can't speak for any of the other dishes,  but really... Even the crazy blaring music wasn't enough to distract me from how lacking in any depth of flavor this was. Like some basic stock and noodles. It was nothing special, so for the price, I didn't feel I'd gotten my money's worth. I've still yet to try some of the other recommended ramen places in London,  but as of now,  I definitely opulent rush back to bone daddies. 
Two stars because the egg was perfectly cooked,  edamame delicious,  and asahi flowin'.",-1
3,"We decided to try something less formal today so we went to Bone Daddies for some Ramen.  Lining up seems to be the new trend in London.  
Tomato salad with their Japanese sour vinegar dressing was delicious. We had Tonkatsu ramen and Kimchi ramen.  The  soup base was made with pork broth that has been cooked for 20 hours, so imagine the flavour and thickness of the soup.  
However, there is one thing interesting, I tasted ginger in the soup which is not the normal ingredients of Tonkatsu ramen.  I prefer the regular ones though.  
The seating is not amongst the most comfortable ones, and I preferred to just stand there eating than sit on those wooden stools.",-1
4,"This is one of the best ramen places I've ever been to. I got tantanmen 2, a dish that promised a little spice, and it absolutely delivered. I've been having a hard time finding dishes that are actually spicy in the UK, so I was beyond excited to find one that was. Aside from that, the flavor was amazing. Just thinking about it now I'm craving it. It was perfectly creamy and spicy, and there was just the right amount of chicken. I loved my dish, but it was huge and I couldn't finish it, and I was leaving on a plane so I couldn't take it go to. I wish there were smaller portions. Also, I do prefer to not eat meat when I can, but the only broth they had was mushroom, which I'm allergic to, so it would be nice if they could get more vegetable broths. The service was also really weak despite there being 5 people working. They stood around and talked a lot and seemed kind of irritated to be asked for water or for the check. However, the food itself was so good that the rating deserves to be high. Definitely recommend this place even with the service not being the best!",1
4,"T22 is perfect on a cold day when you haven't eaten anything all day and feel a bit depressed... in another word, this ramen is a perfect comfort food for the soul!  The service is attentive and all smile even thought it was a bit late.",1
4,"+ Perfect soft-boiled egg
+ Full-bodied flavor of the soup
+ Nice appetizers (try the spareribs, YUM!)
+ Great touch with readily available hair ties to hold back the hair when working on the ramen!
+ Hooks on the wall for purses and jackets!
- The seating.. not a fan of bar stools.. need that back support
- A bit on the pricey side for a bowl of ramen.. but I guess this holds true for all areas with not a big Japanese population",1
5,"So, I went to Japan for a week, and stayed in Sapporo, on the island of Hokkaido. I ate a lot of ramen there.
Then I came home and met a friend for lunch at Bone Daddie's. I didn't even know what kind of food they were going to serve until I got there. I thought to myself ""oh no, here we go, the last thing I need after a week in Japan is some hipster place pretending to be a ramen restaurant"" but I hadn't seen my friend for a while and she has good taste so I didn't kick up a fuss.
And I would have been really embarassed if I had kicked up a fuss, because this place is great!
The ramen is really authentic, just like the stuff you'd get back in Japan. In many ways better because they have pork-free broth for those who are sensitive to it.
For the price they charge, you get a tasty bowl of soup, with good noodles.
It's just a shame everyone else in the world seems to know this and there's always a queue to get in!",1
4,"Confession: it's controversial, but I don't think I really like ramen. I've tried supposedly good places in the past and not been impressed so thought I'd give it one last crack at the grand daddy. Bone Daddies was actually great. I don't think I'm a convert but it was definitely good, super tasty! If you're a ramen lover you'll like it!",1
4,"How have I not reviewed Bone Daddies yet?
As a vegetarian this is my go-to ramen stop, offering an alternative to the predictable miso broths. 
Bone Daddies often has a queue, in my experience Sunday lunch time is the best time to avoid this. Music is a little loud, and the high-stall seating doesn't make me feel so inclined to stay here all evening. Bone Daddies will always be a bit of an in and out affair for me. 
The uname-rich vegetarian mushroom broth at Bone Daddies is a solid veggie alternative to the traditionally meaty tonkotsu. At around £10, the price is a little steep, but this is Soho. The mushrooms in this broth are delicious, though on my last visit I got only three pieces of tofu. Inconsistent but delicious.",1
4,"PROS - Absolutely loved the rambunctious music upon entering. I mean, what do you expect from such an awesome restaurant name, ""Bone Daddies""? Very straightforward menu with great descriptions. I'm always a sucker for Tonkotsu based soups so of course I got that and it tasted dreamy. My friends got the Spicy Miso (lots of flavor, almost overwhelming but in a good way) and the T22 (a chicken broth based soup, he got it because it said ""cock shavings"" haha but my Tonkotsu still had more flavor than the T22). 
Hopefully the hair ties don't get reused but that is hilarious touch. I also dig their bathrooms. 
The ramen is solid, but could have been more generous with the noodles and broth (or maybe I'm just a piggy). I would like to try their chicken karrage next time as well. 
CONS - None really, I need to update this review once I try the neighboring competitor, Shoryu. ;)",1
5,I used to go Bone daddies regularly. I don't any more because my partner and I we pretty much foodie on the run and have this mission not to go the same restaurant again within a short period of time. But I have to say bone daddies does the best soup (?) I believe. Ramen king!,1
2,"Tonkatsu Ramen broth has been pretty salty the last two times that I've been here. You need water to help you finish the ramen. 
Pork ribs - not much meat to the bones!
I really wanted to like you Bone Daddies but fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...well you can't get fooled again.",-1
4,"Ok maybe I am getting old and if I am going to eat somewhere in Soho, certain things will affect my decision regarding WHERE to go.
Bone Daddies was a must when I first arrived in London 2 years ago and I have to say that I'm still enjoying going there once a month BUT there are some Pros and Cons that I would like to share with people mid 30's like me. Let's start!
PROS:
- Ramen is really good, tasty and rich. I normally go for a TANTANMEN but also SOY RAMEN is lovely and the price is good (11£ or less),
- food is coming quickly,you don't have to wait ages and there are also some nice thing on the table like elastic band for people with long hair or additional garlic, chilli and sesame.Nice!
CONS
- nice food = big queue. Don't think you go there on a Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday evening (after 7pm) and you will get a table in 5 mins. You will get a table in 15 mins (if you are lucky...)
- This place is really loud!Loud music playing all the times. If you are going with friends, the conversation with them could be quite difficult.
- small venue: I think they might have 10 tables in total and quite closer one to the other so if you want a bit of privacy or having a chat (hard with the loud music playing in the background), this could be a problem.
In the end, I give you a 4 star my dear Bone Daddies, but trust me, you'll need to get some areas improved :)",1
2,"What can I say? I'd walked past this place a few times and read about it when searching for good ramen in Soho and I have to say I was pretty disappointed :( The place itself was cool, nice ambience, good decor, clean, good location.... Was quite promising when we came in, but.... The food was average... Bummer. As a general measure when I get ramen, I always try the tonkotsu... If the place can make a good flavoursome clean tonkotsu then it's gotta be a bangin' place... Sadly the only thing good about this tonkotsu were the thin yellow noodles.. The broth was way too fatty and 'creamy' in a not so nice way as the flavour lacked depth and seasoning. You have some egg in there and a couple of slices thin pork. For the price you pay and the lack of real tonkotsu flavoured broth you're better off going to a Shoryu chain or even Wagamamas and that's saying something 'cos they're average too. The food also came out super fast which was a little concerning. Service was inconsistent depending on staff. Hmm... I feel bad to give them a dull review but... Maybe I'll come back and try something different...",-1
3,"Oh, gosh. Three stars at best. Two stars at worst. Let's settle with three because the service was really something special.
I think part of the problem I am going to have with all ramen shops in London is that none of them are going to match the ramen I ate in Tokyo a handful of months ago. It's just not going to happen. Plus, diners are waaaaaaayyyyyyy too politically correct with how they eat a bowl of Ramen in England. Please, people, just shove your head into the bowl and slurp those noodles up into your mouth. 
My husband and I started off on a good foot. We popped in at prime dinner time and were seated straightaway at the bar in front of the windows. I liked the curtains hung on the entance, very Japanese. I ordered a Berry Berry Somethingorother which was made of gin and had a fresh raspberry in it but I wasn't wowed by it. I mean, it was OK but nothing special. I was more wowed by the fact that such a fancy cocktail was served to me in what is considered a fast food shop in Japan.
On the table was:
-a bottle of fresh garlic cloves and a garlic press
-chopsticks, napkins and bibs (happy I brought my own fork, BYOF)
-a bottle of hair ties (yes, like to tie your hair back into a ponytail)
-various sauces like soy and some chili-based looking sauce
We ordered the fried chicken, the T22 and a second kind of ramen which fails to come to memory at present. The fried chicken came in a little stainless steel bucket and looked a bit like popcorn chicken but larger pieces. Some of the pieces had been sitting underneath the heating lap for an extended period of time because they were cold and chewy. Other pieces were hot as though they just came out of the fryer. I remember commenting, ""I'd rather have wasted these calories at KFC)."" So, there's that.
My ramen, the T22, was not super great or even great. Now that I think about it, it wasn't even that good. I highly disliked the crackling. The noodles looked like they came out of a packet. The chicken was sparse. And, in general, it just was not my cuppa ramen. Also, as an added bonus, I started burping up the broth about 30 minutes after eating.
Perhaps it my ramen selection that literally left a bitter taste in my mouth or perhaps Bone Daddies just doesn't have as great of ramen as claimed. Either way, there are too many other ramen shops in London to try before returning to Bone Daddies.",-1
4,"Nom. Just, nom. 
The tonkatsu ramen is delicious. Perfectly cooked noodles, broth so thick and pork bone-ish it's almost white. The right amount of spring onion, bean sprout, crispy garlic slices, bamboo shoots, and a little picked ginger right in the middle. Perfect eggs, perfect slices of pork. Topped off by a little house chili oil sauce, and wow. I ate the whole bowl and would have licked it if I could have fit my face inside. 
Just noticed I used the word ""perfect"" three times! So it's just not getting that fifth star because I think £11 is a bit much, and a pint of Asahi for £4.5 is a bit steep too. A beer and a bowl of (admittedly totally delicious) ramen coming out to £16? I happily paid, but secretly wished was more like £12 (£9 for the ramen, £3 for the beer) - then it'd get 5 stars. Perhaps I trifle. 
Anyway, as I said, nom.",1
5,"Bone Daddies is surely my favourite restaurant in London to eat ramen. I love them all, but I have a little favourite : the Tonkotsu ramen. All the broths are delicious and very tasty. 
I go to Bone Daddies at least once a month if not more.
My friends and I shared tenderstem broccoli and fried chicken while we were waiting for our ramen to be cooked. The broccoli were nicely cooked but none of us liked the sauce served with it. We didn't think it's taste went well with broccoli. Instead we ate them with soy sauce. The Fried chicken were good and tasty. I liked the fact the batter was not too greasy and slightly spiced.",1
4,"The agedashi tofu is one of the best I've had outside of Japan. The soyu ramen was also on point. However, please please PLEASE train your staff to know what ""togarashi"" is when I or anyone else asks for it. I speak pretty good Japanese, but asked for it in English multiple times. Only the Japanese member of staff knew what I was after and brought it. In Japan, it's on the table in every ramen shop I've been to. Consider putting it out to avoid this problem.",1
3,"Bone Daddies is okay. My friend and I both got the tonkotsu ramen. While the broth was okay, I thought it could have used more flavor, and I thought the noodles themselves were pretty basic. The pork, however, was great!
I think what it comes down to is this: Bone Daddies is more of a trendy, hipster spot than an authentic ramen joint. Great if you're looking for the former (this is the kind of place where your menu comes on a clipboard) but a bit disappointing if you're looking for the latter. Maybe they make up for it with the free hair ties?",-1
5,"Really, really, really good ramen and stupidly long queue - even on Mondays.
I completely buy that ramen places are supposed to be quick eats - order, sit, eat (slurp) and leave - but that's in Japan, where awesome ramen places are at every corner, not in London where delicious ramen with amazing broth and plenty of seafood for a good price - is a rarity. They should definitely open another branch - one of this is just too little of goodness.
Crammy inside, so don't expect fine dining, but then again - it's soul food! So, come in, enjoy, slurp as loud as you can (that shows your appreciation for the chef if they did a good job) and LEAVE. Don't sit and chat - let others enjoy this too (and not stand outside waiting for you to finish... yes. Even on Mondays.)",1
3,"I must admit I've become disappointed in this establishment now. 
My mum was visiting for lunch and I missed their yummy perfectly cooked egg and thought I would take her there for a treat.
Yes it is lunch hour and yes it is busy but this is a ramen joint, you know, something where they have the broth pre-cooked and they just dump the noodles and remaining ingredients in to complete the meal?
We waited 20 minutes for the starters. We ordered soft shell crab and a pork/corn croquette. After 20 minutes I complained, I said where is my food? My lunch hour ends in 20 minutes! Waiter went away and then started serving other people.
At this point the starters got delivered. Flagged down another waitress and said I wanted to complain that the 3 different groups who arrived behind us got their STARTERS AND MAIN delivered before us. She explained our starters were fried so it takes longer.
What? Frying food take longer than regular food?
Ramen came with the original waiter. He explained because there was a big group and because it was fried it took longer. I said well then you should have told me frying food takes longer and I would've just told you to bring me the ramen first! He said he didn't know we were in a rush. Mate, I came here before, I didn't need to explain I was in a rush, the food arrived at decent intervals!!!!
I was speechless. It's lunch hour in the middle of Soho which is pretty much surrounded by working types yes? We are not in the suburbs here! I was too shocked to speak and my face must have given away a million words. He explained the croquettes were on the house. 
PAH.
Because of this farce the food tasted horrible and tasteless to me. I was in no mood to enjoy any of this. We had about 7 minutes to chow down the ramen and pay and leave. I was late back to work anyway.
I'm not coming back. Don't do lunch hour if you can't handle it. 
I actually just remembered the same thing happened to me at Flesh n Buns during lunch. My colleague and I ordered 4 starters and 2 mains. After 20 minutes we chased and 2 starters came. After 20 more minutes the other 2 starters came. We had 10 minutes to make main course and run back to the office. They didn't have a takaway licence. We ended up paying for 4 starters and eating instant noodles at the office. The place was empty mind you, it's not like they had a full house to cook lunch for.
DEFINITELY do not come here if you don't have more than an hour spare.",-1
3,"I'd like to give this place 3.5 stars. I usually like to try a popular ramen spot whenever I travel to a new city. This place satisfied my craving and was pretty decent. 
I got the Tonkatsu ramen with extra egg. The eggs were exceptional! On par with the eggs at Ramen Dojo in LA. The problem was that everything else was mediocre. The noodles were thin which I tend to dislike in Ramen (but that is personal preference). The broth did not seem to have a very distinctive taste and the slices of chashu were pretty thin. 
If this were my first point of reference for ramen I think I would walk away pretty happy. This place is not bad but also not really distinctive if you have tried other ramen.",-1
4,"Quite a nice ramen joint, in a fantastic location, and thankfully, is open quite late on weekdays.
I'm not in raptures about it, as I've had better ramen in both Japan and Australia; but as far as pork tonkotsu goes, I would come back for this one. The noodles were quite thin, but they were tasty and filled the bowl with deliciousness. And I'm pretty sure I added a couple of extras... It's not cheap, but it's not expensive for London. Give it a shot!
The apple cider was also quite tasty.",1
5,"I loved the ramen here! Fantastic, To be honest, one of my favorite even though people swear by Kanada-Ya or Shoryu, in my opinion this place trumps them of all. Great creamy tonkotsu and best of all Asahi on tap which tasted that much better with a creamy lip on the pint glass. All in all my favorite ramen place in London, worth a try! Their sides are also good, but for us 2 big bowls of ramen were enough! be warned, it gets very busy and its not uncommon to wait 30-40 mins for a table!
The service is great, even when it is very busy service is attentive and helpful. But most important is the food.",1
4,"Didn't have the ramen but really enjoyed the starters. firstly, its totally not baby friendly as far as tables and stuff but the staff really handled a fussy baby well. Thanks ladies and gents!
When one has a fussy baby only a cocktail can curb the angst. Too bad they were out of the watermelon juice.  That sounded amazing. Instead I had what tasted like a 'porn star' minus the champs. The passion fruit drink was still yummy. The dza had the 'mule' and liked it very much. 
We tried and loved the fried chicken which so happened to be baby's first taste of chicken and she loved it too. 
The yellowtail sashimi reminded us of our favorite dish back home so we were more than pleased to see some jalapano on the plate. 
The soft shell crab was pretty bland and i'm actually n ot sure if it was cooked all the way through, but we still ate it. was ok, batter was like, and the dipping sauce was ok. Just an overall meh dish. 
But I really really enjoyed the food that we did try and will most def go back for more.",1
4,"I love this place, I really do and the only reason why I knock it is that it's a lot of money for what amounts to a bowl of ramen. I went for lunch with my mum and my sister (a quick lunch mind as it was a workday) and our total bill was over £50.
That said, it is damn good ramen, having tried Shoryu and Tonkotsu, it is, in my opinion, the winner in the area. Get there early, there aren't reservations and it's all communal seating. If you're a big party you might even lose your place in the queue as smaller groups are seated where they can fit.
My sister loved the fact that they had a) plastic bibs, and b) a little bottle of hairbands for tying back your hair so you didn't eat it while you slurped your noodles. And you want to slurp your noodles. Ramen arrived quickly along with a single order of croquettes and we went to town. If your noodles don't come with an egg, order the egg as an extra, it's worth it. 2 Tonkotsu and a Tantanmen were ordered on this day and the bowls went down a treat.
Get there early, sit and enjoy your noodles and then make way for the next customer. A long drawn out meal this isn't!
I'm going to um and ah about this one for a while but yes, for now, Bone Daddies your are a solid 4 out of 5. Who knows, I might upgrade it later.",1
5,"Yay!! London seems to be getting better and better at ramen!! Finally!!
I have been excited about Bone daddies for aaaages! I've been following them on twitter and drooling over the photos...so I had high expectations that this would be a decent ramen venue. It seems like other yelpers had the same idea as we had the biggest turn out ever for a ramen club! Thank you all for joining me!!
On to the noodles:
Oh my goodness the tonkotsu ramen made me happy! The soup was rich, creamy and you can tell those bones have been brewing for a looong time. I initially thought there was not quite enough broth for that number of noodles, but actually it was all so rich that I found it difficult to finish it all.
- Soup = Gorgeous...now I want to try all the other flavours
- Eggs = Cooked to perfection with squidgy middles and well-seasoned
- Meat = Fatty, full of flavour and so tender that it falls apart on your chopsticks
- Extras = It was good that you can add extra garlic...and I shared some of Rob's extra pipette of fat. Yum
- Noodles = Perfect
The staff were complete sweeties and coped well with such a large group.
The only let-down for me was the karaage chicken...the taste was okay but it wasn't crunchy (maybe they made it in advance and reheated it???) 
The drinks were also a bit pricey... over £8 for ume-shu!? wha!?
However these weren't big enough gripes to detract a star, so I think I have found my new favourite ramen shop.",1
4,"Highly recommend this restaurant for your Ramen fix if you're near SOHO. It offers a nice selection of ramen options, with new 'daily specials.' 
Fried Chicken 7/10 (tasty, well seasoned)
Edamame 7/10 (great starter, quite small)
IP Tonkotsu Ramen + egg 8/10 (very flavorful & filling)
Assorted Mochi 9/10 (favorite was sesame & chocolate)
Make sure to arrive before 7pm to avoid the long lines!",1
3,"So it's a good place on the cheap which means no reservations and just work on luck. We found a table and I ordered Korean chicken wings, this is more of a tomato based chicken wing and not authentic Korean wing but tasty anyways. The ramen, so I ordered the pork and found that the base stock was rather salty and very thick. I think I will just select a miso base next time. Good drink selection.",-1
4,"Bone Daddies. Well the name alone should have perked your interest. In cool spot within Soho this Ramen spot is uber trendy. Certainly judging by the queues and type of people you see in it.
The Tonkotsu Ramen is my personal fav, with its 20 hour pork bone broth. Corr blimey it's good. Seems to be a trend to outdo each other with how many hours you can make that broth within Ramen places but let me tell you it makes a difference.
I also really like their fried chicken. And you can't go to a Japanese without getting the chicken. Though I prefer the proper term Karaage Chicken.
Next time I will come purposely a little drunk and for their late night menu. 10.30pm-11.30pm they have a great deal for 2 courses and a whiskey cocktail for £15. Banging!",1
5,"Calvin T recently reminded me I haven't tried Bone Daddies so when I unexpectedly had a case in London I seized the opportunity to take my bff along for some ramen. We're big Koya fans but Bone Daddies is equally as good, if not quite as zen (and of course the menus are very different).
We had some delicious sake to keep us warm in the queue and then were ushered to some of the best seats in the house (near hooks for hanging coats! joy!) where we were swiftly served with drinks and our fantastic starters - soft shell crab and tenderstem broccoli with their respective sauces were absolutely top drawer. We were surprised to discover the sauce with the broccoli is made with a Japanese citrus fruit - it's hard to describe its unique flavour but that's not what we would have guessed. The fiery green pepper/jalapeno based accompaniment with the soft shell was also unusual and a great match.
Ramen was outstanding. I followed Yee Gan's lead and had the tantanmen - it's fiery kick caught the back of my throat more than once, which was awesome! My bff also loved his tonkutsu ramen, he drained the bowl in about 10 minutes.
Service as I said was swift but also friendly and enthusiastic with the staff despite how busy it was taking time to explain the sauces to us and not rushing us out despite me taking forever to eat my ramen (it really is filling!).
Finally, at £11 a bowl this is perfectly priced - for the quality of the food it's excellent value.
Excited already for my next visit!",1
3,Learned of Bone Daddies on IG and figured I would give it a shot while I was in London. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen which is typically what I order when first trying a ramen shop. The ramen noodles where good but nothing amazing the broth was thick but I didn't find the flavor I know and love. When I go back to London I would stop by again and try something else on the menu as well as grab a couple bottle of Asahi Super Dry Black so good!,-1
4,"Be ready for this hipster ramen experience. Bone Daddies has arranged the perfect union between an hipster atmosphere and quite authentic ramens. 
I hate the food fusion but mixing atmosphere with (good) food is fine. To the ramen, Bone daddies has added this typical low-light, hipster-waiters with beard. The only Japanese elements I spotted in the interior was a photo of the Yoyogi park where Japanese dance disguised as Elvis - indicating which bathrooms were for women or for men (which did not seem obvious to everybody though).
And as the food was indeed very good, let me add a few word on what matters the most in the end. For appetizers we had CHASHU PORK & CORN CROQUETTE which was a rather random choice but it was a very good pick and I highly recommend you to taste that: we were really surprised. For ramens, i had the ""T22"" (they were really inspired on this one or maybe I miss the reference) and the broth was really really tasty. Hipsters do know how to make ramens, they are evolving.",1
2,"If they want to open a pub-like Reman restaurant, they really need to think twice as sometimes innovation could just go south...
The taste of Reman was even worse than fast noodles... The noodle was too soft and soaked too much... The soup was just too artificial and the taste was bad...
It's better if its just a bar for a drink...",-1
4,"Bone Daddies' steaming ramen ""hug"" (as the waiter charmingly put it) is lovely on a cold, wintry day! I am a ramen newbie and this was my first time having authentic ramen (Wagamama's doesn't count!) and I wasn't sure what to expect. 
We started with the salmon sashimi which was so pretty and delicious! It came with bubu arare (puffed rice balls, I've never had them before but I love them!) ponzu sauce, and coriander and was so so yummy! I am a big salmon sashimi fan and I think this was actually my favorite part of the meal:P
I ordered the tantanmen 2 ramen with chicken broth, which was one of the only two options without pork on the menu. I found this a bit limiting, but I'm told that in the future they will have some beef broth options. My friend got the miso broth and enjoyed it a lot. We also admired the cute logo of the place and the interesting name (it fits so well! what a neat place!)
When my tantanmen arrived I wasn't sure what to expect with my first real ramen, and my first impression was that it had quite a kick! The broth is spicy and much thicker and creamier than I expected. After a few sips I got used to the spice and enjoyed the intense flavour it gave the ramen noodles. I was skeptical about trying the eggs at first since I am not an egg person, but they looked so good sitting there with their melting yolks that I had to try it and am glad I did. They are as silky as everyone here is saying and the perfect ramen eggs. The noodles and chicken were good and the few random pieces of bamboo. I think for a first timer, I found the broth too rich and heavy to drink it all but I enjoyed the half of it I managed. 
The service was friendly and very helpful. The place itself is probably hipster heaven with a long line of cold people waiting to get into a very busy and tiny place. I am still not a huge ramen person because the broth takes getting used to, but it is comforting in this weather and I look forward to coming back another freezing day and trying the fried chicken appetizer too!",1
3,"Meh. I'm surprised this seems to be the best London has to offer. Got the IP Tonkotsu. The broth had a rich creamy flavor but was VERY salty with little depth of flavor. The ""spicy"" IP sauce was anything but spicy. Could have done with a bit more chashu and some more varied ingredients. They also use thin, straight vermicelli  noodles, which is not necessarily bad, but it didn't satisfy my craving for springy wavy style egg noodles. Our waitress also disappeared completely after dropping our bowls which was a bit annoying. 
That said, it wasn't the worst ramen I ever had. The chashu was good and overall if you're craving ramen you'll be ok here. They also had a huge selection of toppings on the table-- crushed sesame, fresh garlic with a garlic press, spicy sauce and vinegar. I was really impressed with those options.",-1
4,"Three words; Spicy miso ramen. This is my ultimate favourite type of ramen and Bone Daddies did not disappoint when I came here for lunch one cold, fall day. The broth was delicious, the pork was melt in your mouth amazing, and the spice level was spot on. Could have done without the red straw like vegetable garnish but a minor hit on an otherwise perfect meal. 
We also ordered the fried chicken as a snack. Definitely some of the best fried chicken I've ever had as it was light and cripsy, not greasy at all. 
The service could use some improvement as we had to remind them we wanted the bill about three times and some servers were great while others were a little oblivious. Nevertheless the food was worth it and it was nice to escape the rain with a bowl of warm, comforting, tasty ramen!",1
4,"Staff serving baby shot glasses of warm sake to the people on the queue was a sign of good things to come.
After about 25min on a Sat night I was seated with some strangers (I was by myself) and was ready to order. They didn't have anymore of the cocktail I wanted (sour ginger) so I got an Ume Shower which was too sweet for my taste but ok nonetheless.
Then, the ramen.  The broth was something special and really made the dish.  The meat was skimpy and blah compared to ramen I've had in other cities and the noodles themselves fell a little short, too.  Although you get a solid serving of noodles, they don't taste much different than regular angel hair pasta. However, the goodness is in the flavor combo - between the thick, robust, savory broth and the perfect combo of toppings this ramen was totally delicious, special, and worth a try.
if i have time while i am here, i'll come back and try another ramen!",1
5,"I haven't been to that many ramen places in London, but this was the best as of yet!
I got the spicy miso ramen with extra bean sprouts and spring onion. We also shared salmon sashimi and fried chicken as starters. Everything was solid. I particularly liked my ramen -- the soup was perfectly thick and flavourful. We also got cocktails, all of which were great. 
Service was prompt and good. It did hey quite crowded during peak hours, so be sure to plan ahead!",1
3,"Our first day in London was a cold and rainy one.  I was looking forward to having a hot bowl of ramen to counter the dreadful weather.  I got the tonkotsu and the husband got the tantanmen.  The Clarence Court egg was impressive.  The yolk was barely set and was a stunningly rich orange color.  The pork was tender and flavorful, although sliced too thin.  I wasn't a fan of the menma.  It was too sour, almost like eating bamboo shoots from a can, where they acquired this unique sour note that is absent in fresh or vacuum packed bamboo shoots.  
My main complaint was the broth.  There can be too much of a good thing and in this case the broth was too rich and too thick.  I love a rich broth like the one from Santouka, but here, it was hard to appreciate the complexity and the umami taste of the broth because it was too oily and viscous.  Husband liked the tantanmen, but I find the peanutty broth too sweet.",-1
4,"Ordered the ""TANTANMEN 2"" which they warned was spicy - but was just fine. The Chicken bone broth is thicker than I was expecting, almost tastes like a peanut sauce. I wish it wasn't as sweet, but overall very delicious.
My colleague ordered the mushroom vegetarian, which I think I will try next time.",1
4,"I don't know: I bodied this tonkotsu ramen.  Washed it down with a gingery cocktail.  Walked home in the cold, with a warm belly full o' noodle sloshing (yeah, that sounds gross.  It felt good, though).
There is a wait.  It's not biggie, they've got heat-lamps and it moves fast if you're solo or a party of 2.  
Love: efficient, tasty, well-priced, tasty, tasty.  Did I say: tasty?  
YEAH.  
Super-appreciate that, despite being a busy spot, never ever felt rushed to finish up and open up my seat (I had some 2015 catching up to do with a pal!).
Great, attentive service - good tap water (yeah, yeah, it's a consideration!) served in great cups.
One watch-out: the tantanman ramen?  Hot as Hades.  Delish, but *hot as Hades*.  As my dining companion advised: ""they should have a flame icon next to that one!"".  Wurd.
Yelp note:  just flipping love the DIY counter in front of you - garlic and press and sesame and soy and hot chills.  Yes.",1
5,"This place is da bomb. We ordered the edamame with their sweet/spicy sauce on it. So good. We also tried the Salmon Tartar and Soft Shell Crab apps. Both were delicious, especially the sauce for the crab. 
I ordered the tantanmen ramen and it was THE BEST ramen I've ever had. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in London. 
My only complaint is that they try to fit so many people in small spaces. I was continually bumped the entire time and I don't think this would be a good spot for big groups.",1
3,"Substandard ramen. I don't know why everyone praises it. It actually takes a while for the food to come out-- what is up with that. 
Some of the appetizers are quite good though. 
The stools are uncomfortable-- beware.",-1
4,"I have been on the hunt for some good ramen joints so I was very excited to find Bone Daddies. Back in the states ramen places like this are everywhere and they just now seem to be catching on in London.
We tried the fried chicken and the tonkotsu ramen. Both items were delicious. The chicken came out hot and crispy with great flavor. The ramen broth was rich and comforting and I was very eggcited to get a soft boiled egg as well.
TONKOTSU RAMEN with spring onion, chashu pork(20 hour pork bone broth)",1
4,"Cutest little hipster restaurant! Best tonkotsu ramen in town. Fantastic artichoke when in season. Insane ribs - and im not not one really like ribs!!! 
 
More often than not very busy with queues.... Try Sunday for a late lunch!",1
4,"I've been wanting to go to Bone Daddies for ages and finally got to go! I have to say I was not disappointed. It definitely lived up to my expectations!
We got a window seat so that was really nice. I had the mushroom ramen and it was amazing, SO tasty. I mashed one of the garlic cloves available on the tables which made the broth even tastier.
The atmosphere was buzzing and it was quite busy but we always felt looked after.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Already looking forward to going back!",1
4,"Stopped in here an hour before closing on a Friday. The place was packed but we were greeted quickly and we grabbed a beer at the (tiny) bar while we waited. We were seated on two stools in the back  corner--definitely a tight squeeze so if you're not a fan of bar seating or close quarters, this isn't the place for you. I opted for the late night  special--a signature drink, pork bun and curry ramen for £15. We also tried the soft shell crab appetizer and the pork ramen. The signature drink was tasty but unmemorable. In a joint where cocktails can run you £9, I wasn't complaining in the slightest. 
The pork bun was delish! The bun was soft and fluffy and folded over pork, fresh cucumber and hot pepper. The ginger sauce that accompanied the soft shell crab was superb. 
As for the ramen, both broths were delicious but the curry stole the show for me. It came with small pieces of fried chicken, roasted hot peppers and cabbage. The broth was very rich and flavorful. The pork in the pork ramen was sliced thin and flavorful and the broth was light and...well porky. It also came with an egg which always adds some welcome richness. 
A nice touch was that they provide both plastic bibs for slurping splash and hair ties to pull your hair back! I thought these were some thoughtful details. 
Service was great despite being packed, food was delicious--this spot gets my vote!",1
5,"As a ramen junkie from New York, I've been traveling around the world looking for great bowls of ramen. I've been happy with the recent boom of higher quality ramen in the cities across the world, and traveling through London, I've been very impressed so far.
I have heard Bone Daddies being compared with Kanada-Ya as the best ramen in London, so I had to come by and try it out. I stopped in at around 1:30 PM on a Wednesday, and there was no queue to get seated.
The space is bigger than expected, and seating was comfortable. They have a decently sized cocktail menu, some Japanese beers on draft, and a fairly impressive shochu and sake selection. There are sesame seed grinders, chili oil jars, and fresh garlic (with garlic presses) at each table, which I really liked.
I ordered a Cambridge G + T to start out, which is a tailored gin with Japanese botanicals served over ice with a bottle of Fever Tree tonic and a lime wedge. It was refreshing and great on this boiling hot summer afternoon.
For my starter I got the fried chicken, which is prepared in the Karaage style. It was decent, but just a little drier for my tastes, and some of the cuts looked weird - not uniform chunks, so perhaps the thicker pieces came out juicier if they cooked at the same time? It came with some lemon, but due to some of the pieces being drier than others, I would have preferred a sauce, perhaps a tonkatsu sauce or something? The seasoning was good though.
For my main, the star of the show, I ordered a bowl of the tonkotsu ramen, which is my personal favorite style. Born in Hakata, tonkotsu ramen, or ""pork bone"" broth ramen is usually very rich and served with straight and thin noodles, since the broth sticks very well to the strands. It was absolutely perfect here, thick, rich, and absolutely perfectly seasoned. The broth had a nice layer of mayu black garlic oil at the top, and was topped with a nicely cooked marinated soft-boiled Clarence Court egg, scallion, bamboo, garlic chips, ginger, and bean sprouts.
The noodles were cooked perfectly, and the broth was absolutely perfect. I pressed a clove of garlic and put some ground sesame into the broth and quickly finished the noodles. I was still hungry, so I ordered a kaedama (extra noodles) and more bamboo. It came out very quickly (within 90 seconds), which is a great sign of a ramen kitchen, and I finished every drop of the broth.
The bowls are fairly priced here and they don't nickel-and-dime you for each additional topping like some places do, and the service was on point. I highly recommend this ramen joint to anyone who likes ramen in London, and I'll definitely be back here whenever I'm in London!",1
4,"Summary: 
+Great soya ramen 
+Lighter broth compared to tonkotsu (pork) based ramen
+There's usually a queue. So watch out. 
+Quirky atmosphere 
Overall:
I went to one of my go-to noodle places in central London. Bone Daddies is one of the specialist ramen restaurants that opened in 2012 in the midst of what surely will be remembered in history as the First Ramen Rush. (I made that up.) This was a truly glorious time for ramen aficionados in which three specialist ramen restaurants opened one after another in central London in a period of less than 10 months. It is generally agreed in our enlightened circle that significance of this series of events matches that of other events that took place that year such as London Olympics, the phone hacking scandal or the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. OK, that was an overstatement. But it was a good year. 
Anyway. I arrived at the restaurant five minutes before their opening to have an early dinner. After a few minutes of waiting, a friendly waiter showed me to a counter seat by the large window that oversees the street. Across the street, I could see people cleaning large glass windows of what looked like a new juice bar that was about to open. I tried to remember what kind of shop was there before but I couldn't. I guess it didn't matter after all. If they had food, I would have remembered something. 
By the time I ordered, there was already a few more groups in the restaurant. The restaurant calls itself a ""ramen bar"". Appropriately, the counter tables and high stools decorate the hip dining space along with quirky Japanese posters from the 1960s. 
Food: 
I ordered their signature dish, soya ramen. 
The soup is based on clear chicken broth and soya sauce mix. The result is incredible richness without the excessive grease of pork-based broth. The soya sauce and slightly burnt green onion adds a hint of bitterness and flavour to the broth. 
The thin noodles are relatively easy to manoeuvre with chopsticks. They go very well with the delicate broth. I wonder if what people say about pasta (fat pastas for creamy sauces, thin pastas for light sauces) also applies here. 
The mild peppery taste and the crunchy texture of fresh mizuna leaves are a lovely addition. I previously never understood the appeal of this understated green vegetable but I have now revised my opinion about it.",1
2,"Went there on a Monday night at 6:30. Place was packed!! But we managed to get a seat for 2 within 5 minutes. Waiter was very accommodating and found us a table away from the doors.
+2/5 stars for the tantanmen 2. Brothy. Nothing special. Couldn't find the meat. Was supposed to have pulled pork and minced chicken but none was found!!! Maybe the waitress didn't get our order right. Idk. She didn't speak English as a first language. 
Had an Asahi beer to pair. Super good combo.",-1
3,"I know... I'm in London searching for japanese food... but I can't help it when I love noodles!
found this place on yelp and decided to try it out for lunch with LG.  the place was easy to find but there's a wait during lunch.  
we studied the menu when we were waiting so once we sat down, we already knew what we wanted.
to start, we got the soft shell crab. it was delicious! crunchy! tasty! great dipping sauce! meaty! this is a must order!
I got the kimchee ramen and it was not up to par... so I'll end there. 
just get the soft shell crab and beer... can't go wrong",-1
3,"So, this place has great ramen, and at roughly £12, the price is pretty reasonable.
However, the 12.5% service charge is outrageous! For me, a service charge of this magnitude is only justified in a proper sit-down restaurant with great service, which this is not. First, the server didn't get our order right. Second, the server didn't remember at the end of the meal that he had served us. Third, you don't even get a proper table and are squished in amongst others. None of these are huge issues, except when the cost of my meal magically increases by over 10%.",-1
5,"If you're looking for the closest thing to authentic Ramen outside of Japan, this is it.  With communal tables, this isn't the kind of place you'd go for a privacy but it's a great place if you want to be a little cheeky and eaves drop on your fellow diners conversations. Being in such close quarters with them, it's difficult not too - but expect others to do the same to you!   
BD's can get busy, but the staff are quick to keep an eye on the seating and getting you to a table so don't worry if the line is out the door - it goes down a lot faster than you'd 
expect.at
   
The TANTANMEN 2 dish is my favourite, it's a little spicy but full of flavour with minced chicken, crispy nori slices, egg and endless noodles in a chicken bone broth.  
Turn up hungry, the food here is very filling so you won't be wanting desert, instead you'll be dragging yourself out in the best possible kind of food coma.",1
4,"I got the spicy tan tan ramen, which was delicious. The broth in the tan tan ramen was rich and flavorful. It was a great rendition of the traditional  Dan Dan mien which normally has no broth. Highly recommend!",1
4,"Just reviewing the tonkatsu ramen.
Yelp Japan score: 3/5
Yelp UK score: 5/5
I've travelled to remote suburbs and small towns in Japan in search of specific ramen joints, so I like to think I know a bit about it by now. And this is a decent bowl. I don't know what some of these other reviewers were served, but mine was pretty good - and so far the best I've had in London (and will likely find until Ippudo opens).  
Noodles: A bit overcooked... they should be firmer, but this is likely a local market compromise. Next time I'll ask for firm noodles.
Broth: Very good. The black garlic oil is great too.
Egg: Perfect. As good, better, than any I've had before. Order an extra one.
Charsu: Decent. I prefer it thicker, but fatty and good. 
Needs: Some ginger or something pickled (besides garlic) to cut through the richness of the broth. 
Tip: Please don't wait for your 'soup' to cool off. Ramen is about the noodles - firm noodles being sucked up coated in hot fatty soup. Slurp them, it's ok, you're allowed to slurp ramen and it cools them a bit so you don't burn your mouth to much (a little burn is part of of the experience - don't worry, you will heal). As well, letting the noodles and soup cool off, this is like being served a burger and then waiting for the melted cheese to coagulate first. Wrong, wrong, wrong. (Sorry, watched this happen a few times here.)
FYI: The price. I know it's London and ramen is still new and trendy, but £12.38 a bowl is steep. This works out to ¥2101 or $20.46! Ouch! Tokyo is supposed to be the most expensive city in the world, but this same bowl of noodles would cost you only about ¥800-900 or £5.40 even in the most expensive parts of Tokyo. (I know, supply chain and all that. But still... Cheaper in Tokyo!)",1
4,"Nicely soft and delicate ramen with well-flavoured soup. The decor of the place is good and the music and atmosphere vibrant, however it is a tight squeeze and the drinks are quite pricey. As long as you don't mind rubbing elbows with the person next to you and perhaps bumping into the person behind you from time to time then this is a good stop for a noodle fan.",1
4,"Frequented, my visits have always been pleasant and satisfying. The staff are fast, the food emerges pipping hot from the kitchen in minutes, and the casual environment makes it easy to jump in and out for a quick pre-theater bite--although it does get crowded with a long wait midday and at dinner, naturally. Price points are a bit high, but the quality of food makes up for it. The chicken karage is absolutely perfect. Marinated and just slightly battered, it makes for a great shared starter. The tender stem broccoli comes with a side of spicy orange sauce, which would make anyone adore green steamed yet cold-served veggies. The noodles are bit on the chewy/al dente side, but every ramen house has a different style, this is just Bone Daddies' I suppose. I'm also not a ramen fan per se, and usually stick to menu starters at ramen joints, so take my comment with a grain of salt. Beautiful presentation and an interesting broth, come here for a quick and tasty meal.",1
4,"The short is that Bone Daddies is a great Ramen place and worth your time.
Seating is a little close quarters due to the small space and need to pack as many high standing stools as close as possible. Service is prompt and pleasant. Due to the small space, your proximity to a staff member is always less than 2 meters in any direction.
I ordered a Tantanmen Ramen. This is the spicy minced pork variety. When it arrived it looked amazing. But I was a little disappointed as it was thick with oil. Upon tasting the broth was quite bland to the point I actually asked for a plate to remove some of it as I'm not a fan of food served like this, even if it was chilli oil. That removed, suddenly the flavours of the broth came through and it was delish. A side of fried chicken rounded things off nicely. Fried to crisp perfection, in bite sized pieces and without bones. Mmm.
On drinks, I ordered the Red rocket, a fizzy bright red concotion of raspberry, Yuzu and Soda. Delish and refreshing, but perhaps a bit much with the Ramen broth but great as a drink in it's own right.
So in all, Bone Daddies isn't a place you'll want to linger long in. It isn't designed for comfort and service is prompt and quick for a reason. It wasn't particularly busy when arriving there around 12.30pm but by 1pm it was pretty packed so advice would be to get there early as I don't believe they take bookings.",1
4,I had the mushroom ramen which is the ONLY vegetarian option (vegan if you ask them to leave out the egg in it). Bit of a pity really cause it was so so so so good. Taste-wise I'd give 5 stars.,1
2,"This place was packed. Very loud and crowded inside. This is your American version of ramen. I did not like it at all. The fried chicken was okay fresh but after a lil while it didn't taste good. I guess that comes with fried chicken. 
The tonkatsu ramen was oily and the ramen noodles was not the regular ramen noodles used at authentic Japanese ramen bars.
I wasn't a fan of shoryu ramen venue but I prefer shoryu ramen over bone daddies. By far I loved Kanada-ya ramen.",-1
4,"While I'm not the biggest Hakata-style tonkotsu ramen fan, Bone Daddies does good.
There's usually a queue at night, but you can easily pass the time by ordering a drink.
The tonkotsu ramen has a milky collagen-thick soup with rich garlic flavor. The eggs are perfect, with a creamy soft yolk. Adding chicken scratchings is a nice local touch, but I didn't feel they did much texture-wise.
The sides are hit and miss:
- Deep fried soft-shell crab? Dericious.
- Kara-age? Yes please.
- Cabbage and miso? A little too literal. Pieces of raw cabbage served with miso paste to dip. Feels like something I would eat when the shops are closed and I'm rummaging through my fridge.
I think Ippudo in NY generally does a better job, and rumor is that it's coming to London this year. While I appreciate London's sudden ramen binge, it would be nice to see more variety without a focus on Hakata-style tonkotsu.",1
4,"Wonderful restaurant in Soho. The staff were all really hospitable and the ramen was really nice. Not lots of space in the restaurant but the space available was always filled with people. Clearly this place is worth it's rating. 
I had heard about this restaurant through a Yelp search, and decided that it sounded like a great place to get ramen in London. The restaurant is reasonably easy to find, we just needed to ask a local where it was when Google Maps said we were close by, but we had no clue where to look. 
There wasn't much of a line when we got there around lunch time so we were seated right away. Because I had come with my family who didn't really know much of ramen other than the plastic packets you can get in stores, they didn't have much of a clue on what was what. The staff helped them on what the different ramen where made of and what they preferred.
We ended up ordering one tonkotsu, two tantanmen and one T22. The ramen came reasonably quickly and they were very aesthetically pleasingly presented.
The tonkotsu was very, very delicious. The dark sesame oil on top gave the already amazing broth a toasted flavour. The broth was a milky colour, as would be expected of a bone marrow, and the noodles were a bit thicker than somen noodles which was a bit surprising, given that I am more used to having thicker noodles, but they tasted just fine. The ramen was topped with chashu pork, soft boiled eggs and green onion. 
The others were very pleased with their noodles too. The tantanmen was reasonably spicy and the bokchoy on the side was very refreshing. The T22 was equally as good. 
Needless to say we were all very, very pleased with our food. The portions were perfectly filling, although there was space for a special dessert from their menu. We ordered a sesame ice-cream to share,  which ended up being a very interesting experience since none of us had ever tasted a sesame flavoured soft serve. It was a perfect end to the meal and all of us agreed that we'd be coming back in the future. 
I ended up coming back the next day for another serving since I'd been enchanted by the ramen. You simply can't find such good ramen in Norway so I had to take advantage of the restaurants' existence.",1
4,"Ridiculously amazing tonkotsu broth, esp with chili sauce added to it. Rich, thick, delicious. 
The soft boiled egg could have been cooked a little less so the yolk could have added to the creaminess of the broth ie orenchi in Santa Clara, Ca.
The noodles were not my fave; too thin and did nothing for the broth.
I regret not ordering extra broth...
The karaage fried chicken was delicious too.
Don't be deterred by the long lines- come alone or with one other. 
Big groups at the tiny restaurant would be ridiculous anyway. 
Groups of 6 were made to wait in line for 90+ mins while we waltzed in after a 20 min wait.",1
4,"I had the Tonkatsu ramen and was really impressed -- this is better than most of the Japanese ramen spots in the Bay Area and NYC. The broth was very flavorful without being too greasy, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the pork was so buttery and -- this really hit the spot for me! Cocktails were a little overpriced, stick to a pint of Asahi.",1
4,"Food: This was our first time at Bone Daddies and therefore had to try the traditional Tonkotsu Ramen which was very good.  The broth was rich with flavour (can definitely tell the broth was watched over for 20 hours) and had a good serving of noodles.  One of the things I hate is when ramen houses are stingy with their noodles. We also ordered the kimchi side dish which wasn't real kimchi (I know kimchi, I'm Korean).  Not sure if they make it in-house, but it's not traditional and was a bit of a weird neon orange color.
 
Drinks: They have a pretty good drink menu for a ramen house which includes sake, shochu, wine, beer and cocktails. 
 
Price: Reasonable.  For two Tonkotsu Ramen and one side order of Kimchi came out to 28.12 GBP.
 
Ambiance: The restaurant was packed on a Sunday evening and very lively. All seating is communal.
 
Service: The host was friendly and we were able to get seated right away which was great since I've heard about the crazy queues.  Our server was very nice and our food came out pretty quickly.
Would I go back?  Yes;.  This is the best ramen I've tried so far in London.",1
5,"I have been to bone daddies more times than any other restaurant in London. Highly recommend the tonkotsu ramen, I have tried them all and keep going back to is one. Also the chicken wings are to die for, you will want to ask for a straw to drink the sauce. No complaints other than that one time I was there, my ramen was warm, not hot, but that only happened once. Recommend to go right when they open between 5:30 and 6:30, there will be no line. Amazing place, enjoy.",1
4,"Really legit ramen. It's small and loud, but it adds to the atmosphere. I had a special which was lamb ribs and aubergine, was very good. Also save room for dessert as they have a good selection of mochi. Service was also pretty good!",1
2,I was REALLY sick from a cold and needed a ramen food fix. I was itching to try this place because nothing makes me happier than a nice bowl of soup. I found this place on the Yelp app and walked in. Right away you are greeted by the lingering smell of slow simmered broth and the sound of slurping noodles. There was about five people before us so the wait was roughly ten minutes! During this time I browsed over the menu. They had loads of ramen to look through. My husband got the soy ramen and I got the tonkatsu ramen! The tonkatsu was salty and dark. I didn't even want to finish it. When I asked the server to remove it after a bite she took t away but didn't offer to bring me the menu so I could order something else. The customer service here is rushed and not very friendly. Wouldn't go back again,-1
5,"Walking through the dark Alleys of England, amongst some not so sober people and landing in this spot was the best decision I have ever taken. I have been to Japan and most part of asia and there is something about this ramen- flavor, texture, food combination , warmth and everything about it that makes it the perfect bowl of goodness. If you love spice, noodles and basically a good cup of ramen, then they boned it here!!",1
3,"Being vegetarian I should have been cautious about eating ramen at a place called Bone Daddies, however I was hungry, in a rush and wanted noodles. 
The please is nice enough and the playlist is great but as much as the ramen was nice enough, it wasn't to my taste.  
The single vegetarian option on the menu is a mushroom ramen. So if you're a mushroom hating veggie I would probably avoid this place. 
I love mushrooms, and they sure do put the effort into making their broth meaty - which fits their style but I much prefer my noodles fresh and spicy. The meatiness of the mushroom broth was way too british style to me. It was also very salty. 
If you're a meat lover I'm sure this place is great, just not the one for me!",-1
5,"Come here and let Bone Daddies walk you face first into a wall of unctuous porky tonkotsu! Pork bone soup might scare off some, but that just means MORE SOOOP for you, Gentle Yelper (I swear I can spell, but those O's get across something I can't articulate in words).
I've never seen such a broth. Milky white and as rich as it looks, I found myself basically scraping the bowl to get the final garlicky dribbles at the bottom before making an unhappy face that it was done.
The nitamago (ramen egg) is perfectly done, with a bright orange yolk that just oozes into the broth. The squiggle of dark soy sauce is indeed unnecessary for taste, but the colors, o the colors. The pork actually was the least interesting part, but I suggest paleo/atkins folks will be happier with the slices? The bamboo shoots are great for breaks between indulging in the creamy noodles, and be sure to throw in just a little chili oil to kick things up a notch. There's also a garlic press with whole pickled cloves, but even I as a garlic fiend didn't think this was necessary. 
The ramen noodles were interesting and not quite what I've had before in other places, but they do a good job of soaking up just enough broth without wilting away.
A bowl of tonkotsu will run you £11 + £1 something for service, but as a once-in-a-while treat, definitely worth it.
Big fan of the decor at Bone Daddies, with walls plastered with photos of the too-cool-for-gakkou rockabillies in Yoyogi Park. 
I'll definitely come back to try out the tantanmen or the tsukemen.",1
4,"Korean chicken wings and pig bones are probably my favourite food in London currently. It's amazing how crispy, wet, spicy, sweet and succulent they are. I even found myself spooning up the remaining sauce.
The tonkotsu was fine but the main reason to go is the starters",1
4,"I went to Bone Daddies with a friend around 5:30 on weekday evening. It was only about less than half capacity, so we were seating inside right away. The decor is really beautiful, and the seating is mostly at communal tables. They have wall hooks around the store for you to hang your coat which was really convenient!
All of your utensils are in a big can in the middle of the table, so you can grab whatever you need. They are also supplied with hair ties and bibs so you can thoroughly enjoy your meal without making a big mess! They also had a jar of sesame seeds, garlic, and chili sauce.
Our order was taken promptly, and we ordered the softshell crab, salmon and yellowtail tartare, spicy miso, and one more ramen - the name is escaping me. 
The softshell crab and the tartare was delicious!! I will have nightmares about never getting to eat it again when I leave London. The sauce that was included with it was also to die for - super spicy too! The tartare came with some fried lotus chips, and the combination was like a new, japanese take on the holy grail of chips and salsa. 
A reason why I knocked Bone Daddies down a star is because it is too salty! I used to stay away from ramen places because I thought they were ALL too salty; later experiences taught me that really good ramen has salt, but it isn't distracting at all. If only Bone Daddies was a little less salty it would have been PERFECT.
The service was mediocre - there wasn't anything bad that happened but I have definitely had better service in many other places. It was a bit on the pricey side, but I also got the pricier appetizers to start. Overall, it was a solid ramen place, and I will most likely be back for more.",1
3,"I wanted to like this place, i really did!  I became a huge fan of ramen whilst living in NYC where people queue for blocks to get into some of the best ramen houses...but bone daddies just didn't cut it for me.
I went on Saturday and had the tantanmen ramen, as i was in the mood for something spicy.  However, the chicken stock combined with the seaseme oil and crushed peanuts gave this a strange aftertaste that lingered long after i had left the restaurant..
Thinking i had made the wrong menu choice, i went back today and had the only ramen with pork broth. The Tonkotsu Ramen is the benchmark upon which all good ramen should be judged!  Again the broth, although very thick and velvety, lacked any real complexity. Further the addition of what seemed like sweet soy sauce, gave this ramen a strange unfamiliar taste.  Even the ramen noodles themselves miss that delicate nutty taste you get from a great freshly made ramen.
Although this place is lacking authenticity, this is still not a bad place to go for some winter warming soup.",-1
5,"Ok, my favourite ramen place in London! 
Love the deco, very low key, casual. The ramen are great. 
I wouldn't got for a starter for 2 reasons:
1. ramen are big and filling, plus so good, you don't want to have to leave some behind 
2. They are a bit small in portion for what you are paying, which was disappointing
Service is great, super friendly.",1
4,"When I think of ramen in London, I think of Bone Daddies. Yes, more than likely you will need to queue but that's only a sign for what's inside is worth it. 
The food is tasty with quite a variety of ramen bowls, leaving you with a very satisfying fullness. Particular shout out to the soft shell crab! 
The place itself, as others have mentioned, is hipster, with a casual feel. It can get pretty loud in there due to the size and music but you can have a conversation fine. What I like are the cute touches. On the table there are bibs for obvious reason, but also little jars of hair bands. As a female with long hair, this certainly helped me out.
A frequent diner and would urge anyone else to try it out. Yes, a bit on the pricy side but we are in London after all. Definitely go and see for yourself.",1
5,"Summary: 5 stars even against my list of 40+ noodle soup places globally.  Quality ingredients are why you pay the price of 11£.  Appetizers are nice.  Great service. Don't be such a snob, wear the bib.
Atmosphere:  It's a little noisy, but the decor is so cute.  Would absolutely recommend going with friends.  Went for lunch.  Very few people at that time, though I'm told lines are quite long.  To get the full experience, you should wear the bib and tie hair. Not too many people were doing this. I think that's a mistake.  
Service:  Excellent.  Nice happy greeting when I walked in.  Very quick service.  Ideal for the short span I had for lunch.  
Food: Full Stars!!
Soft shell crab - 4 stars!  well tempura'd and cleaned.  As an appetizer, it's not bad. I wouldn't rave like the others on the list, but I can't rate it low either.  The mayonese mustard was ok.  Solid execution, but just not quite my thing.  This was not the basis of my rating.
The ramen - 5 stars!  On the suggestion of Yee Gan, I had the tonkutsu.  The broth is a delicious thick meaty hearty yum.  The noodles were reasonable, though I have had slightly better quality noodle.  This was not bad though.  The egg was wonderfully marinated in soy teriyaki, the pork retained it's own sweet flavor.  I really appreciated the toasted garlic.  Have not seen that one, or at least not so well executed. If you're a huge garlic fan, they also have a garlic press that allows you to add to your heart's content. Other condiments include hot chili, which I like versus the typical Japanese hot powder.
Soft serve green tea ice cream -  5 stars! I find myself surprised that I have such high marks for ice cream.  This was particularly good.  Aside from having just the right green tea and sweetness (not too overpoweringly sweet), the soft serve texture was something special on an unseasonably warm sunny day.  Amazing and worth trying!",1
2,"The atmosphere is good. I ordered their vegetarian dish, which is probably not their best dish but given the reputation of this place it should still be better than average. It was alright.
Would have been 3 stars overall, but lost a star for service, they were a bit rude, an older woman was either the manager or owner was a bit pushy. We showed up just to order drinks, and they said they were only seating dinner, that's fine. We returned an hour and half later for ramen, but we got the impression they would rather not have our business. There were open seats.
And there was a Stan's dad, whole foods thing.... I don't know if you have ever seen the South Park episode where Stan's dad Randy buys lunch at whole foods and Whole Foods auto opt in for donating to a feed the children charity. Same deal. Check comes and they've already adding the donation for the charity and hand me a brochure for the charity. They could have at least said by the way, ""Tonight will include a donation to such and such charity"". 
Overall, 3 stars.",-1
5,"How has it taken me this long to review Bone Daddies?!
Good, god. I love this f*cking place.
I refer to Summer 2014 as the Great Summer Of My Ramen Awakening, and it all started with Bone Daddies. These guys were my first, and it's been a slippery, noodle filled descent into a full-on obsession. 
I may wander, I may experiment, but Bone Daddies has my heart.
And, with the news that they're opening in East London so near to my flat, it gives me yet another reason to never leave my Islington / Hackney nest.
Bone Daddies is London's best ramen, believe the hype.",1
4,"Hip dining. Tried their kimchi ramen and it was an instant hit. Place is fairly small and crowed, ambience is pretty loud. Be considerate and eat and leave since there always seem to be  a long line waiting. I hate it when people just sit there forever after they eat, if you want to catch up, go somewhere else, be considerate when there are other people waiting for tables. We waited for around 45 mins.",1
3,"I've had a lot of ramen in my life & although Bone Daddies is pretty good, I just don't like the thick broth. It makes it so much more heavier than it should be.
I've been here twice and have ordered the tantanmen both times. Flavor wise, it's fantastic. I love the garlic press at the table and you can even ask them for extra chilies to make your ramen spicier. Like I said, I just don't like the thickness of the broth... personal preference if you will. 
Other than that, I love the casual atmosphere and communal high-top tables. Service is very friendly and pretty good.",-1
5,"Having now had the opportunity for multiple visits, I've eaten my way through all the ramens and most of the starters. My visits have produced a consistent level of food and service, which is nice
What I love about the ramens is that they all taste different. Though I thought that my favourite would continue to be tonkotsu ramen, in fact my current favourite is tantanmen ramen which has the same depth of flavour in the soup but it comes with a great chilli kick - I love it but if you don't like heat, then I would recommend that you ask them to dial it down a bit
I echo Tim L's advice to ask for cock scratchings (crispy chicken skin) which add a wonderful crunch and umami kick to the dish
As for starters, I prefer the salmon sahimi over the yellowtail. Crispy soft shell crab is great, especially with the spicy mayonnaise though the portion isn't the biggest. A great sharing dish with friends is the artichoke, where you can all dive in and pluck the leaves to dip them
The drink variety is big from no-quibble tapwater to sake (served in a traditional wooden box) all the way to cocktails
The only warning is that the most recent addition to the bottles of condiments on the table that you can add to the ramen is actually a bottle containing hairbands! Definitely inedible but as my dining companion today, Minnie M said, it was the perfect thing she needed to stop her hair getting into her bowl of soup. They really have thought of everything!
Perhaps the greatest accolade for this place is that it's the sort of  place I'd be proud to bring friends. Still the best ramen in town",1
3,"Ambiance:
Super busy and crowded. LOUD music, cannot have a conversation. Waitresses are friendly though and the service is good.
Food:
Fried chicken YUMMMM is a must must must.
Tonkotsu Ramen: The soup is THICK, but the noodles are super thin. More slimy than it is soupy.
The food is okay, but it's not worth the wait. 
I like a homey ambiance with my warm ramen, but this is more of a social bar-like feel. Not for me but seems to be a hit around London!",-1
4,"I drank the Kool-Aid that is Bone Daddies bone broth. 
I LOVED this ramen, real talk. And how 'bout that sesame grinder ... eh? eh?
Fried chicken: Bite sized pieces of crispy crunchy chicken - nothing new there EXCEPT, add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice from slice provided and go ahead and grind some sesame seeds on top of that. Heaven
Edamame: Standard, but served in a good sized portion for two or four to share.
Tonkotsu with roast pork: Exactly what I hoped it would be and more. Broth was buttery and creamy and rich. Egg was perfectly cooked, noodles too. Meat was roasted perfectioness. Presentation was great too - didn't have to go hunting for the meat slices or that egg. I added cock scratchings per another reviewer's advice but it didn't do much for me. In fact, it pushed the flavour over the brink of salty/rich-ness; will not do that again. Didn't get the pipette of fat either and have no regrets.
I had a cocktail that did not bowl me over (despite the waiter's enthusiasm for it). Can't recall its name, the watermelon one. I'd stick to beer next time.
Tips
DO NOT USE APPLE MAPS TO FIND THIS PLACE. Just ... don't.
With all the other reviews I was worried it would be obnoxiously loud but I had no problem with that. But I don't feel I was warned about the cramped space. I mean really. Expect to be bumping elbows and brushing asses at every moment. Wait time was about 5 minutes for two on Saturday at 7p. No dessert menu. Two apps and two ramens was a tad too much food for two people, and way too much salt (even for this savory food addict).",1
5,"If you like rich fatty unctuous (yes, I said that overused food critic descriptor) ramen then you can't get much better than Bone Daddies unless you go to Japan of course. This place is all hyped rock n' roll non-traditional but really does that matter as long as the ramen is good? Like I said the broth is silky smooth and super creamy - my favorite way to have ramen. The noodles are springy and the chase pork was tender. Everything was super tasty. I wish they would put out the free pickles like they do in Japan but that's a small quibble. The home made pickles are worth ordering as an appetizer and an antidote to the richness of the ramen broth. The ramen bowl was enough for me without any other snacks. I wasn't even able to finish the bowl but I've grown accustomed to ramen coming in man-sized portions.
They don't take reservations and they don't have a waitlist where you can leave and wander about, you'll have to wait in line and people don't rush in/out like they do in Japan so be prepared.",1
5,"I am pleasantly surprised by the quality and authenticity of food here. 
I ordered a tonkotsu ramen, a yellowtail sashimi, a side of kimchi, and a glass of junmai.
I wasn't really expecting any authenticity, but they caught me off guard when they started pouring the sake into a shot glass placed inside a masu. Okay, the owner knows something, I thought. 
Then I started to pay more attention. Yellowtail sashimi was prepped with coriander and ponzu, and they made no mistake there. The combination of junmai and yellowtail went very well. I then ordered a salmon sashimi. The salmon was prepped with puffed rice and herb and the dish was impeccable.
Ramen didn't disappoint me either. The noodle was chewy, the egg was just right, and the soup was rich but not too oily. 
I would come back when I come to London. Good job guys.",1
5,"So, there I was, thinking I should really leave my 100th review for 100 bar in Piccadilly, but a) I haven't had time b)If i could, I would give 100 points to the tonkatsu soup in Bone Daddies. So there.
After a particularly gruelling day sitting on pews that were so uncomfortable during my stay as a juror, I wanted to take advantage of the fact that I had a free evening without work. Decided to call my friend, 5 minutes, ramen agreed. bam. done. 
Turned up at Bone daddies before 6, which is a good tactic of our tbh. We rarely ever go for late dinners because well, we live far out. Tonkatsu ramen ordered. I skim-read a few reviews and was impressed, and I was not disappointed. THE SOUP. OH GOD. SOUP IS MADE OF DREAMS. Rich, Buttery and had OH-so much depth. Combine with the silky eggs. JUST. SO.GOOD. 
Ramen, was alright but I was too occupied by the soup and the eggs. 
Apparently, Timeout said that dinner for two would be approx £60. (SERIOUSLY, kids don't know how to thrift.) We had two beers, two ramen + service charge and it was £34. and we left full and satisfied. IN YOUR FACE.",1
2,"Service was great. So, it's sad to say, but it was two stars at best as a ramen joint.  Three stars as an izakaya-ish place.
Noodles of ""Tonkotsu Ramen"" were totally overlooked and broth was not even warm. (Sad ...) Plus, broth didn't have good thick flavor. I also tried ""Vegetarian Mushroom Ramen"" that my partner ordered; it was flavorless as if they were trying to make a flavor by just adding too much salt to mushroom dashi. ""Fried Chicken (Karaage)"" was delicious though.
Also it was VERY LOUD.  We were sitting next to each other, but we could barely hear each other.
This is the 4th ramen joints I've tried in London and the least favorite.  I'm glad I tried but would not go back.",-1
5,"FINALLY a tasty ramen shop in London! It's been over a year and a half since I moved here from LA and I've been so sad about the quality of Asian food here. Everything seems to fall flat, and I don't know why.
I went with a friend and had their cabbage and miso (starter), artichoke (starter), and Tonkotsu Ramen. The starters were incredibly moreish. The cabbage reminds me of a very homey veg + dip my family eats in China and is a fab alternative to the typical edamame. The artichoke is paired with a delicious dip with just enough kick to keep you interested. We also tried a pineapple sake and Asahi beer. The beer is some special Asahi brew (I don't understand beer so don't quote me) but it stayed really cold and had a delicious rice-flavored aftertaste. The pineapple sake is dangerous -  reminds me of the fruity yogurt soju at korean bars - tastes like juice!
Bone Daddies do chashu pork really well. They do broth really well. They do their eggs so freaking well that I would push you, your mother, your grandmother, AND your little dog down the stairs to get more. Luckily for your family, you can order extra, and for a mere £1. Perfectly soft-boiled and so flavorful, the egg was the star for me. I have had fantastic broth at Ippudo in NYC and Daikokuya in LA but that egg is legend. And speaking with Chef Ross, it's only going to get better. I am dancing in anticipation.
Almost forgot to mention another star - their homemade chili oil. Don't be intimidated by the chili flakes in there. It adds a toasty, smokey, warm heat to the ramen without being overpoweringly spicy. I think it's a must, if only because it adds yet another dimension of flavor.
It's a brand new restaurant so they are constantly working on their menu, broth, and noodles. I personally thought it was all amazeballs, but I certainly welcome their ambition for better.
If you're one of those people who think Wagamama is an acceptable place for food, do yourself a favor and get schooled by Bone Daddies.",1
4,"Wow! This place has got pretty darn good tasting ramen. It can definitely give Daikokuya in Los Angeles a run for their $$. Having heard about this place on Yelp! I was quite excited to give it a try. We came here on a whim during one of the unusual snowy weekend in London. When we got there we got seated immediately by the uber friendly staff. The ambiance here is very casual, hip and on the loud side. The space can be a tad cramp but we were comfortable.
Foodwise, I had the tonkatsu ramen while my husband had the soy ramen. My tonkatsu soup was pork bone base and as the menu stated took 20 hours to achieve its perfect rich flavor. The soy soup on the other hand is chicken base thus lighter but equally delicious (yep I had a slurp off of the mister's soup). Both soup had a descent amount of toppings (spring onions) while the noodles was just right (not too soft or hard). I cant tell if they were handmade but I found it really tasty. My only gripe here is the temperature of the soup. I thought that it could have been a bit more warmer than what I was served. Otherwise everything is good in this hood.",1
4,"When I walked into Bone Daddies with a friend, it was really crowded, but we only had to wait a few minutes until we were seated. The server was friendly and the ramen was really good. Broth was flavorful and I liked the option to put different toppings on. My only complaint that it was too salty for my taste. However, that's more of a reflection of my individual taste because my friend didn't agree with me.",1
3,Good ramen but I prefer Ippudo. The eggs were too cold for my taste and I was quite disappointed by the noodles. The soup was pretty good though.,-1
4,"We arrived at 8pm on a Friday. I was worried about a massive queue but we were seated relatively quickly (albeit along a wall!)
We shared some fried chicken (tasty, not greasy although nothing too amazing). We both had ramen. My friend had the miso ramen which she loved - better than Koya!  I had the tantanmen ramen. I love spicy food but found that the heat overwhelmed the dish a bit but that said, I still loved it. In addition to the pork mince and one measly leaf of bok choy (um, couldn't they have upped the ruffage a bit??), there was also a soft boiled egg, peanuts and what I think was bamboo shoots. All very tasty!
I'd definitely go back to try the rest of the menu.",1
3,"Maybe I've been spoiled by other ramen shops. Maybe I'm becoming a ramen snob. But whatever the case may be, the ramen at Bone Daddies was a major disappointment. We ordered the tonkotsu ramen and tantanmen ramen, and they both came out in decent-sized bowls (I wouldn't call them large, though), but the ramen inside was just... not ramen. The noodles were some kind of flour noodles that you don't see in typical ramen, which made the entire texture of the dish very strange. On top of that, because they were flour noodles, they tended to clump together if you didn't separate them right when you got your bowl.
On the bright side, the soft-boiled egg was made perfectly, but sadly, that's the only highlight that I can say. The atmosphere of Bone Daddies is unique enough, but it's not a place I would frequent again or recommend to anyone for ramen.",-1
3,"Alright this is a tough one cause I'm not big fan of the food. Business lunch.  They should probably change their name to the House of Ramen. ( I'm not talking about your regular Jail House Ramen by the way)  oh no. This is the fancy type, made in Japan.  I'll recommend getting liquor up for this, unless you're a hippie or vegetarian, in which case you're fine. I had what I thought would it be a safe choice: the steak - it looked nice and the meat was good, just a little too spicy.. and the need to ease down on them seeds! but I guess that's some cultural thing.",-1
4,"Although the restaurant is small, slightly squishy & the line out the front looks daunting the food is well worth the wait. Great vibe, service and for soho I was amazed with how great the price is! Best Ramen I've had in London. Only 1 option available for Vegetarians!",1
2,"This was really disappointing considering the good ratings. I'm from Toronto and this didn't compare at all to the ramen back home. I had the tonkotsu ramen and for a broth that was supposed to have been stewed for 20 hours, it really didn't taste like pork bone. Or anything for that matter. It was really thick and fragrant but it didn't actually taste like anything. Their chili oil also lacked any spice. The service was good though, the presentation of the food was nice and the place itself seems pretty hip (hence the two stars). But when it came down to the actual food itself, I am really disappointed and you shouldn't come here if you're looking for authentic ramen. If anyone knows of authentic asian restaurants in London please let me know!",-1
4,"This is now the second decent ish ramen place I've tried in London (after Shoryu) and I was extremely satisfied.
Food:
We ordered fried chicken and pork ribs to start (though it was called pork bones or something different). The chicken was executed well and extremely tasty. The ribs were one up though. Tender, and in an awesome sauce.
Had the Tonkotsu ramen for my main. 
Broth:
Thick and aromatic, I had high hopes. It semi delivered but just a tiny bit less flavourful than I expected. But initially at least, pretty damn good nonetheless, particularly after adding a bit of garlic.
The big caveat with the broth here is that there's quite a short optimum time to eat it in. Because of the thickness, as it cools down, it gets almost sedimentary and you can feel individual bits of it as it goes down your throat. At that point it gets notably less nice.
Noodles:
I like the texture of the noodles. Bit chewy but highly enjoyable. Their per bowl ratios are pretty off imo. Either they need more broth or less noodles in the bowl. It's really not an ideal ratio the way it's currently served.
Drinks:
I'm still pleasantly surprised when a place has mostly craft beers even though (fortunately) it is such a fast growing scene in this city. Had the kernel pale ale and really enjoyed it. Been meaning to head down to the Kernel brewpub (only open on Saturday for a few hours) and this has only increased said desire.
Overall:
When it comes to ramen chains no matter how many places I try I seem to have hardcore ippudo loyalty. This is the closest I've had to that in London, so I know I'll be back (and soon).",1
5,"In the centre of Soho, Bone Daddies is a new ramen joint. It seems to be a mark of hipness not to have a  name or sign anymore on new places lest you might be guilty of not being cool enough to need a sign ...(hint it's next to Byron burger which does have a sign)... in fact I didn't see it at first because I thought it WAS Bryon burger. OK I clearly failed on that test of personal hipness.
Inside it has a utility interior - fairly compact and packed  already just a few days after opening with high counters and stools. Our group of Yelpers managed to straddle across the counter and the some of the window seats. The vibe is dim lighting,  loud music and competing conversations.
Started with the yellowtail sashimi which was really good. Presented on little wooden stakes it was very fresh and with a flavourful dressing plus coriander.
I had to order the Tonkotsu ramen which is always tempting but also more challenging to deliver successfully, apparently. Our orders arrived quite quickly which was good. The Tonkotsu ramen was the best I have had so far on our Ramen outings.
The stock was perfect. Rich, flavourful, savoury, complex, fatty without appearing oily. Perhaps that's the magic of the claimed 20 hour cooking where the stock and bony goodness emulsifies together. This one delivered. The noodles were great too. Special note to the toppings and the super good egg, as others have noted. The pork was the best version I have had  in London and super tender and melt in the mouth fat and meat. 
Quantity wise it wasn't a huge portion but was rich and had plenty of noodles and I have to admit I was fully satisified afterwards. Perhaps a bit more stock would have been good.
The only slight negative was that it wasn't very hot so didn't need to do that loud slurpy thing since it was cool enough to eat direct. Would have preferred it a bit hotter.
Accompanied by a nice Sake in a box.
Service was prompt and enthusiastic.
The only minor gripe for me was that the music was too loud, set at the volume level where you have to shout a bit, even to speak to the person sitting next to you. I don't know if others prefer it that way, maybe it's just me.
Pricing was relatively reasonable compared with other places and the quality was high and the meal was very enjoyable so a great combination overall.",1
2,"Thought I'd give Bone Daddies another try. Whilst I'm too scared to go for the Tonkotsu Ramen (don't think I could take the potency of the Pork broth), I opted for the equally distinct flavour of their Tantanmen.
....What a bad choice I made.
Way too much Sesame paste used in the Ramen, could barely taste the Chicken Bone broth they claimed to have included in the bowl. The Sesame paste was soo intense I almost felt like heaving.
Sorry Bone Daddies but I don't think I'll be visiting you again, blame the heavy-handed chef you have...",-1
5,"Amazing ramen! Definitely the best ones in town, and their starters are amazing too! I got there as soon as they opened, the whole place was full in 10 minutes! Definitely worth it though.",1
4,"One of the best ramen you can find in town, good menu with many items you can choose from.
Affordable prices for the quality you get
Definitely gonna go back",1
5,"This is my favourite ramen joint in London. It is simply divine, and the portion sizes are guaranteed to leave you satisfied. 
I've tried a few of the ramen bowls they have here and love most of them. The T22 is probably my die hard favourite. As other people have said, you could probably get slightly more authentic ramen elsewhere; this is somewhat westernized ramen. That being said, it's still very delicious. Ingredients like the egg and cock scratchings are always done perfectly. Bone Daddies is also very allergen friendly. They're always happy to customize a dish for you.
Besides for the ramen...
The fried chicken is one of my favourite starters. I couldn't possibly recommend it more. However, I don't love the pork/corn croquettes, and I think most of their sashimi is somewhat overpriced. 
I've had some sort of green tea sesame alcoholic smoothie there once that was on their specials board. It was divine and I keep hoping they'll bring it back sometime. Their other milkshakes, when they have them, are often equally good. 
As a last tip, make sure you have a fair bit of time on your hands. I've always been served quickly, but have also always had to queue for at least 30 minutes (as they don't take reservations).",1
3,"Too salty, too rich, I believe the kitchen is not related with Japanese, or at least the intentioned customer is not Asian but Europeans.",-1
3,Frantically busy even at 6.30pm in the evening before the evening rush...we ordered a couple of ramen before heading off to the theatre. Quick and simple...not sure if it's the best place getting your money's worth as a ramen alone costs around £12 and the ingredients and soup base are pretty standard...nothing special.,-1
3,"I'll keep this short, it's was a cold day in town & I needed to be warmed up....Ramen in broth perfect remedy! 
I was on my own & was seated promptly, tonkotsu ramen with extra egg was ordered. Broth excellent, eggs very good, ramen so so, pork, veg etc could've done with more, I enjoyed it but was left feeling I needed more & felt slightly short changed after spending £13.50 on a tiny bowl of Ramen....so off I went to Chinatown for a Chinese bun for dessert.
3.5 stars",-1
3,"Ordered ramen and the karaage. Broth was pretty good, noodles were good, and the pork chasu was decent. The egg was cold and overcooked and lacked the richness I've come to expect. 
The chicken karaage was relatively bad -- greasy with very little breading, not enough crunch. The sauce served with it was good though. 
Next time I'd go for the ramen only and skip any other dishes/sides.",-1
5,"Great atmosphere, great customer service and great food most importantly! They have a unique sauce that's really good!",1
4,Normally I prefer my ramen to be traditional but this place was an exception! I really liked my spicy miso ramen- it had just the right kick and flavour without having to overwhelm you!,1
5,"Finally made it to Bone Daddies! The spicy TANTANMEN (with sesame, chilli, pork mince, bok choy) is unbelievably tasty. The noodles were cooked perfect, broth was intensely flavored and I especially liked the creamy soft boiled egg which just took the whole dish over the top. The salmon sashimi starter was served up like little popsicles on a stick and was fun to eat and melt in your mouth delicious.
There were just two of us, so the wait was only 5 minutes which seems like we got lucky based on the other reviews. Even though the place was packed, the service was really friendly and attentive. 
The food, the vibe, the service are all great! Can't wait to go back.",1
3,"I do not understand the obsession with Bone Daddies, it is ok but it definitely isn't amazing or anywhere near the best in London. It felt like the Nandos or pizza express of Ramen. As another yelper said below, it's not real ramen. Far from it. 
I had the Tantanmen ramen which had around an inch of oil on top and one measly slice of Pork. Really? One slice? By the end of my bowl, I felt physically sick by the amount of oil that I had consumed. It started off great then quickly changed as the oil hit my stomach. On the bright side, the egg was perfectly cooked!
The best part of the evening was the drinks. 
I would rather go to Tonkotsu, Kanada-Ya or Shoryu for my ramen fix. I will give bone daddies another shot in the future, but in the mean time, I need to wait a month for the oil to leave my body. 
Solid 3* (would give 2.5* if I could)",-1
1,"service charge of 12.5 automatically
service was rude
food was expensive - total bill was 107 pounds for 4 people and none of us were full
I found the service Ruder than a fast food joint. The woman just looked at me like I was a rat off the street and did not have any manners or respect",-1
5,"Best lunch spot in Soho! There is always a small que, but dont let it deter you! The que goes quick and the service is great!
The softshell crab is amazing... and my favorite main is the T12 Ramen! 
Must try it out!",1
3,"Not my favorite ramen spot. Was pretty over priced for ramen. I had the to tonkatsu ramen and the broth was pretty good, chashu and noodles were just ok. It's the most expensive ramen I've ever had- I expected more from an £11 ramen. The venue is ok - quite small - not many tables and a lot of bar seating facing a wall. The service wasn't great either, took about 10 mins to get water. It seems like a popular place to hang out later in the evening as it got really crowded.",-1
3,"The tamago was awesome, but the black sauce in the tonkasu ramen was an overkill, way too salty. Be sure to ask them not to be too heavy handed with it",-1
5,Superb ramen. Boyfriend had the tonkatsu ramen and I had the dipping ramen. Appreciated the clean hair ties at the table for long-haired folks. Fun establishment and a great find for delicious food.,1
4,"There is a lot to like about Bone Daddies but since I've become an obsessive fan of Tonkotsu ramen I have developed my own standards. With ramen I find it hard to judge because the broth can varied each day especially when you make it in large quantities at once unlike other dishes where you mostly cook it one at a time. So if I have a 'bad' ramen it could just be a 'bad' day but of course consistency would be great to have, just harder to get. I do usually go at least twice we confirm my judgement but this review is purely based on one lunch visit.
Bone Daddies is very well lit, white and red walls, trying to get in colours of Japan maybe? High stools which I never have been a fan of but it creates a quick turnover so Iess queuing. I would associate it more a quick lunch or dinner as it does get packed as seating is limited so trying so trying to get a group of friends to dine here is not ideal. It's place you are very likely to be seating next to a complete stranger if you have an available seat next to you so no room for personal space here.Still I love the laboratory feel to it with the random jars containing condiments to hair bands and even bibs for those messy eaters. Makes life a lot easier for those who keep dropping their chopsticks and could just use the mini self service area and pick a new pair up conveniently.
So I my lunch order was the obvious choice of Tonkotsu whilst my boyfriend ordered the kimchee seafood ramen which uses fish broth instead of mine being pork. We both ordered an extra egg too for £1 which is very reasonable as some places sell it at £2.50!! I only managed to have a few sip of the kimchee broth and a feel mussels and already felt the intense heat and spice kick in. There was a generous amount of seafood of prawns and mussels. The broth was slightly sweet for easier consumption but I'm not going to review anymore as it would be wrong of me to judge based on a few sips.
So moving on to my Tonkotsu, as much as I enjoyed the thick creamy broth and the firm bouncy noodles the broth really did needed depth. Creamy and thick was all it was but flavour wise it was lacking. Although we were given the choice to add whole cloves of garlic in the broth with the garlic presser as well I felt my broth was definitely hungry for some. I suppose I'm just used to tonkotsu having many notes of flavour. But texture and ingredients compensated on all that was lost to make it still enjoyable with a nice addition of black sesame oil for presentation and some flavour. The pork belly was incredibly tender throughout, generously sliced in perfect thickness. Eggs top notch, rich egg yolk still runny inside and gently seasoned. Nice crunches came from the beansprouts and bamboo too. 
If I was purely reviewing on the ramen this meal would have been a 3 out of 5 but overall with the quick service, decor, menu choices it grabbed itself an extra star, Will need to go again to try it's other ramen though as I do want this place to do well. It definitely has the potential.",1
4,Bowls for days get in here and rattle ya bones for some tasty noodles you'll slurp right in wash it down with some sake to ya.,1
5,"I have been a big fan of ramen soup since my trip to Japan a few years back. Since then I tried many of the shops and restaurants in London and there are some decent eateries out there, but this one is my new favorite. The menu is simple with a good range of ramen plus some rather nice side dishes. We had a spicy version and a normal meat version and both very delicious. I have to say that the broth was amazing. So full of flavour with a near silky texture ... it was pure pleasure. The ingredients of the soup were also very nice, with eggs, which were still a bit gooey in the middle and meat which was very tender and nicely seasoned. I haven't eaten such nice ramen in absolutely ages. 
I will definitely go again ... and bring all my friends with me.",1
5,Best f'ing ramen in London. Period. I drop into this joint every time I am in town. I have a high bar for ramen and this place never disappoints.,1
3,"Have to say I was looking forward to coming here Bc I love ramen but was disappointed. Maybe this is the best ramen in London but it pales in comparison to ippudo in NYC. That said I didn't expect it to be as good as ippudo but when the soup came - my noodles came out hot, broth Luke warm and the yolk on my egg was COLD...guess that shows they pre make the egg. Normally the eggs are supposed the be deliciously warm and runny and cook in the hot broth. I hate leaving negative reviews but hopefully it helps the restaurant for the future....warm up your broth its soup for goodness sake.",-1
4,"Finally I have emerged from a period of hard study and no social life, to explore London trends that are no longer new. So ramen! I went to Bone Daddies on a weeknight by myself, and there was still a queue, though I got a seat with a minimal wait. Being gluttonous, I got the soft shell crab starter and the kimchee ramen. The crab was fine, though I wouldn't get it again for the size and price. The ramen was quite delicious and surprisingly spicy. Maybe even a touch too spicy? I feel a little ashamed saying that. But very delicious indeed. The noodles and egg were perfect.
The music was a bit too loud for my preference. I would have been hard pressed to maintain a conversation with someone. In and it for the ramen, that's what I say. Correspondingly, service was fast, but 12.5% added automatically seems a bit much.",1
2,"This is another ramen place in the area...  I think everything about this place is just off... but this is not far off from othe ramen places so please do not be discouraged to go if you are looking for ramen and you are in Soho...  I personally prefer Shoryu over here but that is just my personal preference - they are all technically around the same level, not so great but edible.
Try and see it yourself.",-1
3,"I guess this is your place to go if you're craving ramen in London. BECAUSE THERE IS NO PLACE ELSE. Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit because there are a few ramen joints nearby. But this place is by far the most crowded. Holy smokes, there is a line that wraps around the block around 7 PM. Heave only knows why. Maybe I have been spoiled with ramen from Japan, maybe I have been spoiled with free ramen at the office, maybe I have been spoiled since my bf can literally eat ramen everyday, but this is just not ramen. I ordered the tonkotsu broth and it was pretty plain. Tell me how a pork boned broth that has been stewed for 16 hours can be bland? Beats me. We also ordered 2 orders of the fried soft shelled crab, popcorn chicken and chinese broccolli. Firstly, the sauces accompanied with the appetizers are all a bit weird. Perhaps because the British love mayo? Everything was mayo based..broccoli with mayo? For the love of god, wwhy?!?! Nevermind that, I also ordered corn as an addition to my ramen and it was this smoked corn. Kinda cool, but didn't vibe well with my ramen. Think of grilled smoked corn bits in your flavorless ramen. You taste burnt corn. Need I say more? Save your 15GPB.",-1
4,"Theres so much hype associated with Bone Daddies and it's (mostly) well deserved hype! A very interesting menu of fusion Japanese food, that spans across way more variety than its #1 rival (Kanada-Ya). However, you should go here to try the ramen. It's 
bomb.com
, and on most days, gives other ramen joints a real run for its money.",1
4,"Wandering about Soho on a drizzly, cold ""summer"" day (really, it's August but feels like winter already! Guess it's a bit like SF), we came across a ramen shop and stepped in. At 5:30pm, it was already packed, which is a good sign. Hubs got the tonkotsu and I ordered the spicy miso ramen. Great broth and good noodles. Pork were ample and eggs cooked perfectly. What a great dinner! They even provide plastic bibs for you to wear...which most people did not use, but I did just because. Another surprising and amusing touch was a jar offering hair bands for the ladies with long hair -- because it's annoying to have hair falling into your face as you labor over the lovely soup and noodles! There was even a garlic crusher with garlic on the counter and a sesame grinder for additional flavor. Great place. Don't miss.",1
3,"Despite the mixed reviews, I decided to try Bone Daddies on a chilly Tuesday night before a gig at Madame Jojo's around the corner. We arrived at 6:40pm to find the queue already out the door, but were assured that the wait was no longer than 15 minutes. Waiting in the bitter cold certainly increased our craving for a hot bowl of soup, and luckily we were seated just 10 minutes later at the bar facing the street window. 
After unsuccessfully trying to make ourselves comfortable on the bar stools, we ordered the following dishes:
+Spicy Kimchi Ramen with Prawns, Mussels, Egg, and Corn in Fish Broth - Though not listed online, our amicable server assured us that this dish (his favourite) has become a permanent fixture on the menu. This aggressively spiced soup exceeded my expectations and is now one of my favourite noodle-based soups in London. The opaque red broth coated the ramen noodles in a clean fish flavour with a strong kick from the chilli. The lightly fried prawns and mussels that topped the soup were tasty, but the amount of seafood was a bit skimpy.
+Tantanmen Ramen with Sesame, Chilli, Pork Mince, and Bok Choy in Chicken Bone Broth - This soup tasted mainly of peanut butter, which was an unpleasant surprise to my bf. Though we were warned that the dish contains peanuts (in case of an allergy), the predominant peanut flavour should be mentioned in the description.
+Pickle Plate - A well-executed plate with a variety of pickled vegetables (cauliflower, daikon, carrots, beets), kimchi, and pickled Asian pear. A must for any lover of pickled foods.
I also ordered a Maiken-Me cocktail (shochu, ume shu, watermelon, salt) which unfortunately tasted like the nondescript cocktails served at karaoke bars around London and cost nearly as much as a bowl of ramen. Save your money.
I thoroughly enjoyed my seafood ramen with kimchi, but am not sure I would try any of the other broths on the menu after struggling with a few spoonfuls of my boyfriend's Tantanmen. I am not generally a fan of tonkotsu broth to begin with though, so I found the lighter flavour and consistency of the fish broth welcome. However, Bone Daddies should be more explicit about the strong peanut taste in their Tantanmen ramen. Many people (including my boyfriend, unfortunately) have a strong aversion to the taste of peanut butter, which the broth resembled after it had cooled. The Tantanmen ramen reduces my rating of Bone Daddies from four stars to three. 
(Visited November 2013)",-1
2,"The ambience here is casual, and the location is perfect--right in the heart of one of the busiest night life and food neighborhoods in London.
So why two stars only? 
Because their ramen is subpar and not real ramen!
Maybe it is the ramen snob in me, or maybe London just has different standards for ramen. So take this review with a grain of salt.
My girlfriend and I came visiting London to try out some of the tastiest food stops we could find on Yelp and through other review sites. We are both huge ramen fanatics, so we had to give London's highest reviewed ramen shops a stop. Unfortunately we were left disappointed. 
We ordered the tonkotsu ramen and the tantanmen ramen. The portions were decent. The price was decent for London standards as well. But the ramen....was just not ramen noodles. In fact, the ramen noodles reminded me more of pasta noodles than anything else. (Completely different type of noodles.) 
The broth itself had a strong peanut taste to it, and didn't taste like pork broth at all. Bear in mind that authentic tonkotsu broth is supposed to be created by slow cooking the fattiest pork belly for over six hours to create rich and intense flavors.
If this was named something other than ramen, then I would probably say it's a decent eat. But to take the name of ramen and to create something completely different....
Well. I definitely can't be recommending the ramen here to anyone. If you're ever in Japan, Los Angeles, or San Francisco---definitely stop by some of the highly reviewed ramen shops there so you can taste what real ramen tastes like.",-1
5,"Second visit here, very delicious. The fried chicken are taste. The grilled pork in the dipping ramen are very delicious. The only issue is the music are too loud and noisy, would be better not to make it like a night club. So far so good, really like this restaurant.",1
4,"To be honest I don't know all that much about ramen, but I CAN say that this is delicious. I'm surprised we were seated so quickly on a Friday night, but hey no complaints there! The service was efficient and friendly, no complaints there, and the food came out quickly.
My friend and I both had the tonkotsu ramen, and I ordered mine with extra egg based on Yelpers talking about it. I'm DEFINITELY glad I ordered it, because the egg was delicious. The broth was delicious and rich, so rich I couldn't finish it in the end, though my friend happily did. There's ample noodles so although the price seems a bit steep for what it looks, it is DEFINITELY filling and worth the money. The only downside I have is that the pork could have been cut into smaller pieces instead of just laid in one sheet on top of everything - made for some awkward chop stick work!
On the table is garlic and a garlic press, as well as little bowls of chilli paste, perfect for both of us who like our food spicy and garlicky. You eat around a table communally with others, and although it seems a little tight there's enough space for everyone to be comfortable (unlike the awkward shoulder-to-shoulder seating at Flat Iron). 
I've been dying to come here after a bunch of good reviews and I'm so glad I did! Would definitely go again.",1
4,"Came here on a cold, blustery day and the hot bowl of ramen hit the spot!
My sister, cousin, and I all ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen.  In retrospect, I think I would have preferred one of the other choices because of my preference for thinner broth.  Despite the thick broth, the ramen was absolutely delicious.  It tasted fresh, with tons of flavor.  The only topping I added was chili oil to make it spicy.
We came late in the afternoon, so we had no problem with getting a seat.  I have heard it can be difficult to get a table for dinner since they're so popular.
One last thing I have to mention... I love that they provide plastic bibs and hair ties to insure clean eating!",1
4,"I don't know when ramen became the 'trendy' thing in London (a trend which seems to have now passed because I'm so late on the review game) but I'm not complaining, always up for good azn food.
I haven't had the rest in a while but their T22's stellar (is it just me or is their noodles a little skinnier than it should be?) The chicken's more tender than you expect and not dry at all and you just need more of those cock scratchings (lol). 
Buttttt... The best best best thing about this place is its sides. SOFT SHELL CRAB. YES. That green chili ginger sauce is SOOOOOO GOOOOOD! I like ramen and all, but this is why you come back. This and their fried chicken. Yeah, there are a bajillion chicken shops in London but this is FRIED. CHICKEN. Fried chicken that tastes so good it doesn't even have to be crispy to win you over. By the end of the meal the last one right at the bottom of the little metal bucket maybe sitting in a little condensation still makes you go yessssshhhhh.
Apparently they now make their own gin up in Cambridge which is pretty cool. Their MAIKEN-ME (watermelon shochu cocktail) was a bit too sweet for my liking and not quite watermelony enough unfortch but mad props for the g&t!",1
5,"We all have that friend that goes ooooon and ooooooon about that one place and absolutely wants to take you out THERE - even if he/she has probably already went 3x in the week - right?
Well Bone Daddies was THAT place of one of my dearest friends in London, and I actually love a good ol' ramen - so hey, why not? 
The place doesn't seem that Japonesy, and to be fair, a bit in the hype of Soho - I would have probably not even gone in by myself. Anyway, we got there around 6:30 on a Monday, and had to wait around 10min to get seated - so I can easily get that it can get over crowded during the weekend.
I went for a Tonkotsu ramen - and not wanting to be crude, it was not far off a foodgasm. The egg was perfect squishy, the noodles were tasty, the broth has just the perfect seasoning. Not bland, not overpowering. Nom nom nom.
Our night out cost us 17£ each for the ramen + extra + diet coke - which for Central London is not excessive, and in this case a very good value for what I got in my plate.
Can I go back tomorrow? :D",1
5,"The pork-bone broth is mighty and meaty; rich in all the best ways. Good bowl full of other tasty goodness too; just enough meat / veg to go with the ramen and broth.
The T22 was excellent too; a markedly different experience and less intense... but lovely all the same. The cock scratchings are a must regardless.
Kara Age is tasty too, and the cocktail / beer / sake selection is good too. Yet to be let down by a choice I've made here.
Also like the atmosphere. Ramen is not a civilised or pristine thing to eat; nice to have a loud, noisy and chaotic place in which to not feel at all self-conscious about slurping and generally diving in.",1
2,"Had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant. However, the experience was a let down. I ordered spicy miso ramen. The broth was so VERY salty that I could not taste other flavour in it. The ramen was just so so. I also ordered fried chicken and pork ribs as snacks,both of them are tasty(that's what those 2 stars for). I would not recommend the ramen to anyone and I probably will not visit them again.",-1
4,"Tasty ramen in central London.  Inside Bone Daddies it isn't very big and they've mostly gone for the large communal style tables with stools.  I've been told by my friend that lived in Japan for 4 years this is quite normal as in Japan you would normally just eat at the counter after a heavy night out on the drink. There comment was it was a shame that they also didn't serve gyoza to go alongside the ramen.
When we arrived on a Saturday evening we didn't have to wait long for a table and while we were waiting they served us drinks from the bar.  The beer wasn't too badly priced and the ramen was around £10, which is the same at a lot of other ramen places I've been too in London.  We found out that the chef is Australian but of Japanese descent and that you can request your noodles hard or soft, which is authentic to the cuisine.
I ordered the dipping ramen, this is a cold ramen dish perfect for a hot summers day.  The dip that it comes with is hot though.  I do like this dish but I find it a bit trickier to eat using the dipping sauce and always feel there isn't enough.  I'm sure that it's much healthy than the traditional ramen and it's still pretty tasty.",1
2,"Go for the sesame soft ice cream.  That's the only thing on the menu worth eating.  Stay AWAY from the ramen.
Seriously, I think London sometimes deserves its reputation for bad food.  If Londoners can't discern between good or bad ramen, what can I say?
Seeing the 4* reviews here, I had high expectations for this place.  The queue wsa about 30 mins long, on a Tuesday night.  We went for the 20-hour broth, of course.  It was insipid and bland.
Service was horrible, as well - our waiter basically ignored us for 20 mins before we could place our order, or grab our cheque.  Small wonder that there are such long queues for this place..",-1
4,One of the best ramen I've ever had: get their mushroom and soy veggie one! And be prepared to queue: it's no-reservation. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars.,1
3,"I love ramen. I live in NYC and try any new ramen joint that opens. When looking for places to eat on my trip to London I came across Bone Daddies. The photos looked absolutely exquisite. 
The scene is rock 'n roll. Hectic, loud music, hip waiters running to and fro-and packed. 
My wife and I started with the tuna sashimi with citron dressing and fried chicken. Both, where so incredibly salty that they were barely edible.
For Ramen, my wife ordered soy sauce and I the tonkotsu. For sure when they arrived, they were the most beautiful bowls of ramen that I had ever seen. Unfortunately the flavor didn't match the esthetic. While they were very good they would certainly not the best Ramen. They both lacked something. The flavors were off.
The ramen definitely not bad at at. It's just that the whole scene is style over content.
The one thing that we both thought was fantastic was the soft serve black sesame ice cream. 
______",-1
4,"* SPICY MISO RAMEN - I have abandoned the theory that the fairest way to judge the restaurant was to order the basic. What can I say, I like spicy! 
Let's break it down:
o Noodle - Normal portions, nothing to note here. Of course, noodles are my favourite part, so I think they could be a bit more generous with the noodles. 
o Broth - Best part! The spicy miso really takes the ramen broth over the top. 
o Pork - Not much to note here, mostly because the meat portion was a bit skimpy. What was given was delicious.   
o The egg -  Finally, a place that acknowledges the importance of the egg and keeps  it as a standard component in the ramen. Well done! I forgive you for the light meat portions. 
o Overall - Super delicious.  
The menu had a wide selection ramen flavours and sashimi as well. There is definitely more exploring on this menu to be done!",1
4,"Came here with two fellow Yelpers on Sunday in a relatively quiet and deserted Soho. We showed up at 1 pm and there wasn't even a queue! We ordered the fried chicken and the chashu pork croquettes as starters, but the fried chicken didn't come until later and was served with our ramen orders, which was a little too bad. Both were very good though! They have a few ramen specials on the board, but I went with the classic Tonkotsu Ramen, which did not disappoint. I also love how the restaurant has garlic crushers on the table, because I definitely think adding one into the soup made a world of a difference. My friends ordered the T22 and they really enjoyed it too. And I don't know what they do to the eggs, but the yolks are bright orange and they sure look unique!",1
4,"Pork-bone broth is very rich, enjoyed it quite a bit.  Not perfect and I'd rank it one below Tonkatsu in terms of the overall ramen experience, but worth a go.  The croquettes were surprisingly well worth it, great flavour though a bit small.  Place gets pretty crowded so don't go expecting a nice quiet bowl of ramen.",1
1,"I completely agree with Eve L's assessment.  We tried out the restaurant on a friend's recommendation, and were majorly disappointed.  The place was packed with Asian clients, so it looked promising, but I guess none of them were Japanese, because this was not a RAMEN experience, it was entirely something else.  The ingredients on top were cold, as Eve mentions (pity I didn't read her review before going) and the broth was warm at best.  Although my Tantanmen 2 dish promised sesame, chile, chicken mince and bok choy in a chicken bone broth, what it had was massive amounts of PEANUTS!  It was so rich it tasted like peanut butter.  Since when has ramen tasted like that?  Perhaps I ordered poorly, but my wife also agreed.  Our children had the Soy Ramen and that broth tasted as though they'd simply throne in a few Knorr chicken stock cubes and some soy sauce.
Sorry, but this isn't a Japanese restaurant, IMHO.
Oh, I almost forgot to mention the highlights...the Clarence Court egg was impressive (and delicious), as others have mentioned, and the beer was VERY cold!",-1
4,"The ramen was awesome. Had the kimchi and traditional. Would give it 5 stars but it is a little too pricy for ramen. Also they have some questionable things on the bars (E.g. hair ties- gross what if they are reused? Also nothing covering the chopsticks.)
For two pints and two frames it was about 62$ USA. In Los Angeles this would have cost us 25$ USA. So not sure why the price was so high.",1
5,"I am not an afficienado of ramen but Bone Daddies has provided my best experience (by some distance) to date.  It was not all plain sailing as I had to work past a pretty significant queue to get into the restaurant itself.  However, once inside, everything was spot on.  The decor was funky with stools jammed into every conceivably place which made for a cosy atmosphere.  This said, without cramming in all this seating, I dread to think what the queue was like.
The ramen itself was the real deal.  I opted for a special, the Sour Pepper Ramen, with roast chashu, karaage salmon, grilled spring onion and an egg.  The broth was perfectly judged with its deep spicy flavour providing a solid base for its accompaniments.  Indeed, the broth was so lovely, I would probably have been satisfied with this alone.  Of the accompaniments, I loved each delicate flake of the salmon and the perfect texture of the egg.  However, the best aspect of the dish was its variety.  Every bite brought another delightful taste senstation.
On the side, I ordered some edamame beans.  Served warm with a good slug of salt, these were lovely, if not the most original choice.  Looking at the other reviews now, I suspect that the soft shell crab might have been a better option.  I look forward to doing just that on my next visit.",1
5,"Best ramen I've tried in London.  As good as any in new york, apart from undefeated champion ramen gods ippudo. And the egg in bone daddies' tonkotsu ramen is phemonemal - there is some unholy unami in that yolk.",1
1,"Very disappointed experience, when they serve you warm soup...
Warm Ramen soup, and they dare to charge you £11 for it, is simply a joke. We went there and waited 20 mins for a seat on Sunday which is fair enough. Then when my Tonkotsu ramen came first and they brought out a wrong ramen, we were already give a sad face. (The correct ramen shows up 5 mins later)
To be served with hot noodles, but warm soup and cold char-siu, is simply a crime. The way they try to skip step to serve you a proper ramen soup is amazing. They heated up the bowl really hot, and really cooked their noodles (that's hot), Then they add luke-warm soup base, and cold ingredients on top. Thinking you don't know what temperature they are when they serve it because the noodles and bowl is hot, and it will warm everything up is very wrong.
We ordered 1 soft shell crab, 2 bowl of ramen, 2 greentea, and walk out needing to pay £20
We rather eat at home",-1
2,"So the trouble with Ramen in London is that most of the ramen places are still predominantly offering Tonkotsu based ramen with pretty thin noodles. I think the reason why they do this is due to the local palate and familiarity with this type of ramen.
However, I'm afraid my favourite ramen is made with a miso/chicken based soup with a much thicker noodle with lots of fresh bean sprouts, spring onions, bamboo and sweetcore. Ideally served with a nice strip (not a slice) of fatty oily cha shu pork on the side.
It's a good place to visit and the atmosphere is pretty vibrant (it's in Soho!). I guess the owners haven't dared to venture too far beyond what the local customers are familiar with. One further example of this is that a popular Japanese drink, calpis is not on the menu but can be ordered as a cocktail?!
Okay, if you ask them very nicely they will serve this for you but I guess it's just too foreign for them to want to list it on the menu. Overall, the place is not bad for a bowl of ramen if you're desperate but I honestly have had much better (and cheaper!) in other countries.
Sadly this is a common trend in London where foreign palates needs to be adapted to the local established expectations. It's more a comment on the lack of adventure and acceptance of exotic flavours of Londoners.
Maybe I need to reset my own expectations in order to really enjoy what this place is all about.",-1
5,"I went the first time and loved the drinks the little containers holding hair ties for women to keep their hair back as they slurped, etc. I just wasn't a huge fan of the ramen. I got the 22 hour pork one and the broth was so thick it was almost like pasta with lots of sauce. But I went back the next week and had a miso ramen with extra hard boiled egg. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. It was delicious. The cocktails, I've tried mostly sake ones, are delectable. Definitely go, but talk to your waiter about what kind of ramen would be best for you. 
Fast and good service too.",1
5,"I will keep coming back here again and again. My new London favorite! Honestly I had very low expectations for this ramen. My favorite ramen in the whole world is Ippudo NYC and in my experience nothing has even come close to being on that level. However, Bone Daddies changed everything. First I started off with the sweet and spicy pork bones which was an amazing appetizer. They were ribs with quite a bit of meat on them with a very spicy peppery sticky sweet sauce. I couldn't stop licking my fingers. I also tried the hamachi sashimi appetizer which was wonderfully fresh with a hint of ponzu.
For my ramen, I chose the tonkatsu ramen because of the 20 hour pork broth. The broth was rich in flavor, the pork was tender and juicy and I ordered an extra egg because I love the way they're cooked with a custard like yolk. Next time I'll be order the tantanmen to get a little more spice!
You might have to queue for a bit but I didn't mind. The waitstaff were super nice which is not always the easiest thing to find in London and they made the queue outside bearable with a shot of sake!",1
3,"'£11 seems like a lot for a bowl of soup'. Um yeah. Not being an enormous ramen enthusiast myself, I was underwhelmed at Bone Daddies. It certainly did nothing to convert me to the ramen cause. I spent £23 here and left hungry. I could have spent that on a decent roast and left groaning. 
They charged 3 quid for a tiny cup of tea, I had two. That's £6 for about a half pint of oolong tea. 
I wasn't a fan of the tonkotsu ramen itself, it seemed pretty average and I didn't like the meat. I've had better ramen at beatnik Vancouver dives for about $5. 
However, the fried chicken was the best I'd ever had. My advice: do not share a portion, get your own. And the soft shell crab was divine. Get your own. 
I thought the service was friendly and quite good, we stayed for an hour and they never rushed us once, despite the queue of people waiting. 
i must be in the minority of not thinking this place was great, because I showed up at 11.45 and by 12pm, there was a queue of Asian families behind me. So, I guess you had better go and make up your own mind about the place. I probably won't be back.",-1
4,"And finally, something on the UK ramen scene worth writing and raving about! 
No more of that tasteless clear broth with no fat or oil on the surface, this is the real deal - Hakata style tonkotsu! Such eerie, cloudy and unbelievably unhealthy broth yet oh so nourishing - and that's the charm of it. Pretty standard toppings, nicely made egg, and yes, as much garlic and chili as you would dare to add. 
The big thing going for Bone Daddies is the tonkotsu broth. The noodles aren't exceptional, nor are the sides, or probably even many of the other dishes, but that's fine. The tonkotsu broth makes up for it, in droves. 
It's got a wonderful little atmosphere, it's obviously in a great part of town, and if you head there at the right time there will be a queue - that's the sign of a good ramen joint in my books. 
Get the tonkotsu, that's the signature dish. I would be happy if they stopped making the other types of ramen, and just focussed on perfecting it, but since when have you seen a restaurant in the UK focus on one thing only? 
And finally, only 4 stars because the other broths really aren't worth writing home about, the chāshū is cut way too thin, and the noodles are a bit meh... But really these are minor gripes, so go forth and set yourself a new ramen baseline.",1
5,"The latest in our Ramen Club outing was to Bone Daddies, the hip new noodle joint in Soho that's staying true to Japanese way of life. It's the latest in the trend so the core challenge is to differentiate itself. Now we (mostly me, but this is based on discussions with said Ramen Club too) judge ramen on a number of categories: Noodles, veggies and associated toppings, meat, egg, and of course the all important broth!.
Noodles - Cooked perfectly with just a hint of resistance in each bite. I find that too often the noodles are cold (not enough time out of the fridge before the broth is poured in) or mushy (cooked and then broth is added). So this was a noodle win topped only by Tonkotsu's offering.
Veggies & toppings - The veggies in my bowl were crunchy and flavourful so my one gripe would be that there weren't enough of them. The toppings were sparse in the bowl but I appreciate that you can add from a variety of items on the table. There is a sesame seed grinder (I've never ground sesame into anytime but it helped bulk out the broth) and a garlic press with fresh garlic cloves (brilliant idea!). The one thing lacking was extra fresh chilli although to be fair there was some chilli oil (just not my thing).
Meat - This was the disappointment in the dish. I found the meat to be lacking in substance in both form and flavour. Cocoro still wins in my book for best meat although Ittenbari would be a close second.
Egg - Let me qualify this by saying I don't like egg. I have it scrambled and occasionally poached with salmon but it really isn't my thing. I haven't enjoyed it at any other Ramen place but at Bone Daddies it was incredible and I wanted another one. Yes, it's that good.
Broth - I opted for the 20 hour Tonkotsu broth. It's thick and rich and full of meaty (and fatty!) goodness. If there isn't enough fat for you, you can opt for an extra pipette of fat for 50p. One of the better broths in London and perfect for a cold wintry day (like today) and only beat by the spicy Tonkotsu from Cocoro. Man, I wish I could have a bowl of it now!
Overall, it was one of the best bowls of Ramen I've had in London. Individually, I don't think most of the components were worthy of the top spot but put together it's incredible. Also special note to the manager for his impeccable customer service in dealing with our large group (and remembering YGO who came a few days earlier), the bartender for taking the time to talk about Japanese whiskey with me (and gave me a free taster), and our sassy waitress for impeccable banter.",1
5,"Holy moly. This place is fantastic!
This restaurant is the epitome of cool, located right in the heart of Soho. Rock-n-roll Asian paraphernalia is plastered all over the walls as the most awesome music sets you in the mood to devour a huge bowl of ramen. I've been here at least 4 times, with varying sizes of groups, and every time we've been accommodated in the nicest of ways. There are more than a few delicious choices to make. If you're having trouble deciding, the staff know the menu backwards and forwards. They'll help you out.
My usual here is the Tamtamen 2. Nutty broth, cashews, chicken, veggies, GET IN MY BELLY. While it's on the spicier side, it's not too bad. Just the right amount of punch. I can never finish a whole bowl there's so much to eat! I stuff myself until I can't anymore and then mourn over the loss of uneaten ramen. I wish they had places like this in the States because it's just fantastic! It does tend to get a bit crowded during the lunch and dinner rush, but turnover is quick. Also keep in mind that they close in between lunch and dinner!
This is a must-eat if you're in the Soho area!",1
4,"Save yourself your embarrassing web searches and make sure when you google Bone Daddies, you include ""London"" as a keyword too.  Besides, all you really need to know is that Bone Daddies belongs right in Soho, with its trendy wall decor, trendy menu on a clipboard, trendy good looking people (hello good looking people).
I walked here on 9 pm Tuesday, and was surprised how busy it still was even an hour before closing, but was relieved to be seated promptly at a communal table.  I have no shame eating alone when it comes to the ramen call of duty.
Ordered the £8.8 Unnamed cocktail (Nikka All Malt, Pink Peppercorn Vanilla, Ume Shu) which was served quite bitter in a martini glass and very strong, but I'm all for pre appetizer inebriation.
Also ordered the £5 fried chicken, a little bucket containing 8 morsels of Asian style fried chicken with a slice of lemon, and finished it all myself... to the obvious amazement by my wide-eyed waiter. It was a bit salty and lacked seasoning but the lemon helped dispense some flavor.
20 minutes post chicken inhalation, my £11 Tonkotsu ramen finally came.  It was decent, with two soft boiled egg yolks shining like a beacon amidst waves of noodle and a sea of creamy broth.  I compare all ramen places to Ippudo in NYC, and I'm sure my standards will reset yet again when I go to Japan.  I liked the place, but wasn't slurping out of my bowl like a human vacuum the way I do when I'm at Ippudo.   Something was missing- maybe it was that the broth wasn't as flavorful (although putting in the chilli oil did wonders) and maybe the noodles weren't as starchy.
In any case, I liked Bone Daddies and would come back to try the other ramen offerings.",1
4,"i've never really understood the ramen craze, but then I came here!
Whenever I have to queue for my dinner I am skeptical, but the queue goes quite quickly. The restaurant is pretty cramped and getting from one corner to the toilet is a bit of an obstacle course!
The food itself though is great. The stock is so rich and so delicious. Will definitely be going again!",1
5,"Best ramen in London, and **shock** not a Japanese person in sight. This is luxury ramen cooked for hours, if not days to get the best out of every bone. I was blown away by the flavours of my chicken-based T22 soup with added corn, which unexpectedly pipped my wife's Tonkotsu for taste and appearance.  We also enjoyed the beautiful pickled fruit and vegetables, salty fried chicken and far too many of the garlic cloves that are at your disposal.
And of course, as a molecular biologist I also had to order the pipette. A dollop of extra fat (presumably duck) didn't actually do much for the already-fatty T22. Perhaps it's more needed for some of the other soups which we'd love to come back and try - especially the Chinese-inspired Tantamen.
The only negatives were that the big bowls only come half-full and could easily fit in a little more broth, and that the over-chatty staff coming and asking you how you're doing every five minutes takes away from the Ramen experience, especially when not one of them is Japanese.",1
5,"This was absolutely delicious. 
Started off with the soft shell crab, which dare I say it, I liked better than the Ramen! But the Ramen was super yum as well. I went with the waitress's suggestion (and the plethora of Yelp and foursquare suggestions too) and got the tonkotsu- and it really did not disappoint. The dish itself was gorgeous and so full of flavour. 
The venue is pretty tinyish- and it is one of those 'no-reservation' kind of places- so its ideal if you are after a quick meal.
They have one veggie main on the menu which I have to be honest I wasn't paying too much attention too. I think it was a salad?
Service was great! And my favorite part of the whole experience was the jar of hair ties on the table for women (or men!) to pull back their long hair- nice touch!",1
3,"Wednesday, 6.30 the queue was already building up. We queued for approx half an hour. Walking inside, the music was loud, we could barely hear each other but we all know that's the trick in this kind of places.
So queuing, ok past that. We're off to decide on food. Simple menu, few dishes, mix and match. Got the Tantamen and the Soft shell crab, as so many people do in such places.
I thought the soft shell crab in nearby Shoryu ramen was OKish, well I take it all back, that was awesome compared to what I tasted at Bone Daddies. Most flavourless, oily and soggy piece of crab I'd ever had in my life. Such a disappointment and practically too expensive for £8.50.
Past that, off to the noodles. The noodles were nice. The flavours were bold, too bold for my liking. I think the adaptation of rock-n-roll-esque decor, they tingled with the taste to be liked by the UK audience. Nothing wrong with that but my bowl tasted like a race of bold flavours. There was a lot of oil in my sauce (that only made them taste more delicious) but the profile was completely different to what I've had before. It wasn't bad - it was actually pretty nice but strong! I find it hard to say that I didn't enjoy it, but at the same time I wasn't head over heels.
That's why the three starts. Its a pleasant experience. I'm not crazy about it and I know I won't be rushing there again anytime soon. If I'm around, maybe.",-1
4,"The food here is so, so good. Here is why:
* The Tonkotsu stock is boiled for 20 hours, giving the stock the rich, lip sticking quality that tonkotsu should always have
* The pork is the best I've ever had in a ramen, it's so meltingly tender it's hard to pick it up with chopsticks
* Theres a bottle of hair-ties on the table, to avoid any stock + long hair combos
* The condiments (which are free and unlimited) are incredible, delicious garlic, ground sesame seeds, chilli oil sauce and soy sauce
* The egg in the ramen is SO AWESOME, it almost outshines the other amazing additions
* There are napkins in a holder on the table. More noodle soup places need to do this
* The fried chicken is awesome
*  The Asahi smooth head is really great (never seen it in the UK before)
*  The food really is so, so good
But it just misses 5 stars because:
* I don't like the atmosphere, it's too loud, crowded and I'm pretty short (5'4) which means I am so far from the ground on the stools it's slightly concerning
* There's nowhere to put your bag or coat if you're on the side of the table nearest the door
* The service is erratic. Doesn't bother me so much but our fried chicken we ordered came half an hour after our ramens, even though we asked after it twice, which was slightly annoying as it would have been delicious before, but after we were all a bit greased out
* Please, please give your noodles a little more spring and bounce! For me that would crown this the perfect ramen!
* My bowl was slightly lacking in stock, there wasn't enough to slurp with each spoonful of noodles and I felt I was running out
Next time I would come at an unusual time so it wasn't SO packed (although the food was so good I'm perfectly happy to queue for 20 minutes again. I'd also order extra noodles for £2 and hope I also got a little more stock. Also, top tip - bring antacids, this food is RICH!
I love the food here, I can't wait to come back!",1
3,"Bottom line up front: Ramen is okay, the sides are much better.
Things I've tried:
- Tonkotsu. The broth is thick, but lacks flavor. The noodles are good and the eggs were excellent.
- Tsukemen. Noodles totally stuck together. The eggs were worse than when I had the Tonkotsu.
- Karaage. Delicious! Squeeze your lemons on those suckers.
- Croquettes. The pork and corn croquettes are interesting, but I probably don't need to try them again.
I hope an actor does a dramatic reading of this review on YouTube.",-1
4,"The ultimate in comfort food. Never had better ramen!
I had the tonkotsu made with 20-hour pork broth. It is rich, flavoursome, filling, refreshing and the noodles, veg and egg melt in your mouth.
A couple of admin points: it opens all day at the weekend (Yelp suggested it was closed at the time we were there) and they don't take Amex.
This is real soul food and is definitely worth the trip I highly recommend it! A new London gem.",1
4,"So, I'm eating my first ""real"" ramen, as in, it's not $.10 Maruchan ramen from a package, while listening to blaring Van Halen and Guns N' Roses and being served by a slew of Australians... And it was glorious.
Along with several of the others, I ventured for the tonkotsu ramen and there isn't anything more I can say than what the others have already said, but I'll go ahead and repeat!  Oh, that broth.  That broth was so tasty.  And Yee Gan graciously shared his pipette of fat with me, which made the broth even tastier!  How often do you get to share a pipette of fat with someone?  Not often.  It cracks me up just typing it out.  There were some sprouts, but nothing overpowering, and they softened up nicely in the bowl.  I think it may have been marginally better if the noodles had been slightly harder in the beginning as they were quite soft by the end.  I couldn't finish my bowl due to the almost overly generous portion of noodles.  But they were very, very tasty!
That egg is the stuff of my dreams.  I was looking over at Katie and Rob's bowls with a bit of jealousy as they had the foresight to order a spare egg.  The yolk is so buttery!  Om nom nom.  All the extras on the table really added to the dish.  I know I probably should have tried my first ramen without any additives, but when you're given a garlic press to play with, how can one resist?!  The pork slices in the ramen were so tender and were falling apart upon contact.  And with just a bit of fattiness, they added to the rich broth and my half-fat pipette delightfully.
I ordered the yellowtail starter which was really nice, but nothing outstanding.  Just good, fresh sashimi with a bit of chili, cilantro (because I'm a Texan and can't get behind ""coriander"") and some soy.  I tried a bit of Rob's fried chicken and agree that it just wasn't quite crispy enough.  Think chick-fil-a nuggets without the pickle juice marinade, if you've ever had them.  Also had a bit of Yee Gan's soft shell crab, which was tasty and came with a lovely, spicy sauce, but also could have used a bit more crunch.
My first Bone Daddies ramen will most certainly not be my last!",1
5,"I just started working in the area and my coworker sent me here for the ""best ramen in London"" and it was so delicious! Our server helped me pick what to order after discussing my spicy tolerance levels. Portions are large and prices are very fair for London. He picked the perfect dish! A trendy place with friendly vibes and a social laid back atmosphere.",1
5,"You always know it is a good restaurant when you see a long line of people waiting outside, even when it is cold. Bone Daddies is such a place. I passed by it several times without knowing its name, but only identified it as the busy Japanese place in Soho. 
A few days ago, I took advantage of dining out on my own and presented myself to the host as a lone diner and got seated immediately. As I was rushing to something else, so I just ordered Tonkotsu (Pork) Ramen, which seemed to be the only option in my opinion, because all other ramen comes with chicken broth. I am no expert in ramen, but I have eaten enough of it to develop a taste for thick and creamy broth that only seems to come with pork bone broth. I was not disappointed, as a matter of fact, I think it is the best ramen I tried in London! The broth was thick and creamy, the noodle was al dente and the eggs had semi-runny yolk. It was perfect. If I had to complain about one thing, I wish I had a bit more broth! Oh, yes, don't forget to help yourself and add some extra fixings to you bowl: you can grind your own sesame (please do, it adds so much taste to your noodle), mesh you own garlic (only for the brave and no meeting other people afterwards eaters), and chili oil. All I can say is Yummy! I can't wait to come back and give the chicken bone broth a go and also try out some appetizers everybody raves about.",1
5,"Believe the hype. In fact, take the hype, tag on a little extra and then believe it. You won't be disappointed.
And there is hype around this place. The queue for a table was 45 minutes' worth when we showed up, longer for those in parties of more than two people. Long wait times seem to be the way of the world at the moment for the hotly-tipped eateries of the moment (e,.g. Meat Mission, Honest Burgers, Burger and Lobster etc). Ordinarily I'm a huge and vocal sceptic as to whether food can be worth waiting that kind of time for. Surely it can't be THAT much better than rival, less heralded places?
But Bone Daddies proved it most certainly can be. The Tonkotsu Ramen I went for, with extra egg was the best ramen I've had and a well thought out dish comprised of pork, veg, ramen noodles and a mild but well-balanced and welcome seasoning. My dining companion's Tantamen was spicier but similarly well-received. Furthermore, it was filling. My appetite's increased recently due to my stepping up of various sports but I was not disappointed with the portion size. Yum!
The service was incredible too. Friendly, and willing to engage in banter about possible connections between Bone Daddies' menu and the movie Donnie Darko (yes!). Accurate as to how much longer we'd have to wait for and then helpful in steering us relative ramen newbies to recommended dishes. And complete with an unexpected surprise too: after we sang their praises and said that we'd like to help them in return by giving back their table (we had a movie to run for), the waiter arrived with the bill, declaring that as we'd been such nice customers he'd taken 10% off!! What the....? Before this happened this place was lighting up those five stars - now it was making the case for a bonus sixth.
Throw in the rockin' music (think 70s rock) faintly reminiscent of Meat Mission but not turned up to 11 and I had a great time here. Bone Daddies, I salute you.",1
2,"**SPOILER ALERT** I'm going to rain on this parade.
I spent a miserably cold and wet Saturday in a 9-5 exam class in the City.  To lift the spirits, I dragged my boyfriend to Bone Daddies for an early supper on the way home.  I suspect I was in the queue mentioned by the first reviewer (I overheard him talking about Cocoro!)
We ordered chicken karaage, yellowtail sashimi and edamame to start.  As mentioned in a previous review, the karaage was not crispy and I, too, believe that it may have been preperared and reheated.  The flavour was correct but overall it was disappointing -- afterall, what is fried chicken without its crispy shell?  The yellowtail sashimi was also nothing special: fish slices drenched in a non-descript soy-based dressing and sprinkled with coriander leaves.
One portion of tonkotsu ramen, one portion of chicken tantanmen ramen.  Both came out barely warm which makes clear how these dishes are prepared.  
Method: 
1. Put stone-cold ramen noodles into bowl
2. Ladle broth over noodles
3. Top with more stone-cold (pre-prepared) ingredients: split soft-boiled soy-braised egg, meat (char siu slices in case of tonkotsu, minced chicken in case of tantanmen), soy-braised bamboo shoots, beansprouts and wakame
4. Serve
Bone Daddies, this doesn't work.  Basic formula: cold ingredients + soup that is not hot enough = lukewarm noodle soup dish.  Any Asian will tell you that prior to constructing any noodle soup dish the noodles must be dunked into a vat of boiling stock or water.  This heats up the noodles which then ensures that the noodle dish is hot.  Or, failing that, just ensure that your broth is nuclear hot.
This all detracted from what could've been two very flavourful broths.  Unfortunately, we couldn't tell (although I think the tonkotsu had potential): heat brings out flavour, remember.
I had high hopes for this place but, like in any good ol' black and white love story, slipped out of the joint into the damp night with a heavy heart.",-1
4,"OK, So like every other review here I'm gonna say that this place does FANTASTIC ramen. 
That out of the way, they do charge a fair amount, it's ridiculously loud, and the drinks are stupidly expensive.
But, the ramen, is, incredible. The tantanmen is probably my favourite, having been here a few times. The T22 is pretty good too, but doesn't quite live up to the peanutty, spicy brilliance of the former.
I gotta say the tonkotsu ramen was slightly underwhelming, but horses for courses.",1
4,"Ramen - a nice, light, healthy option, right? 
I left Bone Daddies absolutely stuffed last night, a feeling which lasted me all night, and I reckon that my cholestrol levels have most likely doubled.  Job well done.  The bowl of tonkotsu I received last night was basically Gojira in ramen form.  Not only does it look fantastic, but the taste doesn't let it down - the slabs of pork are delicious and falling apart, veg in the soup add just the right amount of crunch, and the fried garlic topping is a great little bonus.  The real star of the show, however, is the egg.  Not only do you get a whole egg (not everywhere can say that), but they are perfectly soft and totally delicious - however they do them, they are amazing.  Job well done.  
On top of that, there is a plethora of condiments to choose from - on the table is a sesame grinder, soy sauce, pot of chilli oil (the kind with chilli flakes in it), and the pot of pickled garlic and a garlic crusher.  Awesome.  Oh, and you can also get additional toppings too for a couple of extra pence here and there: nori, pulled chicken, pork mince, extra egg, and - the big one - a pipette of fat.  Hey, as much as I love my arteries, I think I love pork fat a little bit more.
The side dishes on offer include softshell crab, yellowfin sashimi, and fried chicken (obviously in a bucket).  The fried chicken was tasty, although is wasn't particularly crispy which was a let down.  Still, you get a decent quantity for your £5.  The other sides were good, although I wasn't blown away.
On Josy's recommendation, I went for the hot Junmai sake which was nice and very clean tasting, although I cannot profess to be an expert in such matters.  The drinks menu is pretty comprehensive generally, containing a range of cocktails, a large selection of Japanese whisky, and a few sake options.
Overall, I had a great experience with the Yelp crew and the staff were ever helpful (even if we did have a ridiculous number of people and kept sending them to get water).  The decor is cool too with a mixture of retro and vintage Japanese photos and Asahi adverts...however, the jars on the shelf on the back wall look like they contain Alien foetuses, and there are no Lucky Cats anywhere to be seen.  What's that all about?!
Bone Daddies is very very good, and I'm looking forward to returning soon.  It's a bit annoying that ramen in this country isn't really a cheap-and-good-thing like it is in, say, the States, and ultimately £11 for a good tonkotsu is great considering that Wagamama's ramen is hitting double-digits these days.  However, I will take solace in the fact that Bone Daddies will always be able to provide me with a noodle soup to keep hunger locked up until, well, whenever the pork fat un-congeals from my stomach.",1
5,"Thanks to Josy A.'s recommendation, I finally had a chance to have some decent Tonkotsu ramen in London!  The thin noodles were firm and chewy.  The soup was not too greasy.  The half-boiled egg was amazing with some smoky soy sauce.  I also liked the extra topping grilled corn (not from a can!).
My boyfriend tried the soy ramen with chicken broth.  The soup was much simpler and lighter taste here.  He said it got a lot better after he added some crushed fresh garlic.
Oh, the tip was already included in the bill.",1
5,"That's an unforgettable place to eat when I visited London, coz' their ramen not like the traditional, the taste absolutely awesome.. I order soft shell crab ramen, cream & rich favor.",1
5,"I was so harsh before it pains me to reflect on my past-self.  Bone Daddies is pretty good, it was probably my fault for ordering something that came with fried chicken skin in it.  I've been back loads and just order without the excess crap and its great.
MY 5 star rating is so balance my 2/3 stars before.  
Plus the staff are all great, though sitting on high chairs like sardines is demoralizing.",1
5,"Yummy ramen, with a few options to pick from. You can add your own crushed garlic which i thought was great. You have to try the chicken wings. The sauce is to die for. Me and my friends were scooping it off the bottom of the bowl. To add to the fun, you can wear big plastic bibs to protect your clothes and they provide hairbands to keep long locks away from the ramen!",1
4,"Darlings, I never got the big deal about ramen. You can get a packet for .99 cents so why would I go out and pay for it? I'm not a starving uni student. Well, Bone Daddies schooled me on what great ramen is- plus they have the best logo (did they stalk me? It's a girl sticking out her tongue!) & they even provide hairties, so you can get down and dirty with your ramen. Great cocktails and several locations to get your ramen fix. New fave.",1
1,"I went here three times; first because I wanted to check out what the hype was all about. Second and third time because I kept reading reviews about how good it is, so I figured maybe I ordered the wrong thing?
I still remain disappointed. To me the broth tastes very one dimensional- donkotsu was super greasy and creamy (like cream of mushroom consistency, or for Americans, thanksgiving gravy consistency!!) but did not have multiple layers of tastes (the way the broth does at Ippudo New York for example, or the many ramen places in Tokyo.) same for miso and shoyu ramens. They make such a big deal of the fact that they ""stew the donkotsu for 20 hours"" but what's the point if all you can taste is pork fat?! I had to sprinkle 4-5 teaspoons of hot chili oil to make it more palatable (and I don't normally like spicy food) but even the red chili oil/sauce had no kick at all. (I am now thinking that maybe I should have ordered the spicy miso...) 
They are also super stingy with the toppings and the amount of noodles. I ordered some additional nori and they gave me 2 small sheets the size of half of my palm! (And turns out the the original doesn't even come with nori to begin with...) the amount of noodles was so small, I couldn't help but wonder how guys bigger than me could possibly be satisfied with just one bowl of ramen? The noodles do not have a good texture. They are almost somen-like. And I still ended up paying 12.60 pounds for it..which I guess is a good deal for a sit-down meal in central London.. But still. (And as a side note, what's with this custom of automatically including service charge on the listed price?  It's not a huge difference, but I find this slightly annoying since it feels like some sort of gimmick to charge you more without making you realize it.
Back to the ramen: I have come across ramen places of this style in Tokyo too (super greasy but one dimensional broth) and I didn't like it there either, so maybe it's a matter of taste. But a part of me is thinking that if I am the only asian-looking person there all three times I went, it's not particularly a good sign... I don't think I will come back; I much prefer shoryu and I am still having a hard time understanding what all the hype is about this place.",-1
4,"Has anyone watched that Five Guys YouTube video where the guy takes a bite of his burger and says ""Dayum..Dayum..DAYUM"" - that was my reaction when I took a bite of the Bone Daddies Ramen soft boiled egg. Mine was perfectly cooked in my Tonkotsu Ramen with the yolk a perfect golden syrup but not too runny that it melted into my broth. It tasted divine with my noodles and I thought it could have been a dish of its own but actually, since they marinate the eggs first (kudos as not all ramen restaurants do) it might be too salty to eat on its own. And surprisingly everyone's dish around me also had a perfect looking egg. Not easy to clone perfection! Okay, enough about eggs.
Unfortunately, you won't get your choice of staggering ramen permutations here, i.e. there is no option for soft or hard noodles and I'm not sure if they will give the option upon request. Try next time and tell me if it works! The noodles I had were thin springy goodness and not too soft, but not al dente either. Eat quickly before they get soggy. Noodles don't taste homemade but I can't have it all! You're probably not likely to ask for lighter broth either; it comes very rich and creamy already but if you want even more thickness, you can add extra fat!! Oh, and the bowl is super big but the broth and toppings only fill half the bowl. The bowl was begging for me to fill it with more noodles or broth so I will make a note to order extra next time. Overall, for 11 pounds, I'd say the meal was pretty worth it. 
I also had a Mr. Sparkle which was a virgin drink with orange juice..grapefruit juice..and oolong tea...there might be something else but that was basically what it tasted like. Contrary to its name, there is no sparkle - as in, it is not bubbly. It didn't particularly stand out as you can tell I have a hard time describing it ..unlike my rambling soliloquy about eggs. However, if you're looking for a clean and light grapefruity drink to try, then order this. Otherwise, go bold with the sakes :) 
Ambience-wise, the restaurant was really quite loud. The place was popping on a Tuesday night. I went during dinner and needed to shout to communicate and had a hard time hearing others. But most of the time is spent stuffing your mouth with food anyways, so it's not too unfortunate.",1
5,"The egg! Oh... the egg.
Perfectly marinated, soft, gooey centre... Glad I ordered an extra one.
I had the corn butter miso ramen-- SUPER rich, velvety and quite buttery soup. The thing that makes this ramen great is the attention to detail- the corn is clearly fresh, not frozen and charred before being tossed into the bowl. They give a fresh crunch to the dish. Perfectly cooked noodles with good bite/chew, lots of goodies in the bowl (sprouts, bamboo shoots, shredded chicken, wakame, etc.) with a variety of textures (though I wish the fried garlic that came on the tonkotsu ramen was available as an extra for the other dishes-- I had fried garlic envy!). Plus, I love condiments, and the pickled garlic, chilli oil, sesame seed grinder, and soya pot were fun to play with and allowed me to customize my bowl. Since the broth was so rich with butter, I didn't feel like it needed the extra pipette of fat that others agreed enhanced the tonkotsu broth. 
As others have said, the Karaage chicken (fried chicken as they call it) had the right flavour, but wasn't crispy enough. That said, in spite of that, I REALLY liked it and would order it again. Perhaps it is the container that they use? Though attractive, perhaps too close of quarters with the steam?
Only two gripes: There were some cartilagey-bits with my chicken (like, crunch-ow kinds), but to be expected, I think, in a chicken broth (though I would have preferred to not have those). And, as another reviewer has said, my broth wasn't nearly hot enough. Now, I've heard that some ramen places don't serve their broth piping hot on purpose, as a warmer broth is the more optimum temperature for appreciating the depth of the broth. If this is what they are going for, they should outright say it. Otherwise, I think they need to watch this-- I was surprised how luke-warm it was. 
Service was good, friendly, and accommodating (though I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group in the future since they don't take reservations). 
I'll be back, and soon. Double egg again for sure. 
(but please put a mirror in the loo!)",1
5,"Yum Yum in my Tum - Bone Daddies is the one! Well, it's kinda' rhymes! I had the Tonkotsu Raman in the Pork Bone Broth and it really was one of a kind. Be prepared for a queue and the seating is pretty tight - absolutely worth the wait though!",1
5,"Wicked Raman!! Kimchi Raman for the win! Cool location and fit out, great service. A little bit expensive at around £11 but not too bad for the quality.",1
5,"Not to rave or anything but this place is damn good. As in hipsters-do-to-ramen-what-they-did-to-coffee good. I don't care for the furnishings and the complete lack of sound-absorbing materials means that the place is an acoustic fustercluck, but the food and the service is good.
Thankfully offering more than three viable choices (I'm looking at you, Tonkutsu and Ittenbari) the menu is semi-traditional. Thank gods they didn't try to over-fusion anything.
A pattern I've noticed with fairly good r^2 is that food quality is inversely proportional to pages of menu used to describe the ingredients, process, ritual sacrifices and ablutions involved in making the noodles. Bonedaddies' food menu fits on one page (on a clipboard, neat-o!).
I had a T22 which I chose a) because I was ramening with someone who keeps Kosher and b) because I couldn't resist COCK SCRATCHINGS (think chicken pork scratchings), which were more than just a novelty ingredient.
Toppings are varied and interesting, ranging from just meat, nori, eggs and the raved-about pipette-o-fat to the Xzibit-pleasing £2 extra portion of noodles (Yo Dawg, I herd u liek ramen so we put some ramen in ur ramen...)
Drinks are good but not cheaper than any restaurant, sochu is decent, Japanese whiskey range is luckily wider than Suntory.
Service is chirpy and is adorably cool-because-I-joke-around-with-customers rather than cool-because-I-look-down-on-people-buying-my-food-and-paying-my-wages.
All in all, a pretty decent joint for 10-quid noodles (actually 12-quid for brosized noodles).
Protip: get the traditional pickles to share if you're having a bony stock; acidity offsets the heavy creaminess delightfully. Also, this sucker is open pretty late on a weekday.",1
3,"This place is hit and miss. One of the ramen we got (chicken base with chicken) was delicious, finger licking good, slurp-out-of-your-bowl good, pour-it-all-over-your-lap good. The other (pork base with pork ) was fatty, greasy, too porky (you know that porky pork taste that;s super porky? You know what I mean) and the greasiness of it was just too much and a tad off putting. Also, they brought starters and mains all together and it was a bit of a mess. I was SO excited for this place, and yea... it was good. Good-ish.",-1
3,"I don't get the hype. Their signature tonkotsu ramen with 20 hour pork bone broth is, IMO misguided. It's thick from the long stewing, almost a gravy, but to my taste buds lacking in the right flavor. I'd much rather have a thinner broth with more taste. I've gone several times to confirm and I have - the ramen is just not that tasty. It's OK. Nothing special.
I'd give it fewer stars except I do think the appetizers are quite good, especially the yellowtail sashimi, fried chicken, and soft shell crab. If only the ramen were as good as the appetizers.",-1
2,"We arrived for one of the first servings of the evening at 5:45pm. The waiters were friendly and understood we wanted a quick meal before our movie. 2 steaming bowels of noodles arrived in about 10mins. My Tantanmen arrived with its inviting reddish chilly oil floating on the surface. The menu does say bok choi, but ONE leaf??? The one slice of charshu pork was deli-ham-thin like everyone has mentioned. Broken cashews gave a nice crunch to the chilli pork mince that packed a nice punch of heat. The broth was tasty but don't let it get cold as you'll soon feel the pork fat start to coat your mouth.
My wife had the Tonkotsu Ramen which is her benchmark test of all ramen bars. The 20hr pork broth was seriously rich. Too heavy for my liking, but you can always order something else.
I think I'm missing something here. This IS a noodle bar. And this is where it failed miserably. Hidden underneath all the nicely decorated and flavoured ingredients lay the pitiful existence of a small portion of ramen noodles. They had a strange floury taste, like eating a raw pancake. I don't think they were undercooked either since they were close to turning into a very post-al dente gloopy mess. £11 will get you quality ingredients, but not a great serving of noodles.
Its all most likely paying for a fancy burger but the only think to compliment is the lettuce and ketchup!",-1
2,"Big fan of ramen and was looking forward to digging into a bowl of hot broth when we arrived. We ordered the fried chicken along with two bowls of ramen (T22 and miso). When I get a bowl of ramen I expect the soup to be steaming hot. Unfortunately, the soup was just warm so marks off for that. The miso one had way too much miso which overpowered the chicken bone soup and made it too salty. 
Last but not least, we found the fried chicken was served raw and this was after we ate most of it.  After inspecting, manager was very apologetic and tried to blame it on the fact that they use corn-fed chicken which didn't make sense to me. However, the meal was on the house which was a nice gesture. Anything less and I would have given a one star review. We were very worried after the meal but thankfully didn't get food poisoning! Will probably not be going here again.",-1
4,"I'm glamorously late to the Yelp! party review on Bone Daddies, and I'm giving this a 4* to be even more useless to the rating itself, but do I give a rats? No. Because I'm an elite yelper, and that's what we do in this town. We give our two pennies (cents if you're Ameri-porean) worth even if it doesn't mean a darn.
So. Since I'm spectacularly late, I'm going to make up for it. 
GET THE C0CKSCRATCHINGS ON EVERYTHING!! 
You'll thank me later.
If you've been following the tales of my exploits for noodles and swimming, you'll know that my professor friend and I go swimming once a week and we end up somewhere in Soho for noodles after. This time around, it was Bone Daddies turn. Besides knowing there was an elite event here, and having walked past and had one of the sexy waiters try to seductively lure me in (with good tasting noodles - and it certainly helped that the waiter was hotter than the broth they served here), I had to try the newest installment of gourmet ramen in my neighborhood.
For starters, try the BD Fruity or the Carrot and Ginger juice. Both excellent drinks on the menu. 
Both professor and I were torn at what to choose on the menu. The good thing I guess is that they have all kinds of sides. So, if you want nori on the chicken ramen, or an extra egg in that soy ramen, you can add them in at a bit extra £1 for an egg, £0.20 for the nori. 
We decided to go for the Ramen Salad (a ramen dish tossed in sesame sauce) and the Soy Ramen. Intrigued by cock-scratchings, we asked the friendly Aussie waitress about what they were. Apparently it's chicken skin/fat that's been fried to a crisp and sprinked on top of the noodles.
Now, here's the tip... Cock-scratchings are not on the list of extras, but as mentioned above and I'll mention it again, GET THE C0CKSCRATCHINGS SIDE ON EVERYTHING. It's like the fat pipette. Indulgent, but you won't regret it. 
Everything was impeccable, and the sesame seed grinder was doubly a treat. 5*s would have been given if the broth was steamier. Was too cold by the time it reached the table. I will definitely be back. :-)",1
3,"Had the soft shell crab and it was great! The sauce it came with was quite spicy but not unbearably so, very very good. The ramen was alright, not the best I've had, and a little steep for £11.",-1
2,"I'm staying in London for a few months for work and I decided to treat myself with perhaps the food that I miss most back in LA -- Ramen. 
Bone Daddies seemed to have some of the best reviews out of all the ramen places in London, so I checked them out first.
I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen and was pretty disappointed. The broth was overly creamy and was lacking any rich tonkatsu flavor. The noodles were not springy and were thin and slightly hard. They did give generous portions of the sliced pork, which was nice, but even the pork was average.",-1
2,"We have ordered tonkotsu with extra bamboo shoots, tantammen with extra chashu and eggs and kimchi ramen which was a special menu. 
We all think they did good on the eggs, chachu, relatively but not really up to the standard, and the noodle itself. However, the core of ramen is soup and i do think that it both missing something and exceeding something. 
An idea of adding peanut into the soup was absolutely a disaster, its override the richest of the fat that the soup suppose to process, instead of the pork fat which was suppose to include in the soup, instead i think they are adding more oil which totally do not blend with the original soup they had, which resulting in oilyness taste which kills the other 3 elements which was great. 
The price was ok, which is why i think they are using oil to reduce the production cost.",-1
5,"Delicious ramen! Coming from New York where there is already a big ramen culture, Bone Daddies has my stamp of approval. The broth is not as salty as a lot of places. I love the little details where they offer ladies' hair ties for practical ramen slurping! Yuuuuum!! It can be crowded during rush hours.",1
4,"We had been meaning to go here for weeks, after reading reviews on this website and comments on Twitter.  We got there and waited in a line for around 40 minutes, but it didn't feel too bad because we had expected this.  While we were part of the ""inside"" section of the line, we could order a couple of drinks which was great.  I was already a third of the way through my pint of Asahi by the time we sat down.  Having a drink also makes the waiting period pass more quickly.
The signature dish is the tonkatsu ramen (£11), so we ordered one each.  It really is excellent: the creamy broth is packed with flavour and I liked the noodles and the eggs.  The pork was tender too, but I only got one piece in mine.  We also ordered sides of fried chicken (£5) and softshell crab (£8).  Both of these were nice, but the chicken was a bit dry.  The service was friendly and personable.
I was happy with the experience, but it was on the expensive side.  This place won't suffer for that, given the high popularity it has at the moment.  I am pleased to have been here once to try the excellent ramen, but I would be leaning towards visiting one of the other good ramen restaurants where there is not such a long queue.  Then again, it could be worth a trip during the quiet time of the week (whenever that is).",1
4,"Good ramen!  
I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen, I thought it was nicely done.  I like a rich fatty broth, and they had it here at Bone Daddies.  
My friend ordered the TanTanMen but it was something like peanut or sesame ramen.  That was just OK - a bit too heavy and rich and nutty.  I think she's gonna stick with the standard ramen next time.
Sitting on the table was a jar of raw garlic, a garlic press, and a little jar of hair elastics - VERY useful for anyone with long hair!",1
3,"its not as that great as it rated. the ramen was very salty. both my friend and i feel the taste of the soup sort of weird. its not that authentic and the environment was just ok. also, i feel theres no reason for the long quene but theres a huge line to wait.",-1
4,"Had lunch with GF last weekend. Nice little Western feel Japanese ramen restaurant, and they served decent food. But being an Asian myself I would not say this is the best ramen I've ever tasted (among Asian standard to say the least). The price for starters seemed a bit too high too.",1
2,"I did a bit of research and many claim that this is one of the best ramen places in London. I don't understand the hype for this place. Did I order the wrong thing? Come at the wrong time? Maybe it's because I came here half an hour before it closed... Anyways, I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen. Pretty standard. The broth was good and that's to be expected because it's advertised as a 20 hour pork bone broth. The egg was pretty good too. The noodles were too firm for my taste and was kind of cold... The bamboo shoots and wood ear fungus were also kind of cold. The lukewarm broth didn't really help either. Service was okay. Overall a pretty mediocre place.",-1
5,"This was the best effing ramen I've ever had. Ordered the soy ramen, added some chili pepper, and dat soft boiled egg doe. mmm.",1
5,The best ramen I've ever tasted. The stock is so smooth and delicious fillings. Atmosphere amazing -they think of everything. Right down to a hair tie for the girls!,1
4,The best way to find any other ramen soup places pointless and tasteless is to come here. Had the spicy miso one and I wasn't even bothered with the loud Hard Rock music. And I hate Hard Rock music ;),1
4,"Jumped in last night for a bite before heading home. While it's not completely authentic, it is an excellent Western take on Japanese/Chinese noodles. The hubs got his normal tonkatsu ramen. The broth was steaming hot and unctuous, but the pork a little chewy. Still, for someone as picky about his Japanese carbs, he deemed it a success. He was thrilled by the fact that they serve a bowl with two eggs, instead of just one (it's the little things, really). 
I tried the tantanmen ramen--a take on Sichuan dan dan noodles (often on the top of my cravings list). It was spectacular. The broth was a beautiful combination of spice and umami. Let's just say, I could eat that bowl of noodles every day. The burn builds substantially with each bite, and by the end my nose was a bit runny (a sign of an excellently hot dish in my book). We also tried the karaage (fried chicken), which was well fried, but the breading lacked a bit in flavour.
Topped off with some ice cold Asahi, we were both impressed with this new spot in Soho. And while they say they're open late, I've yet to come across a noodle place open past Midnight. My little American gripe--Midnight is not late. I've barely just finished dinner by that point. Other than that, the space is large and open playing some of the best American rock from the 70s to the 90s. We sat at the counter facing the hipster cycle shop across the street, which (of course) meant brilliant people watching. 
All in all, a new staple to our Asian restaurant repertoire.",1
4,"yeah i would take people here! for sure. I was generally impressed. the staff were friendly, attentive and in good form. we had the soft shell crab (small and overpriced, but tasty) and the renowned fried chicken (juicy, crispy, tasty and plenty of it, not bad for a 5er i suppose).
we both had the tonkatsu...standardly it seems and yes it was very nice. not ur usual watery soup, this was almost creamy meaty goodness juice. a little salty but that's the deal huh? egg was perfectly cooked, my friend ordered another for some serious eggy action. couple of ashahi's and £50 odd later we left satisfied.
only thing I would say is they definitely cram you in, we sat in the window and it was every elbow for themselves!!! 
peace.",1
4,"Having been pulled into the ""Ramen"" fad, I have heard mixed reviews before coming here. The person I was with had been before and was unimpressed.
We were greeted by a friendly waitress that seated us and served by a keen waiter that went through the menu enthusiastcally. 
The food (from a westerners pov) was good!! I had the spicy option and it was a little too hot... I can generally enjoy a moderate heat level. My companion had the Tonkatsu and was pleasently surprised. 
Having been to Tonkatsu in Soho a few times, this place definitely competes but gets a few extra points for the condiments included like garlic and seseme seeds that Tonkatsu charges for.",1
3,"Very simple and understated décor. Not great for a date... Just simple work lunch with a mate is fine, not for a business lunch. Seats are high chairs which I am not a fan of, same goes for high benched tables. There is no privacy and intimacy to be expected. Food is great thou. Ramen is excellent and if you feel like a casual quick lunch with your mate, then pop in. :-))",-1
5,"As many have highlighted already, the ramen is very good (Tonkotsu, Shoyu), the atmosphere is ""cool"" (very Soho-ish) and the staff is super friendly and helpful. 
Yes, it's a bit loud. Yes, the dishes are not exactly how a traditional ramen bar in Osaka would prepare them (but maybe a hip place in Tokyo's Daikanyama district would) but nonetheless they are very tasty and I find that it gives the place part of its personality.
I had to queue outside 2 out of 3 times, but the waiting was ok and you could already order beers while standing up in line (when you were inside the bar). Plus, in most good ramen places in Japan I had always had to wait in line for a bit.
The people are also an interesting mix: several Japanese were eating there, and this is always a good sign. You could see locals (albeit towards the posh side of the spectrum) and tourists alike plus your occasional hollywood star and successful musician (I'm referring to you Gwyneth P. & Chris M. ;-) but nobody seemed to care (which is nice).",1
3,"Good...but forgettable.
My friend ordered the Tonkotsu which was surprisingly more bland than it looked and should have been (being very cloudy from their 20hour pork bone boiling.) I ordered the T2 whose broth was really flavorful and was ace to have the ""cock scratchings"" for crunchy texture.
Perhaps I went on an ""off-day"" but the biggest turn-offs were that the broth was pretty lukewarm and not enough of it. I'd try Bonedaddies again, but not in a rush. I still stick to my guns on the best ramen being at Nagomi.",-1
3,"Bone Daddies changed all of my expectation. First we started off by the
sweet and spicy pork bones which are an amazing appetizer. They were ribs with
quite a bit of meat on them with a very spicy peppery sticky sweet sauce. I
couldn't stop licking my fingers. We also tried the hamachi sashimi appetizer
which was wonderfully fresh with a hint of ponzu. And for my opinion their
service was good and very nice, we stayed for an hour and they never rushed us
once, in spite of the queue of people waiting. Well done",-1
4,"Delish food. And shockingly easy to get a table, considering the neighbourhood. And even better that the waiter brought our table free shots of the sake of the week before we'd even ordered. 
One star off because they did mess up my order, but as soon as I pointed it out they made it right on the quick.",1
4,Fantastic restaurant. Wonderful service and great food. We really enjoyed the starters whilst we waited. We really enjoyed the cocktails too. Would recommend to anyone and it's worth the wait!,1
4,"Super yummy tonkatsu broth and cha siu.  We found this place on yelp and arrived at 9 pm.  The place was busy, loud more like a pub. We are the only ones with little kids and its not kids friendly.  The table was counter height and chairs.  However my husband ordered tonkatsu ramen and I ordered spicy miso ramen.  Spicy miso is too salty and not as good.  But tonkatsu is out of this world, packed with flavor and thick broth.  Their eggs and char siu is very yummy too.  The best ramen I had by far.",1
2,"Average. The ramen is decent, but far from impressive or fantastic. Tantanmen2 was okay. Soup was pretty oily and strong, but you can hardly taste the chicken broth and its essence. Noodles was cooked fine, not overcooked or undercooked. Portion was big. The eggs were great, but sadly for mine it was submerged under the oil, ruining the looks and the taste of the egg yolk.",-1
5,"The best ramen I have ever had! I was loving the ramen in Cocoro, but i found a better place now. The fried chicken and friend crap is great! need to order it every time i visit! 
T22 and 20 hours broth is great!!!",1
2,Slow service with many mistakes - during a slow period too. Not a huge fan of their modern interpretation of ramen - broth was too thick compared to the extremely thin noodles.,-1
5,Delicious. Saturating the fried chicken in the ramen broth is amazing. We tried the Tottham and Spicy Miso ramen both were excellent.,1
2,It's okay to say the least not fantastic. The broth is too salty. Definitely had better.,-1
4,"I visited Bone Daddies before it had it's official opening on a friend's recommendation telling me it was better than Tonkatsu. Price wise I would say the ramen was the same (the 20hr pork ramen costing £11). We arrived early, at 12pm to ensure we wouldn't have to queue for a table and good thing we did. 
The place isn't huge and we were seated at the bar type of seating, not really wanting to share with another party. For two of us we ordered the fried chicken starter and the salmon sashimi. Originally we had wanted the soft shell crab but due to their soft opening the night before they had sold out! The fried chicken was perfect, not overly oily and with a squeeze of lemon gave the perfect sharpness to accompany it. The salmon sashimi was fresh and came with a lovely light sauce on top with little crunchy balls on top (no idea what they were, but they were good).
Of course we both had to order the 20hr pork ramen which came with bamboo shoots, an amazing egg which looks smoked and was just perfectly cooking with a runny yolk. The broth and noodles were both tasty and the egg was my favourite accompaniment. To drink I ordered the fresh carrot and ginger juice which was fine, nothing special but I expected what it said on the tin. 
When we got our bill we had been given a goodwill discount and only ended up paying £26 for two of us for allll that food/drink. I assume this is because it was still during their soft opening period. Without the £20 off it would have been rather pricey for a bowl of ramen.
Upon leaving space was quite tight and we have to squeeze to get out of the place, but all in all a great place, albeit a little pricey.",1
4,"I'm not a big fan of Japanese cuisine, but some friends took me here and I might just have to change my stance. The Tantanmen was excellent and very filling. I am also assured by my friends that it is a very good authentic version. It was perhaps a little too spicy for me, but good to get rid of the current winter chill! At £11 for the main dish it ain't that cheap, but the atmosphere and quality mean you don't begrudge the cost.",1
3,"perfect to find this place still open after a show on shaftsbury ave. Noodles rather expensive (£11 for the pork bone tonkotsu). The broth was divine, the egg still runny and umptious, the 2 slices of pork melts in your mouth. Everything was a tad salty though. Would say the portion a lot smaller than I expected (suited me fine, but friend said he didn't have quite enough) so big eaters, add noodles (£2 on top I think?)",-1
4,Best ramen joint been to in UK I don't think it's very authentic. Only gripe is went 2 days in a row second day was not as good as first so might have consistency issues other then that enjoy it,1
4,"First impression, an Asian food restaurant with almost no Asians inside - food must be so-so. But NOT at all! I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen (pork bone soup ramen) - the taste of the soup was very dense, complete with eggs, pork slices and bean sprout. Atmosphere inside the restaurant is very London casual design, with the wood furnitures and cool lighting. Waiters and waitresses are also very friendly to talk to.
Recommended.
Interesting fact - the main chef is from Australia!",1
4,"Bone Daddies is the only good place I hear about when it comes to ramen. So I finally made it on a Sunday for lunch, and I was quite happy to find there was no line. It's a casual interior with high tables and chairs. We were a group of 4 so the corner tables work best, otherwise sitting in a row would have been too difficult to chat. 
They had plastic Japanese smocks which I absolutely loved; I instantly put it on and kept it afterwards. 
For appetisers the croquettes are must-have (I liked them better than the fried chicken). Never had anything so good outside of Italy! For ramen I went for the tonkotsu ramen. I appreciated that the serving was so big but I thought the ramen noodle itself was too thin, and the soup was a bit too thick, but it did taste good especially with the egg. Each table has a container of garlic, a garlic crusher, and a sesame vial, which all I definitely took advantage of. 
Overall I really enjoyed Bone Daddies: good setting, good food and good service!",1
5,"Probably one of the best and most authentic ramen places in the UK. The price is well worth what you get. I had the privilege of coming here a few times, at first by accident and then I was hooked. 
I love the rustic interior design, although a little bit crowded it has a great personal feel to it. The waiters here are all pretty cool as well.
My favorite dish here and what I recommend you all to try it the Tonkotsu ramen.",1
5,"When I was posted in London for 6 weeks, this became my favorite go-to lunch spot. If you told me that my favorite lunch place in London would be a ramen shop, I could've (rightfully so) called you a maniac. This place pleasantly surprised me though. Whenever I went I always got Tonkotsu Ramen, since who needs anything else? One time my coworkers got some appetizers which were pretty good too but let's face it: you're here for the ramen. Having been to Japan and living in the bay area, I feel lucky to have tried so many good ramen places and Bone Daddies is up there--maybe even better than most in SF. The broth is excellent, the meat was cooked just right and the portion size is perfect for a quick but filling meal. The price for a bowl is a little expensive, but hey, it's London and luckily for me, I was reimbursed me for my meals.
If I'm ever back in town you know where I'll be for lunch.",1
5,"Wow. Ramen doesnt get better than this. Rich, flavorful, fresh and satisfying. Tantanmen 2 without chilli oil and the T22 are my favorite.",1
4,"Visited a few months ago and it rocked, literally. A bad-ass asian spot serving straight-up noodle dishes by seriously tough staff with hardcore tunes blasting. We queued for about twenty minutes, but had a delicious cocktail while waiting. The Tonkotsu Ramen was amazing. Definitely worth a second visit, love it as equally as Ross Shonhan's other spot, Flesh & Buns.",1
4,"I heard about this place through a work friend who is a massive 'foodie' so i knew it would be great. 
Centered just off Wardour St, it's a perfect location for this rock n roll ramen eatery. I love Soho and i love it even more now I've been here. 
I had fried chicken to start - not as tasty as i would have hoped. The main however did not disappoint. I went for the pork tantanmen.
This was a great dish, lots of noodles, pork mince and lots of spice, yum. I also wore the bib!
A great place to head to after work for a quick dinner.",1
3,"Ok so I've been here a few times now and whilst the Ramen is undeniably excellent I have been ground down a little more each visit by one recurring thing which I can't help but be bothered by - the music. I understand that there is an aesthetic and a brand to uphold but let me tell you this - whilst eating Ramen, I do not want to have Pearl Jam's ""Jeremy"" or ""Them Bones"" by Alice in Chains, or any other ""chin-rock"" classics piping out into my ears. Ive tolerated it each time but today I realised I could take no more when at approximately 7:25pm, my ears were assaulted by the Stone Temple pilots. In 2015 there is no excuse for this. I was in such fear that the next song was going to be ""Mmm Mmm Mmm"" by the Crash Test Dummies, that I had to rush the ramen down in light speed and get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. Quite a stressful experience, and as a result marks have been lost. Three stars, but could be so much more.",-1
5,"Just thinking about this place makes me sad. Because it's all the way across the pond and it's by far the best ramen bowl I have ever had. Yes, I've had deliciously salty and warming broths with ramen noodles before, but this one takes the cake. Wonderfully dark-yoked egg halves, crackly crunchy bits and warm complex umami flavors still haunt me in my dreams. Til next time, bone daddies, til next time.",1
5,Superb ramen.. Nicely priced too. That was a great stop on my travels.,1
2,I did not see what the hype was all about. The noodles tasted like it was simmered in the broth until it melted. I definitely do not recommend the ramen. They get 2 stars because the staff was great.,-1
4,"Very good quality ramen. Buzzy, loud atmosphere - good for a group as it's not really a date place. Friendly service though a little slow when it's so busy. Excellent cocktails.",1
2,"I was not impressed with the broth. I don't see the big fuss with this ramen joint. Perhaps I've been spoilt with excellent ramen places in California and have eaten legit ramen in Tokyo, I just do not see this place deserving a 4 to 5 stars. The broth was just too fatty, I think they just add a chunk of butter to compensate real fat flavor from pork bones. I almost puked after eating from here. I don't see the big hype about this place to be honest, I definitely would not line up and pay for an overpriced bowl of ramen. No thanks.",-1
4,"So I have to start off by saying that I do not eat anything that comes from a 4-legged animal - which means I can never have ""traditional ramen"" in pork broth. Sometimes this makes it difficult to find amazing ramen as they don't spend time to make any kinds of alternative broth. Enter Bone Daddies. Their chicken bone broth is amazing. 
Top it off with bomb fried chicken & amazing cocktails and you have yourself an amazing place for dinner.
Might not be the best place for a date as it is a little noisy but if you're looking for some delish Ramen and a cool spot to pop into for a bite - this is it! You won't regret it :)",1
1,"My order: tonkotsu ramen with corn.  What arrived: tonkotsu broth, trimmings, no noodles, no corn.  I try the broth and am pretty disappointed that it doesn't really taste much like tonkotsu.  But hey what do you expect outside of Japan.  Fine.  As I get about 4 spoonfuls in, the staff realize that they've botched the order and rush to take away the noodle-free ""ramen"" assuring me that a replacement will be right out.  It never comes.  15-20 minutes later...bowls destined for other patrons go by again and again...we have to leave or risk being late to our appointment.  So, I ended up with no lunch at all.  Average food.  Abysmal service.",-1
2,"Heard so many good things about Bone Daddies and I am always in search of good ramen in London... honestly, quite disappointed.  We ordered the tonkotsu ramen to test out the broth.  How disappointing! The broth was very bland, it doesn't taste like the 20 hour pork broth it claims to be on the menu.  It's also covered with a lot of oil.  Just a reflection of what a long way we are from having authentically good ramen and an appreciation for proper ramen here.  The only good dish we had for the night was the pork bones, covered with a sweet sesame sauce, it was delicious but the portion is a bit on the small side.  Then we also had the black sesame soft icecream, which was ok but a bit too sweet.  They really should work on their broth.  Now that I  have gone to the holy trinity of ramen - bone daddies, shoryu and tonkotsu, i have to say tonkotsu is the most balance and has the best broth.  Still a long way to go London!
I did notice at Bone Daddies that they provide you with rubber band to tie your hair up while you are working on your noodles, a nice touch!!",-1
3,"My girlfriends and I have decided to do a monthly noodle get together - Luckily one of them in a Hong Kong native and major London foodie so we are all setup for a mouth-tastic adventure.She had the idea of us checking out Bone Daddies as this is the new ""it"" spot for Ramen in the city.  We got there around 6:30PM knowing they don't take reservations. They were nice enough to take my word that my two friends were on our way and sat me down ahead on stools in the back.  That being said, I see the merits in waiting for the full party to be there as the two guys in front of me said they had a table for 10 and took up one of the coveted tables, only to have 6 in their party ultimately arrive - leaving us in the kind of awkward side by side seating in the back where it's a bit difficult to get your stuff together and have a dinner conversation. The staff, though, was quite friendly and accommodating even the small space.
But anywho, on to the food - 
The starts 
Appetizer: Fried chicken: Delicious  - A must order. I wouldn't have even thought to order this at a Japanese restaurant but you won't be disappointed - it's perfectly crispy, comes with a squeeze of lemon and really hits the spot - perfect for sharing.
Yellowtail sashimi - Fresh and delicious - a nice compliment to the added fried chicken calories!
I went for the Sweet 3 Miso Ramen and...eh. I mean, don't get me wrong it was good as Ramen - the broth was hearty and the noodles were right on but as toppings and meat go, I just needed more to offset the saltiness of the broth.",-1
2,"I love the broth. I am a huge fan of Bone Daddies. However, I went in for lunch today and ordered the Tantanmen 2, my favourite one, and then once I realised I couldn't finish this incredibly rich, chicken bone fat infused amazingness, I asked for a take-away box. I was then refused a take-away box. Here are the reasons why:
(apparently)
: there is no room for take away boxes (really?)
: they would have to allocate another layer of operations to justify having a service to do take-away boxes (that doesn't really make sense, but okay)
: it's wasteful of packaging, more so than actually chucking away half of a ramen bowl
(despite having wooden chopsticks instead of reusable ones, but ok)
: one can't control the experience of the ramen if it's boxed up and sent away with the customer who paid for it 
Anyway. All arbitrary reasons to me.  Look, if you want to have a new take on a non-native (aka the owner is not Japanese) in an international city like London, you make allowances like offer tupperware for those who would like to continue experiencing your delicious product. None of the reasons the owner presented as justifications for not offering a take-home option were air tight. The basic answer was, 'We just don't want to. And the customer can f*£$ off.' Fair enough.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm going to Tonkatsu next time.",-1
5,So delicious! The menu is limited but you really can't go wrong with a ramen-only specialty restaurant. Can't wait to come back!,1
3,My first review...  Just ok. Not too bad. Kinda disappointing when you've had really good ramen in Japan or SF or LA or NY. The noodles are too thin also (at least for my taste).,-1
5,"I dream about this place and if I wasn't living an ocean away I'd go there every week. Their ramen is all superb, all of it - I hallucinate about their spicy peanut broth - and the broccoli, fried chicken and black sesame soft serve are all essentials as well. A must-visit for London ramen lovers.",1
4,Best ramen broth I've had in London (although slightly on the salty side).  That is pretty much the most important thing when it comes to Ramen.,1
3,"The name kind of grosses me out for some reason, but that's irrelevant. The ramen is pretty good but I found the soup slightly too salty for my liking. For what you get it is slightly too pricey in my opinion but the atmosphere is buzzing and it does pretty well at distracting you from the perpetual drizzly greyness.",-1
1,"Was excited to check this place out. After a 45min wait for a single serving of ramen, I was served a horrible, lukewarm soup as I was getting ready to leave. I though I'd waited that long, I might as well try the ramen. Lukewarm tonkotsu is not nice. Neither is the tough-as-old-boots chashu pork on top. I have a strong feeling they made my serving and forgot about it for 20min, despite me asking the waiter a few times why it was taking so long.
Then they had the nerve to add a service charge.",-1
5,Easily the best ramen I've had in London to date. The 20 hour pork broth was awesome. The food easily made up for the poor service,1
4,"After walking up and down London's sad excuse for a Chinatown section unable to really find anything too interesting (and Yelp wasn't much help),  Yelp pointed me to this great ramen place.  It seems to be fairly new to the area.  I hate to use the word ""unctuous"" but I think it's the perfect description for this ramen.  Definitely a must try in Soho.",1
4,Excellent. Definitely worth the queue. Remember to try the fried chicken and also the soft shell crab. The ginger and lime sauce is almost as good as the crab itself. Broths are thick and rich and always benefit from chilli sauce in my opinion. Will be working my way through the whole menu in due course.,1
5,"Hands down, among the best ramen I've ever had.
It's really hard for me to say this, especially because I am notorious among my friends and family as being obscenely picky when it comes to food. But I have yet to experience a ramen that could match or best this place. Even Samurai Mama's in Brooklyn, Minca in Alphabet City, and the best Japanese places from the East Village, San Francisco, and Los Angeles were nearly as good as this place.
The one catch - it is expensive. And crowded.
However, there is something to be said about walking into a Japanese spot when you're not anywhere near Japan and seeing that it is packed with all the hip young, tattooed Japanese urbanites, Japanese yuppies and bankers as well as smiling young Japanese girls with their big cameras and little purses. This is the place for you.",1
5,"Helpful staff, friendly and on their game, quick to fix mistakes and help with anything and everything. Food is great quality and innovative. Always a good atmosphere and cool place to eat",1
5,Great atmosphere and ramen w pork was incredible.,1
5,So great! I thought I was back in Japan...amazing place...very busy...shame that the people who work there are NOT Japanese!! didn't seem AS authentic in that sense!,1
2,"Came at 6.30 on a Sunday night when it was busy but there was no wait. Staff are friendly and efficient. Room is buzzy. We were disappointed by the ramen having tried the two tantanmen variants. The soup was thick but a bit bland and heavy on peanuts which added an unwelcome sweetness and starchiness. Missed the savoury umami that's really important in any noodle soup. The noodles didn't hold their texture very well either. Soft shell crab was OK but nothing special. Would definitely recommend Shoryu over Bone Daddies for its more subtle soup, noodles with better bite and excellent range of sides. Altogether better as evidenced by the preponderance of Japanese diners (compared with Soho hipsters).",-1
5,"The tonkotsu ramen was delicious. Hit all the right notes. The standouts are the rich, creamy, savoury broth (nicely balanced with a bit of fresh ginger), and that egg.....man that egg. I'm already plotting my next return. If my husband can't make it, I'll come back solo. That's how much I want it.  I had amazing, memorable ramen in Tokyo years ago, but sadly lots of mediocre bowls in the years since, but the tonkotsu ramen at Bone Daddies put my taste buds right back in that happy place.",1
3,"I miss living in Japan. I miss it so much, this was my second ramen outing in one week. The first to Shoryu, the second to Bone Daddies. The atmosphere in Bone Daddies is more hip than a typical ramen shop, but it's tightly packed. Which means there is a lot of rubbing of butts...not as bad as riding the JR Yamanote line in rush hour in Tokyo, but pretty close. Though, the communal seating and bar seating is good for dining out by yourself or if you come with friends. Well, good luck finding seats on a weekend night if you have friends. The place fills up fast. However, I was seated within a few minutes since I was by myself.
I had the Tonkotsu ramen, and I have to say, I do prefer Shoryu's ramen...in egg, broth, noodles, the whole package. Bone Daddies is good, but I prefer Shoryu. Bone Daddies does have some fine, fine fried chicken (kara age).  Everyone around me was eating the soft-shelled crab, and seeming to enjoy it. And there were some cute waiters....just saying. All the waitstaff is really attentive and pretty fun.
The highlight of my outing was watching some chick curl up the ramen noodles with the chopsticks and the soup spoon like it was spaghetti. B****, please, that's not how you eat ramen!!! The hair ties on the table are so you can get you hair out of the way while you slurp it down! 
Well, in the end, glad I tried, but I prefer Shoryu's ramen, especially their egg. Price is similar, but I think Bone Daddies may be a few pounds more expensive. I wish I could put my finger on exactly why I prefer Shoryu, but I think it's worth trying both places for yourself.",-1
3,"Good Tonkotsu, thats all I know, good amount of pork, tender noodles, array of condiments including a garlic press and bulbs! Negatives: served slightly cold, service slightly inattentive. Not sure if its good value for money. However it really is tasty and there is a lovely fresh ginger taste that cuts through what is sometimes a rather rich and cloying dish.",-1
3,"i been to many Donkotsu ramen place in japan, paris and london.
I wantied to find the most nearest donkotsu ramen with original japanese one.
Obviously here is one of the best in london.  Very tender and well made cha-shu makes customer happy. And the quality and taste of Donkostu soup is good. Deep and long time boiled. However, when i was served, noddle and soup was nt hot . it was served with warm-cold. I was disappointed. Evenmore, the combination of topping and soup anf noodle is not good. Separately its good taste though, Too lack of ginger, not hot soup, and lack of bean sprouts. all together its disapointing for me. Because it served as warm-cold, the taste of soup is more greasy. 
 As a big fan of Donkostu ramen, im disappointed, but Still one of the best ramen spot in london. I tried Ittenbari, Nagomi,, ect, Bone daddie is one of best. I want to try Chiken Gara-age. For donkotsu gourmet, its bit disapointed but still one of the place for reducing thirsty for japanese dish.",-1
5,The broth is very delicious here. It is not hard to make but not everyone can prepare it the way I like it. Here they manage to do it the way I think it should be done. GReat place.,1
4,"I had the fried chicken and tonkatsu ramen.  The chicken was really good.  Perfectly crispy and not oily at all.  The ramen was also very good but different than what I'm used to.  I've never had such a rich broth.  I liked it, as the flavor was very deep, but warning it's much more filling than typical ramen!  I only ate about half after having the chicken.  I liked the concept of the egg (hard boiled but the broth somehow infused into it) but found it a little too salty.  I will go back again and make sure I'm super hungry this time.",1
4,"Popped in here late last night after reading about it in Chowhound.  Bone Daddies is a spartan but very compelling bistro with shared tables and very open vibe.  As other yelpers have alluded to, they specialize in ramen noodles.  I started with the fried chicken which was fantastic, not greasy and very crispy.  The white meat was tender and juicy; I would think of them as more chicken morsels than traditional fried chicken.  Then I ordered the tonkatsu ramen.  The noodles were perfect, not too soft, with a certain amount of bite.  The eggs were extraordinary and the meat perfect.  My only complaint was the broth had been reduced for 24 hours, so it more resembled a thin gravy.  Personally, I like broths a bit less thick, but it was still very very good.  The service was friendly and nice.  I'm definitely going back.",1
5,"the environment is nice, it needs a long time to enjoy the meal. Every plate is delicate and delicious, the dessert is so great, and the cocktail has a lot of flavors in it, it's beautiful.",1
4,"The original Hakkasan on Hanway Place gives sexy cool a whole new meaning. The entrance is a bit hidden in the corner but once you locate the bouncer at the door, the location is easily given away.  We arrived at 8:30 on a Sunday night and the place was hopping. You have to make your way down a dark staircase to the Uber cool cavernous space which opens up to a giant multi-room restaurant with super high ceilings and very minimalist and tasteful decor. The bathrooms are so well hidden the panel doors look like part of the wall. They're very beautiful inside once you find them! 
We made our way to the bar for a cocktail after we requested a table with side by side seating (which they were happy to accommodate with a modest wait). The bartender has apparently been with the hakkasan family for 8 years starting in Abu Dhabi and now taking up residence at the original london location. He informed us that despite the crowd we were seeing that evening that this was a particular quiet night and that the place is usually so packed that the wait at the bar can be quite long. We opted for the London only cocktails specifically the Tusan Fizz  and Mountain Peak. Watching the bar tender make these cocktails was like watching an artist at work.. and they were just as tasty as they were beautiful. 
We decided to try the three style mushrooms and the London only spicy okra for our vegetarian dishes. We also ordered the spicy prawns. But the two stars without question were the crispy duck salad and the sweet and sour pork....omg...heaven on a plate. 
The desserts at our neighboring table looked elaborate and yummy but we were so full. The service here was so wonderful. We chatted with several servers during the course of our meal and they were attentive, friendly and doting without being overbearing. 
We loved this place so much we vowed to try the NYC location as soon as we return stateside. And we will be making our way there with very high expectations in just a few weeks! 
From what I understand the newer Mayfair location in London has parking and is busier than this one, but there's something about this venue that just oozes ""trendy"" and the mystique is just hard to replicate.",1
5,Try the pecking duck. The cocktails are delicious. Service is impecable and ambience is very cool. A bit pricey but worth the trip.,1
3,"The place is always on high demand... food is ok, nothing spectacular. The duck which looks huge ends up been served in tiny portions and you are left wondering wheres the rest of the meat??? Anyways, fun to go with friends, more like a bar.",-1
5,"Get ready for some surprising news: Hakkasan is awesome.  Does that just blow your mind?   Well, it just us.  The only surprising thing really, is that it only has 4 stars currently.   What more do you want from a Chinese restaurant?  I guess maybe it's the price that puts people off, which is admittedly eye watering.  However everything is near perfect: food, ambiance, service, drinks.  All from the top drawer.  
Here is a top tip for you: go for lunch.   The tasting menu is £38 and you get dim sum, a main, sides, a drink.    What could go wrong?",1
4,"All of the food that we had was absolutely amazing. Was disappointed that the bartenders were unable to make a good dry, dirty martini. I mean, we are in London after all.  Unbelievable whiskey collection.  This easily would've been 5 stars but for the constant techno pulse music. I know I am not in my 20s more, but the constant...bump, bump, bump of the music was like a bad 90's venue.",1
5,"I was a bit apprehensive throughout the evening to come to this place and try the food here. It was our wedding anniversary and didn't want any thing to go wrong.
Oh boy! This place is amazing. It is not like any other Michelin star restaurant - there is loud music, fabulous drinks, dim-lit and you have to talk out loud. 
Away from the hustle-bustle of the street noise, we were led by a lady staff to the bar since our we were before time. The bar has an amazing collection and cocktails are delicious. After a wait of 20 minutes, we were taken to our table.We ordered a festive menu including dimsums, and salad, plain rice, chicken, prawns and honey lamb, and finally, dessert. The food were delicious, we enjoyed our time together. The staff is extremely good and they know how to make it special for their customers. Highly recommended.",1
5,"Had dinner there on Sunday evening, the combination of good cuisine and a relaxed....rather intimate atmosphere, the hall was dark, but at the same time a lot  of people revive the atmosphere of romance... quite busy place in the evening....
Roasted Silver cod was come with too sweet souce..as for me..
A wonderful dessert ""The emperor garden"", I highly recommend....",1
4,"Good dim sum place in London! I had it once in NYC and The consistency is there! I still not sure whether I can appreciate price tag that much! Don't get me wrong, it's a great presentation and service place! Just hard to beat home style dim sum!",1
5,"Amazing place
Amazing atmosphere
Amazing service
I'm a huge Hakkazan fan in every country they have their restaurant. but the Hanway Place give love to their concept for the Cantonese cuisine.
The Michelin star it's really deserved!
Th dim sum is the best I ever had. Be sure to order for the supreme platter. It worth.
Then we had the chili prawn. A bit too spicy but the prawns were outstanding
And for the grand finale duck with tartufo sauce!
It's our last night in London but can't wait to be back.",1
5,"Hakkasan is one of those places that just has ""IT.""  It is kind of hidden down an alleyway off the main road.  A woman at the door checks your name and then sends you in and down the stairs.  There is a little bit of smoke and incense on the walk down and it just adds to the aura.  
You are met downstairs by a hostess who checks your coat, and if the table isn't ready, escorts you to the bar.  We only waited a few minutes before our table was ready and we were seated.  Our server took our drink orders and got us on our way.
The menu is huge.  Really huge.  We decided our best bet was to order several small items and get a broader taste of what Hakkasan has to offer.
We went with the Supreme Dim Sum Platter, Crispy Duck Roll, Morel Mushroom and Vegetable Spring Roll, and the Jasmine Tea Smoked Organic Pork Ribs.  
The Supreme Dim Sum Platter is amazing.  The presentation was outstanding.  The platter came with eight dumplings total.  It consisted of two each of the following: gold leaf lychee and lobster, abalone and chicken shumai with caviar, Royal King Crab jade, and black truffle and Dover sole.  I wish I could do the taste of the these dumplings justice with my words but I just don't possess the vocabulary.  It was flat out absolutely delicious.  
The duck roll, spring roll, and pork ribs were also extremely tasty.  You can't go wrong with any of these orders.
The place is a bit loud so be prepared to speak up and have an amazing experience at Hakkasan!",1
5,"So ok, this is probably the best dim sum you can get in London.  However, they are on the pricey side so be prepared to pay more than your normal cheaper dim sum place like Oriental or Royal China (best 2 cheap dim sums).  And their dim sum are served in odd number of 3 as oppossed to the normal 4.  Which also shows how pricey they are.  That's said, it is by far the best dim sum you can get in London.  Try not to go there for the normal Chinese food as they are just OK and they are cheaper elsewhere.  Just come for the dim sum on weekend and on Sunday, I believe they have the dim sum menu for brunch so only go for this if you want.  If you go on other weekday dinner, their dim sum is extremely limited and only for appetizer (unless they have changed this but I encourage you to check the time they will serve their extensive list of dim sum.  Cocktails here are great too as they have asian flavours in them.",1
5,"The only Michelin-starred restaurant we have been to in London has been Barrafina, but a year or two before they were actually rewarded a star (I know, so much foresight). So it seemed to me that not having eaten at one before we leave for good would be a mark on our soul, so I looked up...Yahuatcha...due to my own love for dimsum. But after perusing through their menu, I became unsure as to whether there would be a marked difference between the dimsum there vs the dimsum i might find at Jade Garden in Chinatown, aside from the prices and ambiance. 
And then I perused the menu at Hakkasan. And then I couldn't decide. And then I consulted my college roommate who's been Yahuatcha and didn't see a huge difference and i was still in indecision..until i found that Hakkasan has a tasting menu of  £38 which included a cocktail, an app, main, and dessert (per person). It also came with rice and stir-fried asparagus during the main, which i did not expect.
This cheap tasting menu is only available before 6pm Sundays to Thursdays or something (can't remember the details) and not advertised in the restaurant. Although we specifically made a booking for that menu, when they seated us, they did not provide us with it and we had to ask for it in the dim dim underground lighting. The servers when we asked, also told us that we likely will not be full from the menu but we were undeterred.
The cocktails were so good. And the food was even better. I was really surprised because my expectations were really low - believing that Chinese food is just Chinese food, but they made it better! Rather than explosion stir-fried wok heat flavours, the food is more delicate and nuanced. 
After the dimsum platter, wasabi fried shrimp, duck, cod, and asparagus, the server was right, we were still hungry so we added some ribs from the a la cart menu. Holy the rib was the BEST. And then dessert was so good too. We walked away about £100 lighter in our bank account, but it was actually worth it. 
I'm looking forward to coming back again.",1
4,"In short:
4 stars for food
2 stars for service
We came here for my husband's birthday as he loves asian/chinese food.
I thought they had a michelin star but I think it's only the mayfair branch that does, which may explain the sub-par service.
Anyway, we arrived and were escorted to the bar which is pretty cool. Took a while to get served for drinks but when we did they were very good.
We were then seated at our table. It's a busy, vibrant dining experience so don't come here for a quiet romantic dinner. It's cool though and I liked the vibe.
To start I had the veggie dim sum platter which was huge and very tasty. For my main I had the crispy fresh water prawn with dried chilli and cashew nut which was amazing. A mix of beautifully crispy prawns with whole dried chillis and nuts. Honestly loved it (as did my husband). 
However, our waitress was pretty terrible. She was rude and spoke limited english (I think she was eastern european) and not very accommodating. This may have just been bad luck but I was not impressed. I think partly this was because I was expecting michelin star service so maybe service is better at the mayfair branch.
I would go back, despite the price, because the food is great.",1
5,"FABULOUS
This is a truly great restaurant. The style of food is called ""Modern Chinese,"" and as that implies they take liberties with the classic style and present avant-garde dishes. I went with my granddaughter for their Sunday brunch and we both enjoyed a wonderful meal. One of our favorite dishes was the Crispy Duck Salad, but we also liked the Steamed Dim Sum Platter and the Fried and Baked Platter. The Jasmine Tea Smoked Organic Pork Ribs and the Grilled Chilean Sea Bass were also excellent.
We left very happy and well satisfied with the meal and the value as well.
Any complaints? Well, to be completely honest, the service for us was merely 4 stars. No one waitperson took responsibility for our table and the appearances by various individuals were impersonal with rote presentations. Although the servers were rather pleasant and no doubt knowledgeable, we had no Asian servers and they seemed to be mostly Eastern European with heavy accents that were a bit difficult to understand.",1
5,"'Value for money' are 3 words you probably weren't expecting to see in a Hakkasan review (unless preceded by 'good luck getting your') but if you can get there by 6.30pm for dinner then congrats you're in luck!
They serve a 'Taste of Hakkasan' menu of three courses and a cocktail for £35 per person - it's tasty, filling and a steal for the price. A friend and I had a catch-up there after work to treat ourselves, and were given a wonderfully polite welcome from the start with no sign that we were there for last orders from the cheapo menu.
The only choice you need to make is meat, fish or veg - my mate and I went fish and meat respectively and shared which was perfect. We both enjoyed our Ling Ling Collins and a trio of dim sum to start - har gau classic, scallop and something yummy with chives. Her aubergine and shiitake salad then arrived but I think we were both more excited by my jasmine tea smoked organic pork ribs. I couldn't taste the tea per se but they tasted delicious with a good amount of meat on them. I liked the nice touch of slicing up the rack at the table and the way they kept it classy by serving them with finger bowls. My main was a generously sized spicy prawn dish, though this time I liked my mate's grilled seabass and honey better. We finished with a delectable trio of macarons in espresso, matcha green tea and passionfruit flavours which (unusually) I could barely finish.
The restaurant had gradually filled up around us and it was only on the walk to the toilets that I realised quite how big the place is. The low lighting keeps it feeling intimate while you're seated though, and combined with plenty of dark sexy decor and how beautifully the food is presented I think this would be a good date place. Go between 5.30-6.30pm or after 10pm for the set menu and you can impress them with your savvy bargain-hunting skills too!",1
4,"Would go back here just for the atmosphere- heard that the HongKong mafia frequents this place and the vibe certainly attests to that lol. This is a great place to get drinks and their dimsum, whilst expensive, is exquisite and delicious.",1
4,The dumplings were good. The rest of the food okay I think Hakassan is for duck lovers and I am not. But Rihanna was Seating next to us and having diner. So you basically get a nice atmosphere and an okay good. I wouldn't go to hakassan if I am starving I would go to mr chow but I definitely would go there if I look hot and need to go out .,1
5,"Hakkasan is far from being the new kid on the block, making its bold debut back in 2001 it was full of Eastern promise. Fast forward 15 years and this kid has still got style. Hakkasan is a gorgeous space, the dark interior with well placed spot lights, delicate gold tapestry, plump noir pillows and pattern carved screens to section off the room and enhance the intimate feel.
Hakkasan is special. You should make an effort to go as its interior will certainly upstage you. Glam, classy and stylish is what you should go for as its a place to celebrate. Beautiful place, food, drink and people. With all this effort on the packaging, what does the content have in store? Well follow me on my birthday dinner journey and you will see. 
We selected a ""Tast of Hakkasan"" menu for £38 per person. It included a three course meal and cocktail. Value money if i do say so myself and as we roll on, it will become clear why. My cocktail of choice was the Lychee Martini which was absolutely delicious. No scrimping on the Vodka, you could taste the Belvedere. Sam Vanilla, my birthday host, had the Hakka, a mix of vodka, sake, lychee, lime, coconut and passion fruit. Cocktail are a thing at Hakkasan. For years I have heard how amazing they are and they were not a disappointment. 
As we started our michelin star dining experience, it was a dims sum platter and crispy squid with avocado mustard dressing and caramilised walnut to start. The dim sum selection was a medley of colours and gorgeous ingredients. I tasted king prawn, shitake mushrooms and much more. A delicate devil of a starter! Sam Vanilla loved her subtly coated squid with the right balance between crispy and tender.
We settled on a meat feast for our mains with black truffle roasted duck and tea plant mushroom. Wow, truffle is my favourite so the aroma was very tempting. Unfortunately this was not my main choice, so i had to do with a cheeky little fork full of meat and pat the truffle filled air into my direction. I tried something a little different with the wok-fried lamb in a spicy mint sauce. I hit the jack pot too as the lamb was amazing. To describe the food is near impossible as it really is a food journey of loveliness. The sides comprised of baby crunchy asparagus and sticky rice. Again, no taking the eye off the ball, even for the accompaniments. I was truly delighted with this place as a birthday treat! A big thank you to Sam Vanilla, but also a big thank you to Hakkasan for standing the test of time.
Now it was time for the dessert. Not being one to have a sweet tooth, it was a stab in the dark for me. I was delighted when my milk chocolate, hazelnut praline and rice krispies Jivara bomb arrived. There it was, the wee birthday candle and a message on my plate. Lovely. The bomb was heavenly. Sam Vanilla had the lemon and sesame tart with candied lemon and meringue. A picture of perfection and zest filled dream.",1
5,"I love this restaurant. I went there for my birthday about five years ago, and returned again recently for a special night out. Both times were exquisite experiences - and I use the word experiences, not meals, because this is exactly what separates a good from an outstanding restaurant: attention to detail and the crafting of a dining experience, rather than a focus solely on great food. It's rare that you find such an upscale, modern, sensual and trendy dining experience centered around traditional Cantonese food. Thank goodness they haven't taken the ""Asian fusion"" route (one that almost unfailingly results in quality reduction). 
The restaurant is down a dark alleyway off Oxford Street. Think James Bond, sexy spy movies, understated luxury. You would assume you were gaining entry into a secret celebs-only club, not a Michelin-starred restaurant. Down the stairs you go, your interest piqued and your excitement growing. The entryway will not disappoint. The interior was designed by the set director of the film The Matrix, and it's stunning. The intricate woodwork, lighting, bustle, aromas, ambiance...all are intoxicating and immediately provide respite from the stressful streets of London. Beautiful people, beautiful food, beautiful bar. 
I remembered specifically the heavenly texture of the silver cod on the menu, so wanted to make sure we ordered it this time. Because of the tantalizing selections on the menu (lovely cocktail list too), we decided to go with a Signature Tasting Menu for 60 pounds per person. We got a dim sum sampler, some of the most flavorful smoked pork ribs I've ever had, and an array of entrees that lived up to my expectations (what a relief). The silver cod was just as perfectly cooked, tender, moist and slippery as I remembered it from the past. The Angus beef stir fry, vegetables and prawn dishes were also amazing. Service was flawless. My husband commented on how it was one of the best dinners he'd had in some time, and how surprising it was that this was Chinese food.....
The clientele here is a mixture of people celebrating special occasions and smartly dressed businessmen and women having work networking dinners. The dining room seems to maintain that perfect equilibrium of gregarious but intimate. It's alluring AND trendy. Not sure how the place manages to keep the balance going, but it works and it's a wonderful escape. 
It's not cheap, but I highly recommend saving some money and time for an experience here if you can. Dress up, go balls to the wall, and have some fun.",1
5,This is probably the best meal I ever had ! Worth every penny ! Not a cheap place but if u had to choose where to spend some cash ! Don't hesitate at all . Every single meal ordered was to die for ! Every dish tasted superb ... I can't explain enough how good the food tastes . One thing for sure ... it's the best food I ever had .although I travel a lot! So far it's my number 1 . Thank u London,1
4,"Still good although from a high point of being excellent, it does feel like it is on the decline. 
 
The food almost feels like an after-thought to the booze. A high-end version of pork-scratchings complementing the high-end spirits.
 
The décor looks aged but is well hidden due to the minimalist lighting. I feel it is on the slow road the mediocrity.",1
4,"Really nice inside. Dark and moody and a little hidden away but I like that. Eventhough it's very close to the hustle of Oxford St.
All about the Dim Sum and some cocktails. Couldn't fault the taste and quality. Pricey but that is to be expected for the reputation you know you are getting.
Will be back for one of their deals they often have running like Dim Sum Sundays.",1
4,"My friend and I dined here and ordered the tasting menu.  IIRC it was something like 119 GBP/person.  With a bottle of wine, our bill was around 300 GBP so this was definitely a splurge meal for us.
The food was great though.  There was so much food we couldn't finish all of it but I tried everything.  The duck was great.
If I can afford it, I'd like to come back again...
I had a reservation at 7 and was told that we had the table until 9.  However, we didn't end up leaving until around 10 so I guess it was all good since we spent so much money here.
The location is a little tricky to find but google maps and such can lead the way.
It looks like it used to be a trendy bar/club type place but it's not quite as trendy anymore.  It was still pretty busy though.
Our waiter was good and attentive but was a little annoying and over the top saying things like ""Oh, this is my favorite dish in the entire world!"" and ""Excellent choice, that's my favorite"", etc.",1
3,"Hakkasan is one of those places that always makes top 10 lists, so this year for our anniversary, we thought we would try it. 
I tried the dim sum platter, and my favourite was the shimeji mushroom dim sum which was the best flavour of the night for me. The other dim sum were decent, but nothing really stood out and one amazing piece of dim sum doesn't qualify the entire platter.
The chicken corn soup was also not impressive, I have had better at Good Earth. It tasted mostly of chicken and not much else.
The pepper rib eye beef was really good though and had a lovely peppery aftertaste. I really enjoyed the tender pieces of beef and the yummy sauce they were in. The deep fried prawns were a bit too sweet for me, but my husband really liked them.  We also ordered Hakka noodles, which were thin noodles with great texture but very little flavour at all. They would be great to mix with a spicy sauce-y dish, but on their own they are pretty bland.
I was excited about the Michelin starred food and although everything was good, nothing really blew me away. It was like going to a good concert but with only low volume music. Perhaps if I had ordered more in a big group I might have been more impressed. The restaurant itself was nice, stylishly dim, but nothing special.
I have heard that the service is iffy, but our server was nice enough, although I was a bit worried that she was a robot sometimes. They even sent us a plate with happy anniversary written in chocolate and a scoop of lovely sorbet with graham cracker-y goodness, and we really appreciated the thoughtfulness.  I enjoyed the beef but I don't know if it's enough for me to go back, unless I was in a big group and could try a lot more.",-1
2,"Overpriced, too focussed on who is there, not enough focus on what is on the plate.
The staff all think they should be in that dreadful Chelsea television programme",-1
5,"I absolutely love Hakkasan!
I only visit on Saturday afternoons as they have a EXTENSIVE and very TASTY dim-sum menu for lunch.  I personally believe it is the best I've ever tasted.  To top it of they have stunning cocktails to compliment every dish.
The venue is spectacular and the staff cannot be better.",1
3,Heard so much about this place. Heard it was best Chinese in London. Well. Ambience was great. Music was repetitive and loud. Food was salty. No way the best Chinese I have had. Average at best,-1
5,"Everything we ordered were excellent! 
You must not miss the Dim Sum. The corn soup was fantastic.",1
5,"Came here for their Dim Sum Sundays as a way to celebrate turning in our dissertations and completing our Master's programmes. I'm super overdue in writing this as we came here last August and the menu has changed a bit. But it was the most perfect, delicious and relaxing lunch I've ever had. I can still remember it as if it was yesterday!
Besides the food I think a major draw of this place is the atmosphere. The restaurant is hidden away on a tiny side street and when you descend the dark stairs into a wide black-walled yet well lit room it feels very exclusive. The staff are very friendly and polite though I imagine more so when you have a reservation and know exactly what you're doing than if you just happen to wander in. Nevertheless we were well taken care of. We got a nice corner seat with a great view of the whole restaurant. And even though it started to fill up by the end of our meal, we had a sense of privacy the whole time.
I don't think my descriptions of our dim sum would do the food justice so I'll just say this; it was outstanding. Seriously one of the best meals of my whole life. I can't even decide which course was my favourite. Between the cocktails, the appetizers and main meal, to the desserts and the tea I was a huge fan of everything. And it was so beautiful! Nothing I enjoy more than food that is not only delicious but aesthetically pleasing as well. 
As far as I know this is one of many Hakkasan restaurants around the world. Now that I'm back in LA I can't wait to try the one here. I admit this is not a restaurant you go to when you're not a budget. But it's nice to splurge every once in a while. Treat yourself to a wonderful dining experience at Hakkasan. You won't be disappointed.",1
4,"Took my daddy for his 50th while in London!!
Great atmosphere..a bit noisy! Welcoming service.. Had cocktails at the bar while waiting on our table..cocktails were good! Although I did think a bit pricey which would be typical of a Michelin star restaurant in London!!
Food was amazing...we had two starters the squid & the duck!! Both lovely! Waiter was very attentive, pouring water & wine each time glass was low! Mains were both beef & both very very good..large portions & the rice was perfect!!
They even brought out a dessert for my daddy with happy birthday on it! Nice touch!
Would deffo book to go back again or better still try the sister restaurants that are scattered around the world!!",1
5,"If you like Chinese, you will love this place... and even if you don't like Chinese, you will do by the time you have visited here!
I must admit that I am not usually the biggest fan of Chinese, but I can honestly say that my meal at Hakkasan was one of the best meals that I have ever had. The food was absolutely out of this world. It's hard to put a finger on why it was just so good - but it really was! Tender, moist, flavorsome... just wow! I was really blown away.
Aside from the food, the service is good, the decor is Gothic nouveau and the pricing structure is certainly palatable. For those who have a little cash to spare, you can enjoy some delightful dishes that cost up to and over £300 a plate. For those that are on a tighter budget, you can go for the tasting menu at around £35 each. That is what we went for, and we certainly were not left feeling hungry at the end!
All in all, a superb restaurant. I wish I could give it 6 stars. I highly recommend it!",1
4,"The food and service is very good. The atmosphere is a bit hectic -- very loud and and busy. Not an amazing experience, so it was a bit disappointing.",1
2,"My friends and I decided to continue our girls dinners with an early dinner at Hakkasan mid week. We found a £35 Taste of Hakkasan menu, which includes 3 courses and a cocktail - not a bad offer! 
When arriving at the 'original' London Hakkasan off of Tottenham Court Road you go down a dark stairway, past the blue lit reception area, into a dark and moodily lit space with the bar at the back.
After a first cocktail at the bar we were shown to our table, they kinda squashed us in, but it was a nice round table.
We had Dim Sum and Crispy Duck Rolls for starters, then a choice of either Roasted Silver Cod, Pipa Duck (more crispy duck - I can't get enough of it!) or Stir Fry Black Pepper Rib Eye.
Desserts were selected from the full main menu - I can recommend the chocolate one!
So what's the verdict? 
The food looked & tasted amazing too, I was only uncertain about the sauce with the Roast Silver Cod, but that wasn't my dish!. Unfortunately the dinner was let down by the service. With a Michellin starred restaurant I expect a certain level, certainly not what we received.
Not only did we get told that the Taste menu wasn't for those that were hungry - a suggestion that we literally were not going to get enough food, but also the impression that we were being looked down on for choosing this option - staff repeatedly walked into me when serving or clearing the table (it's not that dark in there surely?!) and food didn't arrive at the table at the same time.
I can't excuse any of these issues when I've been to similar caliber restaurants (Roux at the Landau and Maze) on similar deals and been treated superbly, so this is something that Hakkasan should work on for all levels of client - not just those dropping £700 for dinner for two (true story, but it wasn't me!).
And the staff member was wrong - we had plenty of food and left feeling stuffed, especially after a pot of tea, post dessert.",-1
5,"I admit it was a selfish idea to bring my husband here for his birthday. We have both wanted to come here for ages but never seem to remember to, as its smack bang in the middle of Oxford Street/Tottenham Court Road. There is another Hakkasan in Mayfair but we wanted to try the original. We were staying at the Hoxton so we had a nice stroll to the restaurant for a pre dinner drink. Our table was ready for us so we had a couple of glasses of bubbles while we drooled over the menu.
So I'm incredibly greedy, especially so when it comes to eating Chinese. I pretty much wanted everything. My husband reassured me we would come again so that made making choices less fraught. 
So to start the dim sum platter and fried soft shell crab. The dim sum were a picture! Best har gau dumplings I've eve had. The scallop shumai was pretty special too. The soft shell crab was cooked to perfection, juicy and crisp.
For mains we had the claypot poussin, the black pepper rib eye with merlot and chilli morning glory with rice. The beef was incredibly tender, super tasty and I was sceptical about the merlot. The poussin was covered in an amazing sauce.
We were now faced with dessert. Part of me wanted to order more starters after seeing other dishes passing us by, in particular the prawn toast which looked epic! I always get food envy. I had a word with myself and we shared the apple tatin with coffee and jasmine tea.
It was a lovely evening and I can't wait to come back again.",1
5,"Delicious food + good service = good experience 
I believe it is Chinese fusion, but the food was surprisingly good. It's very expensive, but good for some occasions.",1
1,"This was a bitter disappointment. Had heard good things about the restaurant, however on arrival we found the place over booked. We were ushered into a cramped corridor of a bar, where aside from not being able to hear ourselves speak, we were unable to get to the bar as it was so crowded. The disappointing thing was that the bar was full of dissatisfied customers waiting overly long on their tables. Our 9 o clock table came at 9.40, after a huge amount of pestering of the overworked staff. 
The table we were given was so near the DJ that we couldn't hear, and the table was so dark we couldn't see. Typically, a second after opening the menu, a waiter impatiently asked if we has chosen, and we told him that with our senses so deeply inhibited, it was fairly difficult to discern your a** from your elbow, let alone chose food. In the end we left the restaurant without eating, as the place had the all the charm and character of a reversing dump truck with no tires on. 
It was a typical restaurant that was greedy- and overbooked hugely, and tried to be too cool. One doesn't go to one of the most expensive Chinese restaurants in the world to listen to repetitive and shoddy music from a low end DJ- in fact a DJ has little place in a restaurant at all. Put a candle on the table, and stop thinking your a hip place. You're not.",-1
5,The restaurant is beautifully decorated. Our server was very attentive. The cocktails are strong yet still taste good. Everyone says this but they have amazing dim sum. The crispy duck roll is really tasty. The grilled Chilean sea bass in honey was the best fish I have ever had. The stir fry Australian lobster was good (but maybe not quite worth the hefty price tag). All in all great experience.,1
3,"Fancy a luxury night out? Well good for you, but Hakkasan is probably not the way to go unless you don't mind spending an extravagant amount of money on good (but not great) food and don't mind sitting in the dark or being restricted to a 2hrs stay. Having been awarded a Michelin star, Hakkasan does seem self-indulgent with bouncers at the door, service that opens the door for you, takes your coat and bags away from you and is there at your beck and call. All this and yet the entrance looks like it is the entrance to a seedy nightclub, the decor within is dark and simple as if to hide the fact that they couldn't be bothered to inject some vibrant colour into the place and the seating is not only not that comfortable but the tables a quite close together so it is easy to see the food the people next to you are eating.
Nevertheless, the food and drinks are inoffensive and packed with a good variety of ingredients that you may never have tried before, the staff are well trained, and when they cook a chilli dish they don't hold back.",-1
4,"A special occasion treat of a meal tucked away in an otherwise nondescript off-shoot of Oxford St.  You enter amongst some incense burning and down some stairs, so they do a good job of making it feel like you're entering a new environment (rather than the back alley that it is).  The other aspect that we immediately noticed was the abundance of service staff; it felt more like a hotel check-in rather than a restaurant.  Suppose that's what you should expect form somewhere with a Michelin star!
Ambiance was dark wood everywhere, but lighting helped with that and set a nice mood.  The star of the show for me was the black truffle roasted duck, which was bursting with rich flavor.  It's not going to hit the spot if you're looking for a sweet taste, but rather the savoury flavour hits you right away.  The sweet and sour pork was also prepared well and was a good price compared to most of the other dishes on the menu (though probably not going to beat your local takeaway).  It gave us pause like 'What's the catch...', but no ill effects to speak of to date.
Definitely an occasion restaurant as it's quite pricey, but the service and quality of food seemed worthy of a Michelin star.",1
5,"This is one of my favourite restaurants in London, every plate combines taste with aesthetics and the preparations are always so colourful and good-looking.
Hakkasan is a well known name as it can be found all over the world. In London there are two restaurants, one in Fitzrovia and the other one in Mayfair. The style is nearly identical, consisting in wooden surfaces, glass panes and coloured lights; a cocktail bar, a low-lighting and intimate ambient with some music playing in the background.
This is probably one of the most popular restaurants within its category. In fact, people need to book their table some days in advanced since there is always a lot of people and it is very unlikely to ind a table without having a reservation.
Some of the dishes I suggest the most are the Crispy duck rolls and the Dim sum platter which are two of my favourite plates and I always get them when I go here.
If you like Chinese cuisine I strongly suggest you to check this out and maybe also let me know what you think about it. If you are more into Japanese food, there's also that! Always a part of the Hakkasan group, it is called Sake no Hana.
This is a review taken from my Travel blog which can be found here:

3,"This is essentially overpriced Asian food off Tottenham Court Road. I've been to both branches of Hakkasan in London and this is pales in comparison to Hakksan Mayfair in terms of service, food quality and also general decor. Even walking to HHP feels a little eerie given it's at the end of a dark side street. Unfortunately, the inside also suffers from the same poor lighting.
This is based on two different experiences from around two years ago as well as one last year (for the sake of clarity) and there are some good dishes on the menu but I've always felt underwhelmed and hungry when leaving. The drinks are average and truthfully, the first time I visited the waitress pretty much turned up her nose at two of my friends who are strict Jains and do not drink. For a Michelin starred Chinese restaurant this is disappointing both in terms of food and service. I live in Hong Kong now and have been to many other dim sum restaurants in London and although some of the dim sum on the weekend menu at Hakkasan are creative they do not justify the price tag in my opinion. The ambience at the other branch is much nicer and I've had better experiences with staff as well as enjoyed the food a little more. A quick tip - don't bring your own birthday cake unless you plan on also ordering dessert here, you will be charged a cake cutting fee per person.",-1
5,"Fun find for dim sum located in an alley out of the way.  The dining area is subterranean, dark, and mysterious that feels like a scene out of The Matrix or Bladerunner.  Fun, fruity cocktails and mocktails accompany the courses.  A few modern twists on traditional dim sum that keeps your palette guessing.  All of the waitresses are dressed in the same boldly colored dresses and perform with the demeanor of automatons.",1
5,"This was an amazing experience. From walking down the two flights of stairs to sitting down in the dimly lit but chicly decorated restaurant, it was a very complete experience. 
I ordered the vegetarian dim sum, which was probably some of the best, most flavorful dim sum I've ever had. There were 4 different types of dim sum in the bamboo container, and 2 of each type. For 11 pounds, this was a great value! It came out steaming hot, with a great texture. I think it had fake meat, vegetables and sauces, and the dim sum came with both soy sauce and spicy chile sauce. I definitely recommend this dish! If you're not too hungry, you can definitely order it as the main dish and split a side of rice.
There were 4 of us, and we shared a bowl of fried rice. This was only 5 pounds, and each person got a full bowl. I also tried my friend's vegetarian spicy black bean chicken and beans. This was delicious as well, and super flavorful. 
We finished with 1 dessert split between the 4 of us. We ordered the Javindra Dessert (or something like that), which is an ice cream chocolate mousse ball coated with a crispy layer and covered in dark chocolate, which they pour after setting it down on the table. It also has pop rocks on the side!
All in all, definitely coming back here!",1
4,"When I think of upmarket restaurants that fail to disappoint in London, this is (so far) pretty much the top of my list! 
Between the two of us we went for the £60pp signature menu:
Signature menu:
Dim sum platter
scallop shumai, har gau, Chinese chive dumpling 
and shimeji dumpling
Jasmine tea smoked organic pork ribs
Roast chicken in satay sauce
Pan-fried silver cod
Stir-fry black pepper rib eye beef with merlot
Spicy prawn
with lily bulb and almond
Seasonal vegetables
Steamed jasmine rice
We finished the meal off with the chocolate ganache with raspberry sorbet and salted caramel.
 
The decor and lighting was perfect, the food was even better than I'd imagined, and being able to share the signature menu meant we both got a taster of varied Hakkasan specialities without spending £££s.",1
5,"This is my first try of a michelin-starred Cantonese dim-sum restaurant, and it did pass my approval because the dim-sum was as good as the best I've had in Hong Kong and China. 
The quality of the shrimp dumpling especially, which for me is the best way to judge the quality of dim-sum ingredients, was incredible with its translucent skin and natural texture. The white bread of the barbecue pork bun was soft and light. 
Even though the prices are exorbitant because you can pay 1/4 of the price for the same quality in China, in London this will the best it gets for quality dim-sum along with a great atmosphere.",1
4,"You know you're in good hands when a Modern Chinese restaurant is a 1 Michelin Star. Amazing cocktails, amazing food and impeccable service. When you don't know what to get, the top 5 dishes are recommended by your waiter, and they do not disappoint. I was highly impressed, and I don't mind paying a hefty bill for 5 star food. Definitely recommend to all. Modern twist on Chinese food!!",1
3,"Excellent service and okay food. Service was as expected for a Michelin starred restaurant. We went on a Monday for lunch and it was dead but I would assume it gets quite packed at night. The restaurant interior is very trendy with a large bar.
Duck salad was the stand-out dish with crispy duck pieces complemented by pomelo and grapefruit to lighten it up.The grilled Shanghai dumplings really just looked like run of the mill pot stickers or gyoza. The crispy duck rolls were loaded with duck but when eaten without the sauce they lacked flavor.

3,"Food - 4.5 stars however all other ratings considerations drove my rating lower. So here's the scoop:
Food: wow - excellent meal.  I started with the vegetarian hot and sour soup. It was probably the best I have had - lots of flavor and no flavorless dollops of tofu. I had the Three Style Mushroom Stir fry. Normally, I would not select a mushroom only dish although I am a huge fungus fan - largely because I usually find the dishes to be uninteresting but I was intrigued given other menu selections and the restaurant's reputation. It was a good decision - the mushrooms were amazingly flavorful with just the right sauce. My date selected the dim sun option as an appetizer and the stir fry peking duck. Both were very good. Ordering brown rice as an accompaniment must not be common as instead of a substitution for white rice, I got a huge bowl of it and it cost an additional 8 pounds. 
And here was the downside:
Service: ...was uneven, and not just a little uneven. We had good service at the bar where service was efficient. I was especially impressed with the well chilled glass in which my date's vodka martini was delivered - perfect!  However service went downhill once we were seated. We dined downstairs. It appeared that the waitstaff was assigned to a section and our waitress was challenged with keeping up with orchestrating the meal. She would disappear for a while and appear at times when we weren't ready. The addition of a second person to take our drink order was poorly coordinated and he did not seem to be very interested in his job nor in our requests. He wasn't interested in explaining the wine list; he plunked our drinks down as if he couldn't wait to leave. We waited an inordinate amount of time to get our bill as well. 
In addition, the wine list was terrible! It wasn't organized by varietal nor region, nor even flavor profiles. Instead, it was a weird mix of selections under topics such as ""Classics: Fine Wines with History"" (most wines have history and nobody offered to provide the history nor was it explained in the list), ""Vielles Vignes: old vines"" (NOT all French and old vines is an undefined designation) and ""Purity: the expression of the fruit"" (huh?!). I love my wine and I love to peruse a good wine list.  The Hakkasan wine list was just painful and its organization made it impossible to make a selection.  It was so poorly organized that we gave up on finding something and ordered cocktails.
Prices were really high. I could chalk this up to it being London and London prices but the prices were over the top.
Before leaving, I stopped at the bathroom and met another American while washing my hands.  We looked at each other and almost simultaneously said ""Weird"".",-1
5,"Amazing restaurant, the athmosphere is great and the food phenomenal. It does not just taste great but it looks amazing.",1
4,"This review is for the sunday dim sum menu.
Started off with an excellent gin based cocktail. They sat us down and explained the menu to us. The first course was a crispy duck salad. This was amazing how the flavor of the duck and the crispness came together in your mouth. I wish they had brought more. 
Then came out 8 different dim sum dumplings in all. Generally typical (prawn Pork etc) but what stood out to me was the venison. However I wish I had used more pepper sauce on these. 
Next was our appetizer course- since we ha four people we ordered both the squid and the vegetable. Both were crispy. 
I should mentioned that during the meal we had champagne being poured for us the whole time. Not fancy bottles but still very tasty. Went well with meal. 
Finally the mains came and we were getting full. But alas we enjoyed the Seabass and the lamb. The Seabass was a bit fishy tasting (it is fish) but seared well. The lamb was tender but needed more flavor. The fried rice wasn't special but the Bol Chou was good. 
After this feast we thought we were finished. But alas after a brief period of rest came dessert. The rest of the table ordered the chocolate sphere thing which crackled in your mouth. Really good with the chocolate sauce poured over it. I however went or the macaroons. Always tasty. Did I mention we also got a dessert cocktail? I got a whiskey one which was quite a nice ending and I thought went well with the macaroons. 
All in all a great value for Michelin star food. It took all afternoon an was a great opportunity to spend time with friends. Some of the flavor a could have been stronger. Lastly wish it wasn't in the basement but I think it's part of the desired atmosphere",1
4,"The dim sums were good, but the main course was just average. The ambiance and drinks were good. Have been at Hakkasen at other locations, but the food is always a hit or miss.",1
3,"A friend and I went here for the Sunday three course special. The service was impeccable, and all of the food was perfectly cooked. However, the dishes lacked imagination and complexity. The flavor profile was pretty flat. We're from Indiana and joked that their bland dishes would be perfect for the Midwest. Do not expect anything here like the creative dishes of, say, a Gymkhana or Buddakan.",-1
5,As good as the Hakksan from SF and Vagas :)  It' s hidden in hard to find place tho :),1
3,"I was really looking forward to this place, and the food was definitely good, but it was incredibly expensive for what we were served. My husband and two kids spent $300 on lunch (lunch!) and the food was good but didn't blow me away. I don't spend that kind of cash to have a decent lunch.",-1
2,"I had reserved a table for two, mentioning a birthday as occasion. Seriously, we felt we received the worst table in the house, next to the cashiers desk. We refused to sit there and were seated to a very nice table right away. 
It all went downhill from there. 
The service was pestering us the whole time, pushing and pushing and pushing. We felt they wanted us out as soon as possible. This is what ruined it for me. Management should have a look at that. But why really, when all table are taken always. 
The food: I ask myself how they received a Michelin star! 
I had the Dim Sum platter and Green tea smoked chicken. What comes, is the bare chicken. Rice and vegetables need to be ordered seperately. Which feels like a joke to me. 
The food tasted good. That`s it! Seriously my lunch-chinese in Hamburg offers the same taste for 10 EUR. And I make the same morning glory at home. No special twist, no interesting aroma, no nothing.
The noise level is overwhelming. 
This was so ridiculous.
How can all these people think that this is the best food they ever had? This is a mystery to me. 
I admit, the interior is spectacular. And that was worth seeing. But that was the only thing that I didnt fall into depression when leaving. 
It was so not worth it. Sadly it was my birthday. We should have gone to Muriels Kitchen across from the Ampersand Hotel instead. And would have had a fab time.
Think twice before you come here. There are far better options in London.",-1
4,"A real dining experience with a subtle and contemporary take on Chinese food. The interior paves way for a relaxed atmosphere with clever use of lighting and partitioning to give you that private and exclusive dining experience.
We ordered a selection of dishes from throughout the menu, sharing and discussing amongst us in the traditional Chinese way of eating. The vegetarian and meat dim sum platters were generous enough with the prawn dim sum offering an amazing mix of texture and a fresh prawn flavour. In addition the stick tea ribs were amazing and again came in an ample portion. 
For mains, we ploughed through a variety of dishes including vegetarian (of which there is a great selection) and unanimously came to a decision that the sea bream with champagne and honey sauce was utterly memorable. 
For desert I would most definitely recommend the chocolate bomb and a nice selection of macaroons. 
Overall, I would highly recommend this place as an dining experience that can see you lost from the outside world for a number of hours whilst you enjoy the many wonderful flavours of Asian cuisine.",1
3,"Based on the cheaper £35 taste of Hakkasan menu, this place isn't bad.  Considering a cocktail is over £10 and you get one, plus dim sum, a main and a dessert the deal is pretty good. 
It's kind of classy in a 90s kind of way, it's dark and modern but at the same time it feels a bit bit dated for some reason.  Service was good and the atmosphere was good, food was ok. 
Comparing it to the best Chinese, the dim sum was a nice modern twist in terms of flavour but the steamed dim sum's pastry was too thick and floury, and the balance of the filling in the duck spring roll wasn't quite right.  
The beef in Merlot sauce was very good with great aromatics, the pippa duck was probably sitting on the pass too long as the skin wasn't that crispy and the cod with champagne and honey sauce was awful.  The cod dish smacked of something to put on the menu to try and elevate the place, why ruin the delicate flavour of fish with such a sickly sauce?  In true Chinese cooking sugar and sweeteners are used as seasoning to bring out natural sweetness not make the dish sweet.  The cod aside it was a pleasant meal (though I wonder why we were offered garlic chilli paste as a chilli dipping sauce) and good value.  The ambience of the place suits a venue to impress because of the all round adequacies but there are better tasting Chinese plates around London.",-1
5,"Fine food, excellent service!   Everything we ordered was tasty.  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu!",1
4,"Hello London, good to see you it's been awhile.  Slip into Hakkasan for my first meal of the visit...HELLLLO London, I like your style.
There are two ways to look at Hakkasan.  The first could be your cynical side, observing Hakkasan is basic dim sum and chinese fare prepared exquisitely well.  Could I reconstruct the tastes at 1/5 of the price in LA via an afternoon crawl across the San Gabriel Valley?  Of course.
But, much like people, there is something to be said about a restaurant that knows what it wants to be, and has a personality to back it up.  Huge diversity, perfect drinks, and good service make it an easy recommend.
I have learned very few lessons in life other than the most essential (Always bet on black, never fight a land war in Asia) but a 3rd Hakkasan has confirmed is 'When confronted by Ostrich on a menu...order every damn time"".  It never fails, their version is an amazing balance of heat, sweet, and saltiness over rice.",1
1,Don't even bother going here if you are allergic to anything. They do not make any effort to accommodate any allergies.  Extremely disappointing experience. Terrible service. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.,-1
5,"Expensive but it is worth it!
Not your Restaurant for a casual dinner in the evening.
But if you have planned something special, this is the place to be. Beautiful interior design. Great Atmosphere. And the food is excellent.
The Dumplings as a stater are a must have!
Cocktails are awesome and dont let me start on the dessert. Exceptional!
The Service is very .. lets say frequent. It gets a bit annoying over time. But they are very friendly
Of course its very expensive but its well worth thw money. We paid 120 pounds for 2 people with shared starter and shared dessert. Plus 2 cocktails and Water.
But if you want to have a special dinnrr with somebody. Hakkasan is a good spot.",1
5,"There is a reason this place is always packed and that is great food and equally great ambiance.  Try one of the fresh juices with a shot of vodka if you drink.  The vegetable dumplings are divine and, lastly, the service is wonderful and elegant even under pressure.",1
4,"I was taken here recently, specifically to be ""impressed,"" and Hakkasan is very much a place to see and be seen. It's tucked away in a subterranean space on a small side street, but once you get inside, it's overwhelming for the senses, with ultramodern décor and a loud, lively lounge atmosphere. 
I tried a number of plates, including the dim sum platter, the stir-fry black pepper beef, and the sweet and sour pork. All were of reasonably high quality and presented gorgeously, if a bit small in size. The drinks were exceptionally strong. Even though I spread out 2 cocktails over 6 shared plates, I still stumbled dizzily up the steps and onto the street as we left later that evening. 
I hate being a party pooper, but it wasn't necessarily the best Chinese I've had - and I'm of Chinese descent to begin with. It was simply very good. I guess stylish décor, attention to detail, and reasonable food quality is all it takes to dress up otherwise conventional Chinese food into a Michelin star and command a truly spectacular price premium.
In the end, I enjoyed the overall experience, although I must stress that I'm by no means a high-maintenance person when it comes to being ""impressed."" ;) All in all, if you're ready to pay a pretty penny, then it's not a bad choice for a special night out or to celebrate with friends.",1
4,"We went to Hakkasan for a birthday brunch. The restaurant has lauched Dim Sum Sundays where you get to choose between two different menus. One with and one without champagne. Six courses, couple of drinks, champagne and dessert. For a very good price. 
The first course, a crispy duck salad was simply amazing. I still dream about it! It was followed by dumplings, dim sum, rolls, a main course, a small snack, and it was all very very good.
The staff was very attentive, the food was excellent, we had some amazing drinks and a lot of champage. All included in the menu we went for. 
There was a DJ playing, and the restaurant was packed, but even though it was packed, you got all the attention you could expect from the staff. We had a very good time, and I will defiitly go back!",1
4,"A meal I truly enjoyed but it could of gotten anywhere from three to five stars.  First, the issue some other Yelpers complained about, ""bouncers"" outside has been resolved.  Rather than anyone intimidating, a very nice women met us outside and checked our reservation, as well as making sure the staff downstairs was prepared for us.
In terms of the meal itself, again I can see how it could anything from three to five stars.  The menu is fantastic.  Probably twenty, twenty-five dishes I wish I could of ordered.  The problem was there definitely was inconsistency.  Some food was wow, this is what I expect from a top London restaurants.  Others were weaker than what you would get at a local Chinese restaurant.  Started with the Dim Sum platter, which was interesting, but flavor and complexity did not stand up to the top Dim Sum around Leicester Square.  The appetizers that jumped out were duck rolls (spring rolls filled with duck) and the ribs, which had a great caramelized exterior.  Both of those clearly five stars.
I was with four other people so we were able to sample multiple entrees.  I had Pipa Duck, effectively peking duck without the pancakes.  It was perfectly prepared and everyone who tried it loved it.  Also stand out was a black beef dish.  On the other hand sweet and sour berkshire pork had no more flavor or complexity than I would expect in an airport and was left half eaten).  Dessert was also good but not memorable.
Service was definitely five stars, friendly, attentive, but not overpowering.  Atmosphere is fantastic either for a business dinner or date.
Overall a great experience but the food should have been more consistent.",1
4,"So the whole entrance experience is pretty amazing - I felt like I was entering a James Bond villian's lair. Scary looking bouncer at the front checked the reservations list before letting us go down to the mysterious, dark-stoned lobby, where we were greeted by a clique of model-esque hostesses in hot pink dresses.
The restaurant is huge by London standards, very spacious with beautiful, modern Oriental style carved wood panels.
We had the Taste of Hakkasan set menu deal which was fantastic value. The miso cod was delicious as was the Rice Krispie dessert with pop rocks (!). The cocktails were also very tasty.
This place is just a shade away from being a bit too pretentious and overpriced - but I can thankfully report that the service, food and atmosphere were all great.",1
5,"I can't fault this place. 
Great Food - great service and a beautifully contradictory space. 
The only down side is most people need to take out a loan to eat here.  If you can - experience it!",1
4,"My birthday fell on the Chinese New Year this year (well, at least on London's celebration of the fact) and we decided to embrace the theme. Accordingly, we booked Hakkasan for lunch and its sibling, Yauatcha, for dinner.
I didn't know much about Hakkasan, but man, were we pleasantly surprised.
Ok, first things first, this is definitely toned-down Chinese. But it's classy toned-down Chinese, and if you just embrace the fact that you're eating upscale fusion food, you'll be fine.
The décor is really pleasant: it's sort of a cheeky take on a traditional tea house, with cut wood dividers and little dabs of tat. It's dimly lit and just modern enough, without being so chic that you feel alienated. There's a DJ spinning pleasant background mood music right in the centre of the central wing (there are three, and I believe a few private rooms), and a full bar.
Drinks: really good, balanced, and as described in the menu.
Food: solid, and set at an appropriate price point for quality/quantity. But don't get the pumpkin tofu; it was a massive disappointment.
Service: spotty, but not for wont of trying. The place was packed, there were lion dancers weaving in and out, and you got the distinct impression that it wasn't normally this chaotic. There were two slips in the service (the wrong drink, and the aforementioned tofu arrived around the time we were ordering dessert) but the staff were trained to the calibre you'd expect for this level of establishment, polite, unobtrusive, smiley. Great overall.
As a bonus, the dessert here wasn't an afterthought, and the tea menu was delightful. I have a soft spot for places which actually brew my tea well and yes, Hakkasan, you did just that.
I do wish that the flavour profiles stuck a bit closer to their roots, and that's the only reason Hakkasan misses out on its 5th star. Aside from one fried nibble with dried scallop inside, and some very very mild preserved duck egg in another, I found things just a bit lacking in the flavour department overall.",1
5,"Expensive but definitely the real deal with great portion sizes! 
The service is spot on, continually topped up and eager to keep our table tidy and presentable.
Definitely going back for the great atmosphere and selection of food.",1
5,"This is by far London's trendiest place for Chinese. Walk past the bouncers and down the stairs into a decadent dimly lit lounge. It's definitely a hot scene so be sure to dress the part!
Usually places like Hakkasan are more about the vibe and B-list celebrity spotting than the food, however, that is so not the case here. I went to Hakkasan last month for a friend's birthday. We had an elaborate tasting menu, which annoyingly had to be vegetarian, but was still quite the feast. 
One tip, if you do the vegetarian tasting menu---some fake meats are clearly better than others. The black pepper vegetarian chicken and surprisingly the fake pork (or what tasted like vegetarian pork) were divine. I never had such tasty vegetarian food, seriously and I've been to Saf! The fake shrimp on the other hand had a less desirable gelatin texture though the sauce was great for my rice.
For drinks, the cocktail and sake menu is extensive. There is a fantastic and slightly eclectic range of house martinis---get the cucumber saketini. 
This isn't a proper review unless I also describe the toilets, and specifically the tiny woman who guards the door to the facilities. She is as diminutive as the door is massive. I'm still not sure how she can sense when you have left the toilets and how she musters the strength to open the insanely heavy door. Bizarre comment, I know, but check it out yourself! Everyone who went to the toilets commented about the WC attendant.
In summary, if you are in the mood for some tasty and very very scene-y Chinese look no further than Hakkasan.",1
5,"Amazing dim sum and consistent quality between locations.
Cocktails are delicious -- recommend the mandarin mojito!",1
3,"Came here for over-priced dimsum and mainly to see what's the fuss is about. The restaurant is located in a sort-of alleyway hidden somewhere behind Tottenham Court Road which was a little difficult to find at first. 
When we got there, there was the scent of joss-sticks which is nostalgic of the wrong sort. It reminded me of Chinese temples or the altar room I had back in my home. Having this scent permeate a Michelin-starred restaurant was quite odd and the dark and dim lighting reminded me of the time when I visited Abercrombie and Fitch sans the loud music.
Good service was expected of a Michelin-starred restaurant, so at first impression they were doing OK, then I started finding flaws later on. Our coats were collected before we were seated but before we were even sat, my friend noted that one of the waiters gave her and us a once-over. How rude! I know we weren't dressed up posh but it's not like we came from the slums either. Nevertheless, his attitude was quite off-putting. 
Choices of dimsum were severely limited. Despite this, the food that we ordered were good and well made. We enjoyed the standard selection of har gau, siu mai, etc. but it was quite disappointing that we were made to share when the dishes came in either 3 or 4 pieces per dish. The waiter could've told us this when we ordered or made exceptions so all of us could happily have one each. Perhaps I am expecting too much but 13% for service (0.5% more than the standard 12.5%)??
Overall, the food was good but the service was meh. I expected more out of a posh restaurant because that's one of the key points (besides the food) that sets it apart from the normal non-starred ones. 
Honestly, for the service, I can get better elsewhere. (even normal-posh Chinese restaurants overseas have way better service... with better lighting as well).",-1
3,I always enjoy the food but it comes at a premium due to the name. It starts with white tea priced at £7.40 more than a cocktail in most places. The nice thing is that it's great for an extended lunch as you can order more dishes as you go and they are never in a hurry to get you out the door. The dim sum platter is great to share and leave room for the chocolate ganache desert.,-1
5,"I came here with my parents while living in London and have been to several other locations since.  This was one of my favorite dining experiences ever.  The decor is very trendy, all with dark wood but due to lights over each table, there are no problems reading the menu to experiencing the food.  The duck salad is one of the best things that I have ever eaten, and the dim sum was pretty fantastic as well.
Overall, this place blew my expectations away compared to what I thought an 'Asian Fusion' place would be like.  The food was amazing, drinks were good and strong, and desserts were unique and very good as well.  While a meal here does come with a hefty price tag, I felt like it was somewhat justified by the quality of our experience.",1
4,"It was difficult for me and my husband to justify paying as much as we did for Chinese food, when we are so used to getting the real deal in Chicago's Chinatown (and for free from our friends back in Detroit) for the past five or so years. However, the innovative cocktails menu, the high quality of the ingredients in the dishes and the posh vibe made up for some of this hesitation.
We were pleased to see not only the long list of options for drinks but also very unique combinations of flavors, so we ended up splurging by ordering two each and sipping on each other's.
My husband, fellow Yelper Eliter Michal, has an obsession for cocktails with egg white. The U.S. mostly shies away from using it except with the New Orleans Ramos Gin Fizz. However, at Hakkasan there were at least four or five options that had egg white. He got one with a ""jasmine egg white foam"" that had pomegranate. Afterward, he went with a whiskey drink for contrast - ""Smoky Negroni."" 
I got a not-too sweet but very zippy martini called the Thea and was happy to see it was mixed with one of our fav Polish vodkas (Michal grew up in Poland!) - a hard-to-get bison grass variety. With a blend of sharp ginger, slighty sweet yet tart apple and lime juices, this drink was smooth yet strong. My second was a very refreshing Kumquat Mojito, a fruit I rarely see and never with mint and rum. I'm grateful for our server's suggestions!
Now for a quick run-down on what we ate: We decided to forego the preset menu because all the dishes looked too familiar yet too expensive to us. Instead, we opted to do family-style sharing/tapas-style with all appetizers (in order of what we liked best to least).
*Crispy duck salad- Props to our server for suggesting this, as it was our fav dish of the night. Duck has always been my fav protein and Chinese preparation (usually Peking BBQ) is my jam. I enjoyed these tiny fried morsels mixed with bright microgreens, which was just the perfect fresh complement to this decadent meat.
*Soft shell crab - amazingly tasty with right amount of crispies and seasoning, devoured quickly with hit of spice from red chili flake and curry leaf
*Turbot soup with mushroom (AKA wild fungus and goji berry) - flavorful broth with wild mushrooms not used to seeing.
*Fried aubergine (eggplant) and mushroom - surprised at how crispy yet light these were! A bit larger of a portion than needed though.
*Dim Sum Platter of shumai and dumplings (one with lobster, another with caviar/scallop/shrimp, another with crab and chives) - seems overpriced until you consider the filling but this one was not worth it to me because I'd rather just eat the filling if I'm paying that much.
For dessert, I was excited to see calamansi as that lime-like fruit reminds me of Filipino food, so we got the calamansi and chocolate ganache. It wasn't too sweet with the perfect balance of tart and rich, but it also was not too heavy or big to end the night.
Ultimately, go for drinks and a few apps to share for a special night out that won't break the bank (too much).",1
5,"I was secretly hoping to go to Hakkasan for a meal, so I while we were shopping at MUJI nearby I dragged hubby in here for a light dinner.  This is one of my all time favorite restaurants in London and I recommend Hakkasan to anyone who asks.
Super classy sexy place.  I liked the idea of the ""list"" and bouncer upstairs at the entrance.  Gives a feeling of exclusivity.  Of course we didn't have reservations  :-(.  But they just called down and it was no problem.  And they didn't seem fazed by the fact that we weren't dressed up at all (jeans, boots) and were loaded down with shopping bags.  When we got down the stairs they were expecting us, and took our jackets and seated us right away.  I liked the service was snappy.  
Although Hakkasan can be expensive, it doesn't have to be.  I might have mentioned this in my initial review but the dishes range from under £20 to over £30.  And there's plenty of choice throughout the entire price range.  Since we weren't that hungry we ordered the shanghai dumplings, dimsum platter and mapo tofu.  They also have an extensive cocktail menu.  Though not cheap at £10 each, they are incredibly good.  Real cocktails, not just cosmopolitans.
The shanghai dumplings were good but not as good as I've had living in SF.  I remember the dimsum platter being amazing, and while still good I think I've had more experience with high end dimsum.  I still think it's the best I've ever had but the comparison gap wasn't as large.  The map tofu was made with beef and it was amazing.  We were already full after the 2 starters but just couldn't stop eating the the tofu!  
Total meal was less than £50 for 2 starters, main, cocktail and tip.
Funny story about their obsession (good) with appearances, when tipping for the coat check we noticed that the dish had 3 pound coins arranged in it.  We added one more and received our coats to put on.  When we turn around they've removed one of the coins so there are only 3 again.  Only someone obsessed with design and aesthetics would ask the staff to do it.",1
3,Love this place. Cool Asian fusion. Upscale ambience. Get the multi-course option. You won't be disappointed.,-1
5,"Really love this place! The food is so tasty, just great. Recently I went here 2 times in one week. Both time we had the menu taste of Hakassan with a perfect cocktail. Expansive but worth it.",1
2,"Just returned from this restaurant.  This is a fun upscale place with mostly quite good Chinese food.  Close to 200 pounds for a rather light meal for 3.  We ordered drinks and food.  Was slightly taken aback when soup and appetizers arrived before our cocktails--but didn't think much of till our mains arrived before the rest of the appetizers and grew cold before we got to them. The dim sum plate was above average and very pretty to look at. The taste was good, but no where near as good as you'd find at a place catering to a primarily Chinese clientele.  The reviewer who said the har gau were the best ever has probably not eaten many. The cocktails were quite sweet even tho the waitress had told us they weren't.  The duck salad was very good;  the sweet and sour Berkshire pork was so-so: the pork not crispy an the accompaniment heavy on the onions with a few bell peppers.
When we finished they offered us dessert.  We chose some tea and while we were drinking it, we were asked to vacate the table-another party was waiting for it and there was a 2 hour limit!  So that was the reason for the slapdash service--they wanted to turn our table.  When I complained to the manager he said this was a policy of the restaurant, that we had been informed of when making the reservation (I didn't make so perhaps) and that we'd been called to remind us of that (an absolute lie).  The crucial point is that at no point when in premises were we informed of this and we were offered tea and dessert when we didn't have time to drink it.  Also,  I couldn't help but notice that many of the people seated near us had been there when we arrived and didn't seem to be under a curfew.  The manager did English Officiousness very well; giving a sh-t, not well at all.  As much as I enjoyed the classy, fun atmosphere and some of the food,  I would never go back.  Food 3.5.  Atmosphere 5.  Management 0.",-1
5,Been several times over the last 10 years and the quality of food has not gone down despite the global expansion. It is a bit over - priced but with a good bar and innovative food great to impress a date or if someone else is paying.,1
5,"Excellent food. Excellent atmosphere. Excellent service.
The tasting menus are very good, with a great variety of foods all with high quality. The dim sum is great, the ribs and peppered steak is juicy and has great flavor, and the prawns are outstanding. The desserts are good, but not exceptional. The very cool atmosphere is the icing on the cake. Highly recommended.",1
5,"This place is beyond amazing. I've been many times over the last few years and still love it. Try the crispy duck salad. They have a dinner special now - 35 pounds for three courses, which is a good deal as it's quite a pricey restaurant.",1
5,"I'll be brief: The best customer service I've received in a long time, and probably in my top 5 dining experiences ever. I was never left wanting for anything, the staff was incredibly knowledgeable about every menu item, and plates were brought in and taken away in a completely unobtrusive manner. These people are professionals of the upmost degree, and hats off to them.
The food was excellent. We shared some 4 small plates and entrees, plus a noodle dish and some excellent vegetables. I'd say the highlights for me were the small plates, particularly the salt and pepper squid and the dim sum platter (i'm looking at you little scallop and prawn wrap of tastiness) Unfortunately, it was still Chinese, and despite spending some $400 American on a meal, we were still hungry a few hours later and ended up at a Burger King. 
I can't say i'd come back unless I was once again invited as a guest,  as this place is definitely WAY out of my price range. Still, I feel incredibly fortunate to have had a chance to experience this meal.",1
3,"In a word, awkward. There is no other way to describe it. Was it that I was checked in for a near empty restaurant in the alley entrance? Was it that someone's job was to just open the bathroom door? Or that people seemed to be lingering around you at all times, just odd. 
I had no idea what I was doing with this menu and the waitress was little help. If you offer your help with the menu, I'd expect that you, well help. We began with salt and pepper squid and the dim sum sampler. The dim sum was the better of the two. My wife had the sea bass for her main and I had the Mongolian stir fry venison. I liked the venison a lot, but wish it had more veggies. They also do not have brown rice and they don't even include rice with your mains, which seems really nickel and dime. Good thing the food was great. Call that a 4 and the service a 2. On the plus side there is an impressive bourbon selection that included options you can't find in the states, Maker's black label anyone?",-1
5,"Simply superb. Portions are not pretentious, food is exquisite and service is impeccable.",1
5,"This review is for the dim sum.
Best kept Dim Sum secret.  Cost?  Pretty much the same range as any other dim sum place in London...a small premium.  Quality?  10x better than any other dim sum place in London.  What's that you say?  You thought Hakkasan was for the filthy rich?  Not authentic enough?  Wrong 
I admit that I had my doubts.  A look at their dinner menu posted outside made me scream a little in my head.... tricked into another overpriced Chinese restaurant in London.  Puh.  Well, that may be the case for the dinner menu, but the dim sum menu is very reasonably priced.  For two people, the cost came out to be the same as Royal China except everything about the Hakkasan dim sum experience outshone any other dim sum place I've been to in London (and we were stuffed for the rest of the day).  So let's talk about the food.
The menu is a combination of traditional dim sum plates and a few plates with a unique spin.  We had a go with both types, and were pleasantly surprised with all.  Generally speaking, every dish was good and very well executed both in taste and texture.  However, four things really stood out to me:
1.  Chang Fen with Beef Flank - I can't recommend this dish enough.  My boyfriend nearly devoured the whole thing, and I was trying to fight him for it.  Hakkasan have taken a little spin on the original Chang Fen idea, and topped off the Chang Fen with...well, basically a version of Cantonese Beef Stew.  Who would have thought to put the two together?  The Chang Fen itself is phenomenal.  PERFECT texture----slippery and soft, but firm enough to not break apart when you pick it up with chopsticks (No other dim sum place around London has seemed to master the texture of Chang Fen.... most of the time, it's overly soft).
2.  Shanghai dumplings - do not get this.  It is basically just pot stickers.  I thought it would be real Shanghai dumplings, which is one of my favourite dim sum plates.  Remember that Shanghai dumplings should always be steamed, filled only with meat (NO VEGGIES), and so juicy that when you first bite into it, you get burnt by the hot juice splattering across your chin.  If a Shanghai dumpling does meet these requirements, then it is not a true Shanghai dumpling.
3.  The dessert menu had White fungus & pear soup.  Surprise!!  Don't be put off by the white fungus description!  This soup brings back home for me as my mother used to make it in the summer time.  You can drink it cold (the way I like it) or hot, and it's just a really smooth, not overly sweet, dessert to have at the end of a meal.
4.  Tea.  I probably drink more than a litre of tea a day if I'm at home.  And all Chinese teas I stock up on from trips to China.  Hakkasan actually have a fairly good tea menu with some pretty traditional teas that you don't normally find in other Chinese restaurants.  Pu-er cha for instance and Tie Guan Yin (which we had, and was very good!!!).  
I am definitely coming back here.  I am not even sure I would give any other dim sum place in London a chance again.  It's worth the tiny 5 pound premium.  The quality of the food is just amazing, and really under-priced in London terms.",1
5,Dim Sum Sampler was amazing and so was the sea bass.  I will definitely be going to one of their other locations once I return to the US.  The desserts were especially amazing.  Food is like art here.,1
4,"Great service. Order the lamb salad. Truly memorable, although I'm not sure why they call it a salad. The Pipa Duck is also marvelous.",1
5,"Dim sum is one thing that can be done very well for reasonably cheap, so I entered Hakkasan's luxurious space afraid we would be shelling out for the chic flower arrangements, the lush seating, and the seductive ambience.  My fears found themselves unfounded - yes, Hakkasan presented its food with impressive, elegant trappings, but these were just a gorgeous frame worthy of presenting the attractive and phenomenally delicious dim sum.
I'm going to get two brief complaints out of the way first.  1.  No pictures allowed, and that's company policy.  2.  Our waitress seemed a bit impatient at first, as we were first-timers who didn't necessarily know how much to order or how this new-fangled cartless dim sum worked.  She answered our questions, but seemed a little surly about it.  She did warm up to us quickly, though, and service was generally unproblematic and even friendly at times.
Now, the food.  We were presented with a la carte and dim sum menus, and went all dim sum, with one order of vegetarian dim sum from the a la carte menu.  We started with this vegetarian dim sum platter, which came with two pieces each of crystal dumpling, vegetable shumai, yam bean and shiitake dumpling, and vegetable beancurd roll.  We proceeded with the steamed king crab noodle wrap, the chinese chive dumpling with prawn and crabmeat, the seafood dumpling consomme, the scallop shumai with tobiko caviar, the char sui bun, and an order of the Singapore vermicelli with prawn and squid.
Each dim sum order came in its own little bamboo container or ceramic bowl, and everything looked beautiful - dumpling skins in deep honeydew green, glistening scallop topped with jewel-like tobiko, burgundy pork peeking out of white clouds bursting quietly at the seams...the presentation was a cut above any dim sum I'd ever seen before.
Incredibly, it tasted even better.  Every last bit of dim sum was cooked gently to unveil bold flavors and toothsome textures.  The dumpling skins were impossibly good, the consomme soothing and deeply aromatic, the Singapore noodles fluffy and wonderful laced with firm bits of seafood.  Not one bite fell short of eye-opening, and Hakkasan unlocked a new level of dim sum in my culinary universe.
 
We should have stopped there, but curiosity got the better of us and we tried the tapioca pearl pudding, which came with little snatches of vanilla panna cotta, poached banana, passion fruit sorbet, and caramel popcorn.  I prefer the humbler version of this dessert offered at lower-end dim sum places.  This one tried too hard and the result was a messy hodge-podge of clashing and cluttering flavors.  The rest of the meal was so delightful that I'm going to forget this final bit ever happened.
Hakkasan was a revelation.  In one meal - and a lunch, at that - I obtained a new lens by which to judge dim sum.  My experience wasn't perfect, but the core of it was, and it is upsetting that I can't go back and repeat it any time soon.
Also, the bathrooms are REALLY COOL.",1
5,The food is awesome and it has a great ambiance. The drink menu works as well with the food as vine. No matter which way you go you need to try the Hakkan. Best drink I had all year!,1
5,"Tried dim sum for forst time in my life here. I am not much of a person who likes to experiment, but was dragged in here by a group of friends.
Liked the place very much, liked the dim sum very much also.",1
3,"Hakkasan has an atmosphere and decor that any celebrity would love to be caught in. I thought I may have accidentally wondered into Buddakhan. The woodwork in the dining room is unbelievable. If you have read any of my other reviews you could guess that this is not my type of restaurant. 
Dim Sum starter was ok but took about five minutes to cool down enough to put in my mouth. Crispy duck rolls somehow managed to not be greasy without being dry. However they were bland and needed the sauce served with them. Sha cha seafood toban was bit uninspired. 
I'd never come back here.",-1
4,"I was positively surprised to find the setting, the food quality and variety are better than what I expected.  Of course, there is a price tag for this.  Avg nearly $80 person after currency conversion, without any alcohol.  
Three downsides:
-no high chair for kid, so not suitable for toddlers
-no designated servant, it feels like everyone serves every table.  So some request may be lost 
-no leftover take-out: we first under ordered and then over-ordered.  At the time we get the check, we were told that there is no left-over takeout.  So be careful when you order",1
2,"We really didn't like Hakkasan.  It definitely has an interesting ambiance, but the food and cocktails weren't up to par. This is a see and be seen kind 
of place so don't expect great things from the food like we did based off all the glowing reviews.  We left after the starters.",-1
1,"What about this place? I have been at alot of fusion asian places espacially in N.Y like Buddhakan, Tao etc, i love asian fusion restaurants and food.
Strange bouncers at the entrance(more night club style)-not good feeling
Closet-very proffesionel
Toilet-boring, nothing special, why dont put some effort to decor?
Now i had looked forward to this place and food, heard alot of great reviws. The food was total out of flavour, it was so bad everything from starter to main courses, dessert was ok. 
Drinks was also bad.
Prices where ok, but comparing whit the bad food it was very high
Sorry to say but a big misstake go to Hakkasan",-1
4,"Last summer, I reviewed the Hakkasan restaurant located at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami. I absolutely loved their food so it only seemed logical during my recent my week-end in London to have dinner at one of their London locations which, in my case, happened to be the Hanway Place one.
Upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised with the fact that the restaurant was almost identical to its sister location in Miami for the setting there is absolutely stunning. I had their Dim-Sum platter which were tender and perfect.
The Dim-Sum platter tenderness was matched by their Wagyu beef which was a delicacy that I really enjoyed.
All in all, I had a very good dinner although I hated the fact that I felt we were being rushed out after the main course as our waiter told us that our table had to be cleared for their next customers and that since we had gotten there ten minutes late, they could not allow us to have dessert. I, then, argued that hadn't they had directed us to the bar and left us there for a good 25 minutes after our arrival, we wouldn't have had to order dessert so late. Finally, the restaurant manager ""agreed"" to let us order dessert which we did.
All in all, I had a great experience food wise but the aforementioned ""dessert incident"" is the kind of things that can absolutely spoil an otherwise perfect dinner. I understand that this restaurant seems to be always full but how can anyone in their right mind tell their customers they can't order dessert?
One last detail: as this restaurant is located beneath ground level, there is no cellular signal whatsoever anywhere inside.

3,"I was there several times with friends of mine.We enjoy our meals every time.They are very good at cooking one of the tastiest dishes ever.You should try the duck meat,for sure:)
If you are going there for the first time-be prepared that the atmosphere is kind of unusual.For me,personally,the atmosphere when I step inside was like I am entering a night club.May be this was an effect of the dramatic dark wooden decor. But when you get used to it..you will enjoy it :)",-1
5,"Delicious food, great atmosphere and very professional staff.  The dim sum is ridiculously good...  Highly recommended.",1
5,I went there for New Year's Eve with 5 other friends. Everyone was truly satisfied with the food. I had the Pipa duck... Brilliant. The service and the atmosphere are also two things that bring this restaurant close to perfection.,1
4,"This was my first time at this restaurant. Overall, the decor was fabulous - one of the coolest spaces I've seen in a long town. 
I don't live in London - I live in San Francisco. But overall, I thought the food was very good. I had the corn and crab soup and the roasted chicken satay. Overall, I thought all of the other dishes we had (lamb salad, tofu, double cooked pork) were all very strong as well.
This place is fairly pricey, so I'd give it a 4 out of 5 stars. Great ambiance, very good (but not outstanding) food. Great for out-of-towners like me.",1
4,"A special dinner place - the food is upscale Chinese, and very tasty. I tried the salt and pepper squid, Fresh Water prawns (spicy and great) as well as some pork and chicken dishes. The real star here is the bar. I have never seen so much elaborate care taken to make a martini - careful attention to ingredients - misting the vermouth, entertaining just to watch. Good whisky selection as well.
Very hard to find without a cab driver's knowledge!",1
4,"I was on a business trip to London in late March/early April that coincided with my 30th birthday.  My ex-pat cousins invited a couple friends and fashioned a nice, little, away from home, celebratory gathering for me at Hakkasan.
I'm not quite sure how my cousin found Hakkasan (She'd been once before, I think).  It's nestled in a corner down a handful of streets to tiny that in NYC (where I'm from), we'd call them alleys.  From the outside, you can tell it's perilously hip.  The clues are the lighting (yes, even from outside) and the bouncer-type folks at the door.
We were greeted once inside and invited to the bar for a drink while waiting for our reservation/table that was almost ready.  There's a coat check right there (always appreciated in the London weather).  The interior is darkly lit (but menus and such are still clearly visible), larger than one would ever expect (and very well populated), and still quite hip.
The bar service was quick and efficient and my prosecco was quite tasty.  Only a few minutes later, our table was ready and we moved with our drinks to sit.
The menu is quite extensive.  And with our party of six, we used it as an excuse to try a LOT.  We had 5-6 appetizers, 5-6 entrees, a couple of bottles of sake, and 6 desserts shared around the table (OK, the desserts were a little less shared because certain people had become territorial over their sugar by that point).  It's now July so I won't attempt adequate descriptions on so many dishes months later.  However, I remember some truly succulent duck (I LOVE properly cooked duck) as well as a host of other dishes that were creative and all nicely balanced-spice-wise.
Our waiter was attentive and had plenty of answers and suggestions when we asked for his thoughts on the menu (always a good thing).  He was present without being overbearing and a delight.  And one of our party members accidentally dropped a glass, breaking it.  The staff acted as if it was no trouble at all and it was cleaned up and replaced faster than one could blink.
My dessert was presented with a ""Happy Birthday"" beautifully written in cursive in chocolate on my place.
My only real qualm with Hakkasan is that they asked us to put our camera away.  I hadn't planned on snapping over and over throughout the meal (Those people annoy me too), but I did want a few shots since it was such a monumental birthday.  I guess that would disturb the hip vibe.
Hakkasan seems expensive, but I am American and everything in London does.  Was the price of the same number in USD as opposed to GBP, I wouldn't bat an eye.  However, I was treated...and even if I wasn't, I am happy to pay for good food on nice occasions.  Perhaps I will have another on a future London trip.",1
4,"Chinese cuisine at its best, amazing decor, quite unique! contributes to the special feeling , the anticipation that this restaurant creates.
The tastes, the smells, all wonderful and lingering long after you leave.
Fantastic and delicious!",1
4,"Taking a sophisticated Chinese friend from Hong Kong for lunch in London is always tricky as the standard of the home city is so unbelievably high, and so it proved on this occasion when she expressed herself impressed with the decor, but found the food not as good as in Hong Hong and the whole place a bit pretentious. In truth, it's not a place for lunch, though they do a pretty good dim sum, as it's decorated and lit like a nightclub and the menu prices make no concession to the time of day, unlike other Michelin-starred restaurants such as L'Atelier Joel Robuchon where you can have a prix fixe at lunchtime for £19.
 The staff too are somewhat snooty - as has been noted elsewhere, and our waiter was both a touch surly and distinctly unhelpful when we wanted to make more room on the rather too small (for a Chinese meal) table for two. The pretentiousness came out again when he saw me taking a photo of the dim sum and was positively 'British Airways steward' in trying to suggest that I was in the wrong. I quite understand restaurants don't want people flashing their cameras at other diners, but discreet no-flash photos of your own food is fine and I refuse to be brow-beaten. As a consequence, I took more than usual of the decor.(also apparently banned).
 The crispy squid was good and well seasoned and the seafood soup delicious - it tasted almost as good as the fabled sharks-fin rice that one is sometimes given in private company restaurants in Beijing and which costs an Emperor's ransom, and the roast chicken and stir-fried lotus root was excellent too. Though not quite good enough for seasoned Hong Kong tastebuds.
 We only drank tea (of which there was a fine selection) so we avoided the mark-ups on the wines which have made others wince, but we emerged in to the light with a pretty big hole in our wallet for a lunchtime meal and some tiresome service
 A final point; I am now unimpressed with restaurants and pubs which don't provide free wi-fi - and extremely unimpressed it's not available in a basement like Hakkasan, as one can't pick up 3G either.",1
5,"Hakkasan still has not been ousted as my top restaurant in London. I recently went to its sister restaurant in Miami (yes very random) and it wasn't quite as delectable as the London version.
 I'll admit to being ridiculously biased but I still have not found anything that quite compares to their peppery veggie chicken, morning glory, medley of exotic cocktails and did I mention hot (male) bartenders? Obviously that doesn't impact the taste of the cocktails..
 It better be on your list for top London restaurants to visit. Avid movie goers will remember that Hugh Grant took his 'crush' there on a first date in 'About a Boy'. So if its good enough for Hugh...",1
4,"Very impressive-first time I had visited a Michelin Star  restaurant and did so with work in a big group of about 30 of us. They deal very well with us and the service is always spot on. Amazing fragrances in the lobby, dark atmosphere and exciting place",1
4,"The atmosphere was a bit pretentious, and I was not a fan of the whole ""designer-y"" look. The drinks and food were delicious though, and the seafood clay pot is one of the best dishes I have ever had.",1
4,"Had lunch here on Friday. Overall really good, had dim sum to start which was pretty standard. As for mains, spicy beef was great, the prawns were really good, lobster with black beans was excellent and the pork dish also good.
 We also had the crab, which looked good as it came in the shell with all the claws, but it was actually annoying and time consuming to get the crab out of the shell, and not really worth the effort, particularly as we were with clients so had to try to not make too much of a mess (although the sauce ended up all over my shirt anyway).
 Dessert was good, its nice to be able to have something other than lychees or banana fritters in a Chinese restaurant",1
4,"Big, loud, gorgeous, delicious. A bit pricey, but I wasn't paying.  And they let us stay late.",1
2,"Went here on the last night of my trip in Europe because my dad (who lives in London) said its his favorite restaurant. Now.. obviously I'm from California, so going to a high end ""asian"" restaurant in England made me skeptical from the get-go.
The first thing that ticked me off about this place is the fact that we had to have our reservation checked not only once but TWICE by the stuck up snobs that worked there (once at the door and once again when we got inside). Yeah, I know a family does not fit the profile of young and wannabe rich, but that shouldn't warrant attitude from restaurant staff of what's supposedly high end (this is not a damn club). We're going here for the supposed good food, not to act like douches and stare at everyone else in the restaurant. This ain't Hollywood.. so the B.S. shouldn't even be a factor here.
Secondly, they sat us all the way in furthest corner of the restaurant in the furthest place from other guests as humanly possible. I thought I had escaped the L.A. pretentiousness by going across the pond but I guess its even worse here even when they don't have any celebrities to cater to. 
Lastly, nothing we ordered was bad.. but NOTHING was what I would consider good - AT ALL. All the deserts were mediocre too. The only thing that lived up to my expectations was the service; but it should be a given in a place like this. 
The only points I'm giving are for the service and for the decor/ambiance because both were very nice. Looks wise this restaurant does rival nice spots in Los Angeles so its a good place to 'impress' someone I guess. 
Given the ridiculously bad attitude from the staff and the fact that the food did not impress me at all, I would definitely have to say there's no way I would ever go back. But I can see the appeal for most people.",-1
4,We came to this place on a friends recommendation. We did not have a reservation but were seated immediately. They brought us menus and then disappeared. Finally i waved a guy down who admitted to being our waiter. He didn't say much just nodded a lot.  We ordered a £150 bottle of sake. That and the appetizers were wonderful. The entrees arrived and they were delicious. I gave four stars only because i felt the staff was stuffy and stand offish. The waiter broke a glass on our table and never said a word. To his credit he shook my hand when we left but i am sure that was for the 13% service charge he tacked on.,1
4,"Needless to say, there's a lot of ""fuss"" going around about Hakkasan, mostly being all positive. I think it's really important to undertsand that this is not your regular Michelin star restaurant. No silver service, pretentious service....far from it. You're even seated on time limit which for me personally means no Michelin star but I don't make the rules. The decor and interior is fantastic, nice traditional asian touch with modern brasserie style buzz. However, the food is a slight let-down. Let's remind ourselves again that this is supposed to be Michelin star class. Salt and pepper squid was the highlight but the rest was above average, but ceratinly below what you would expect at such an establishment. Hakkasan is absolutely an overall good experience for all the senses but the tastebuds are left the least entertained.",1
5,"Excellent...Extraordinary food, great service..They also make great Manhattans.",1
4,"I was not entirely blown away, and it was not the best chinese food I have EVER had... But it was pretty good and I still do recommend it. Maybe I was expecting too much. It is also not as pricey as you may expect. With cocktails, appetizers and main dish each, it was about 50 pounds.",1
4,"Think sexiness, think pleasure, think a dining experience that makes you ooooooooooze sex ... think Hakkasan! 
I have wanted to go here to eat for a long time .. only ever managed to make it for cocktails before. 
Last we went for some food to celebrate life. It was delicious. The ambiance and attnetion to detail of this place is wonderful. 
I had Duck rolls for starters and Roast Duck for main ... just devine. The side veggies were cooked to perfection. 
We had a beautiful seasoned Rjoca to top it off ..perfect.
It is pricey but I think totally worth it! 
Would recomend for romance , would recommend for cheering up, would recommend for drinks ! 
Loved it !",1
2,"Beautiful ambience, but i've had a better meal for £5 in Chinatown. We tried a dozen different dishes, and not a single one was memorable.
The pricey cocktails were also a disappointment - for £10 and 10 ingredients, you'd think you'd get something other than a gin and juice.
Shame all this sexy atmosphere is wasted, but silly me, this is clearly a feast for the eyes, and not the tongue.",-1
3,"I was recommended Hakkasan by around a billion people (which is coincidentally about the population of China), but it was my old flatmate's words that got me here in the end.
""Just came back from Hakkasan... guess who we saw there? Jordan. And The King of Jordan""
Haha, what a perfect double-celebrity sighting! I had to go.
But sadly for me there was no celebrity sighting just boring nobodies around me, I wonder if the people sitting on the tables near me thought the same of me. Pah. Of course not... they'd be honoured to be sitting near Tom E off of Yelp.
So with no celeb sightings what else would Hakkasan offer? Well, the dark chocolate feel of the comfortable deep tones and wood made it certainly feel chic, modern but also perfectly functional inside. Kudos to Alan Yau once more for his skill in design. The service was impeccable as expected and the salt and pepper fried squid was beyond superb. I can still taste it in my dreams.
But for the price (high as a Hong Kong block of flats), other dishes were just not on par. Specifically I'm thinking of...
1. The dumplings... good but not orgasmic, and
2. Mapo Tofu - a limp excuse for 4 times the normal price of my all-time fave chinese dish.
[sad face with tear coming out of one eye]
Still, it was a great experience I'd love to try again but not until I've been to little sister Yauatcha about a million more times. That's where my loyalty lies.",-1
4,"This is a very trendy restaurant to go and be seen. I didn't see any celebrities (though my British celebrity knowledge isn't that great) but this is definitely somewhere you can expect to see a sighting. A guest list lady is at the door, don't even think of walking up without a reservation (unless by chance you are a celebrity reading this awesome Yelp review) and I hear that tables often need to be booked quite well in advance. The ambiance and decor is trendy and reminds me of the upmarket restaurants that are adjoined to Las Vegas nightclubs. The food was good but tbh not as spectacular as you'd think given the high price - I think you are very much paying for the wealthy and fashionable vibe rather than the quality of the food. If you want to impress your significant other with a trendy night on the town this is a good place to start or if you're a tourist consider this as a good example of a fashionable London restaurant.",1
4,"I went here with a (former) boyfriend and his co-workers for Chinese New Year celebration.  It was delicious!  It is a bit difficult to find as it is hidden in what you might think is just a back alleyway, but the interior is beautiful and sleek.
The service was great.  We kept ordering more and more to share and our waitress was patient with us but prompt with bringing our food to the table and also offered her suggestions on what we should have.
One warning.  The toilets are a bit tricky.  I wasn't able to tell which one was the ladies' and which one the mens' because of how they are marked!  Once I figured it out though, it was fine!",1
5,"Update: We enjoyed our meal on our second visit, but this time at their Mayfair, Berkeley Square location. Much nicer people, and good service and not rude door bouncers. Perhaps the Hanway Place staff should take note.",1

(

 )
 I have a love-hate relationship with Hakkasan  there are so many things to admire about this place but also so much I dislike. Over the years, I have returned many times to Hakkasan, and on every visit I found that what I loved most about this place - the food - had been consistently good. My last visit was no exception.
 Much has been said about French designer Christian Liaigre's multi million pound interior, Hakkasan's Michelin Star rating in 2003, and its listing in S. Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2008, so I will not go over old ground.
 Despite the occasional snooty service, and the extortionate prices for their teas I keep going back. I love the décor, and unlike many, I do not feel that the restaurant lighting is excessively dark - I find it soothing and feel that it adds to the overall experience at Hakkasan.
 I was pleasantly surprised to find I was able to book a table at 12:30pm for dim sum when I called on that same Saturday morning. Dr G and I headed to the familiar spot on Hanway Place, and were soon seated. We ordered a pot of Orchid Pao Chung tea @ £4.30 and a selection of eight dim sum dishes. These were:
 Scallop shumai with tobiko caviar @ £5.20  the scallops tasted fresh, and were within the finest skin I have encountered. The tobiko caviar added a sophisticated look and a pleasant saltiness/crunchiness to the delicate scallops.
 Braised beef brisket with cheung fun @ £4.80  this was also delicious although I was expecting to have beef brisket cheung fun not with cheung fun (my mistake!). The meat was braised to perfection in a deliciously sweet broth with hints of cinnamon and star anise. It was lovely to be able to finish off this delicious sauce with the added cheung fun.
 Crispy smoked duck and pumpkin puff @ £4.80  I loved both the presentation and flavours of this dish. The combination of pumpkin and duck was perfect and made for a good alternative to the more usual prawn & pork combo.
 Sticky rice in lotus leaf with wind dried pork and salted duck egg yolk @ £4.50 this was also a delicious dish with plenty of salted duck egg and pork filling in a thin case of sticky rice.
 Pan fried turnip cake with garlic and Chinese chive @ 5.50  the cake had a lovely texture, was crispy on the outside with a delicious flavor of fried chives and garlic. This was one of the highlights.
 Steamed corn-fed chicken bun with abalone and crabmeat @ £4.50  the combination of the different meats was surprisingly good within a light and delicious pastry.
 Steamed crabmeat siew long bun @ £6.00  Hakkasan's take on xiao long bao or Shanghai dumplings was as expected excellent, with plenty of soup and a thin, delicate skin.
 Sweet black sesame ball @ £3.30  stunning presentation and a light, fragile outer casing containing a generous amount of rich, sweet and nutty black sesame paste. This was a fantastic dessert and one I will make sure to order on my next visit.
 I apologize for the poor quality of the pictures. Hakkasan is renowned for not allowing any photography, and I was politely asked by management to stop taking pictures.
 Cost: £52 for two, or £26 per person including 13% (!) service charge. This is nearly twice as much as I would normally pay in most dim sum eateries in London.
 Likes: Excellent quality dishes beautifully presented, ultra fresh ingredients, stunningly designed restaurant.
 Dislikes: Efficient but impersonal service, no refilling of tea pot, and no photography allowed.
 Verdict: Hakkasan is one of those restaurants many would love to hate. I love it. I am still surprised by the amount of hostility this place attracts but in my opinion, despite the ridiculously high prices and the impersonal service, the food is fantastic and I will certainly be going back for more.",1
3,"The food is good, if perhaps a little over-priced. But this is all about the scene. The guys in black suits on the door, the squadrons of pretty waitresses, the ambience inside, and the people-watching. Get a seat facing the room or you're missing the point. 
For really authentic dim sum, go to Royal China or Top of the Town. But those won't be full of media bunnies in tight suits and short dresses, and you'll go home alone...
If you can't get a table, try Yauatcha, which is equally sceney and has arguably better food.",-1
4,"This place is amazing and you pay for every bit of it. If you feel like splurging on a stylish night out, then this is a great choice. 
You have someone greeting you at the door of this sleek hideaway. You have someone take your coat and yet another person check your reservation and guide you in. I'm surprised they didn't have someone forking the food into your mouth. 
I've found it tough to find a quality, creative cocktail in London - Hakkasan is clearly trying to make up for this and they do a good job. They also have a stellar wine list. 
The menu can be overwhelming. It's also shocking to see main entrees for £150 or more. I'm not kidding. It's nuts. 
My friend and I decided to split a bunch of starters including the dim sum platter (yummy), ribs (amazing), lamb salad (meat was too dry, I wouldn't pick this again), mushroom and water chesnut with lettuce (mediocre), soft shell crab (big yum). 
The waiter was average and didn't do a good job of advising us on how much to order and what makes a good combo, nor did she have any wine suggestions. For a place of this calibre, you'd expect the waiters to be pros. 
But in the end, it was all about the experience. It felt like being in a sleek spa, with scrumptious cocktails, original and memorable food and  WAY too expensive. I guess you're paying for them to have fifty people waiting around to show you to the bathroom and to keep up the gorgeous space...",1
5,Best dim sum in London hands down. Everything is good and it has a great bar with lots of cocktail options. Trendy vibe for sure as well. A must.,1
5,"Amazing food and gorgeous champagne. Definitely too many people serving you but they're all incredibly polite and helpful. Decor perhaps a bit too dark... 
Genrally a fantastic experience but way too expensive!",1
4,"The food is not bad, but their focus is more ambiance and atmosphere which is nothing wrong.  :)
If I want to get good/authentic dim sum/yum cha, then I would rather go to Royal China.  But if I want to enjoy some cocktails with friends and maybe some dim sum munches, then I would come here.",1
1,"It took me a long old time to get around to visiting Hakkasan and frankly had heard nothing but great things about it so was all set to enjoy a leisurely 'Thank God it's Friday' lunch with my oldest and thank goodness richest friend....the idea was to eat, drink and make very very merry indeed whilst catching up and generally having a rip roaring old time.
 Oh Dear! Despite many many glowing reports about firstly the amazing ambience, secondly the amazing cocktails and thirdly the amazing food, it was a disaster....the cocktails were really average, the food was so ludicrously overpriced for tiny portions that it was laughable and we were one of only 4 tables occupied in the whole restaurant, given the above I'm really not surprised...maybe it's passed it's sell by date...maybe we were just unlucky....but it was really disappointing and so stupidly expensive that even 'The Millionaire' baulked at the bill....this from a man who thinks nothing of paying £500 lunch for two....if he enjoys it. My advice? Go to China Tang instead.",-1
3,"Very Sexy place! I would go for a special occasion.
Enjoyable dinning experience. Fun drinks to enjoy at the bar with friends or a date.
Food is great, but kinda pricy. If you just want to enjoy some delicious, quality Chinese/Taiwanese food, go to Taiwan Village!!!",-1
4,"This place has been very good for years.  Not cheap, but fun and young, stylish atmosphere.",1
3,"Amazing space - very nice withour being too pretentious. I really just loved looking around. (Be prepared for the camouflaged toilets though!)
 The food was good, but my verdict at the end of the night was 'Michelin star Chinese food is still just Chinese food'
 We had a couple starters, calamari and duck with mango, which were both lovely.
 For mains we had pork belly and some sort of chicken. Both were just ok. Definitely not worth the price, but better than your average takeaway place.
 (But for as much as you pay here, it better be a hell of a lot better than just your average takeaway place!)",-1
5,"I always make a reservation at Hakkasan when in London. The food is excellent, the wine list is phenomenal, and the crowd is sexy. It's a Michelin-star winner and deserves all the hype it gets.  My favorites include the sesame prawn toast, salt and pepper squid, and stir-fry black pepper rib-eye. Remember your veggies! You won't go wrong with the pak choi and gai lan.",1
4,"Very sexy restaurant. Service was great - told the server to pick about 6 dishes on the menu for me and my date to share. His choices were great: crispy duck salad was my favorite, along with a spicy prawn dish. The lychee martinis were fantastic so I had a bunch of those.  Main downfall for me was our seat. We had to both sit on the same side of the table and there was a couple right next to us doing the same thing. It was a little close for comfort.
A lot of business dinners but also a lot of dates and party groups. Versatile restaurant with good food and service.",1
4,"This is my type of restaurant, if i don't go to eat great food. It is so forgettable, but the place is a masterpiece visually. The Dim Sum starter was extremely hot and the Ginger Rice was a disaster. This is one of my favorite restaurants in London. Cosmopolitan, chic, cool,sophisticated,  a hot spot. The music is loud , something i like in this kind of places. It was jazz and house, nothing out of this world, but good.   A memorable experience",1
5,"Outstanding! drinks are awesome, try the black forest martini or the white buffalo for something sweet like dessert. for vegetarians, this place rocks! bok choi with garlic, vegetarian dim sum, veggie lettuce wraps are to die for, veggie black pepper chicken will scare you it looks so real. chilean sea bass was yumalicious as were the red pepper chili prawns. music via live DJ and ambience was awesome, dress nice for fun, don't expect much of a convo, quite loud. great service....reservations a must way ahead of time, hot spot. don't go late for dinner (10 or later) if you need to cab or subway back, you will get stranded.",1
5,I really loved this upscale Chinese joint. Posh and classy deep underground near Tottenham Court Road. Lovely food and drinks. I had a lovely cocktail peppered around the rim and all the dishes we ordered were flavourful and spiced carefully. Ambiance is perfect and overall a very nice expreience! Must go to if you're in need of a posh fun place with good food and booze!,1
5,"Hakkasan is the parent of Yauatcha, another favourite restaurant of mine.
This is an exclusive and tranquil restaurant, which means eating here can be expensive and that also means I dine here only on the occasion.
It has a trendy ambience to it. It is located on a quiet road, and on entering you walk down some stairs into a basement, its dark and romantic, with the decor mixed with modern and oriental influence.
 
Menu is Chinese cuisine but more gourmets with some interesting flavours fused together which comes up with interesting tastes. 
I love my deserts, but dont tend to go for them in the Oriental restaurants, but on my recent trip here, I had a a pineapple cannelloni, which I never heard of, it was brilliant, but on the small side, I just wish there was more of it.
This is somewhere I would recommend you take your partner for a romantic meal, it's got a lovely, romantic setting and it's a great way if you want to impress somebody. However it comes with a price tag, drinks are relatively highly priced, and so is the food, expect to spend roughly £150 for starters mains and drinks for two, i have never spent less than that in here!! 
However, its definitely worth it for a nice treat. The whole experience is tops!
The service is of high quality as expected and the music is really funky, lounge with latest DJ's mixing their music. There is a small bar where you can have a few drinks before you dine, they have thought of everything at Hakkasan. I love it, and wish it was a little cheaper!",1
4,"If I wasn't such a style slut I wouldn't rate Hakkasan as highly as I do. The interior is dark and decadent. It's been rated no. 19 by the San Pellegrino top 50 restaurants in the world. Amidst the almost black browns and dim lighting, snooty staff glide through the restaurant. 
It's not a place you can linger in as you have set times to eat and get out. Yes I am rather cynical about it all. 
The vegetarian dim sum is delicious. One day I'd like to have the luxury of experiencing the menu with no concern for budget but for now I will stick to lunch time starter menu.",1
4,"Ling Ling @ Hakkasan is the bar of the famous Chinese restaurant Hakkasan. The bar is really good with a mix drinks including cocktails and special chinese drinks, they are prepared in front of you which is cool and the atmosphere is great in there. This place is perfect to have a drink before the supper in the Hakkasan or just to have a chilling out session in.",1
4,"I used to come here a great deal a few years ago. I have eaten here a few times, but I much prefer the experiences I've had just propped at the bar enjoying their delectable cocktails. Yes, the cocktails. I only ever come here specially to drink them. The bartenders are very professional, where making the drinks is almost a form of art. And the ingredients used are only ever fresh ones. I also always order their prawn crackers, which are the proper sort, tinged in a dark orange colour, served generously in a large bowl.
However, the prices for the food are much too expensive, almost too much for Chinese food to be honest. But despite this, it is delicious. In all, it is worth a visit just to bask in its amazing interior and to gorge on as many cocktails as possible!",1
5,"Still the best restaurant in London, for my money. Yes, not just the best Chinese but the best restaurant of any cuisine. Truly stands up to the best in New York.
The team have really thought about every ingredient and they have created a nouvelle Chinoise cuisine that is not pretentious or the ramshackle fusion you find in some modern Chinese restaurants.
I would recommend all their duck dishes, the lobster in garlic and black bean and the surprising turnip cake which is a creamy maked purée topped with shredded bacon. Tremendous.",1
5,"I should get two points for this place, because i went to both locations on consecutive nights.  Yes it is that good.  Yes i am that addicted, committed to the dumpling.  This place is chic, modern and dark and swanky.  It is crowded at night on a weekend.  The cocktail menu is extensive and after having quite a few all were amazing.  I tried to compare the lichee martini to nobus and it may have won.  It is such a weird dichotomy...ancient london street, quintessentially narrow and cobble-stoned...then you walk into this modern chinese food mecca and are accosted, though pleasantly by the smell of incense.   The dumplings, short ribs and crispy duck rolls are all amazing.  The shrimp dumplings a favorite.  And at the end when you go to leave...there are three people holding an umbrella over your head while they hail you a cab...please...its midnight, my curls came out ages ago but I'm flattered...and i will be back...",1
4,"Fantastic interior, food very good to fantastic, wine list very good. The bar and selection of spirits and cocktails is particularly fine. Good number of front-of-house staff, so service is superior too. Can I say the exotic fruit platter dessert is worth the trip all by itself.",1
5,"The entrance of the restaurant (in a basement) said it all and much about what you are about to find. Down there, is like you are no longer in London, the waiters have a strong unknown funny accent, the food is not just pretty and no flavour but rather strangely mixed on the plate and scrumptiously flavoured. 
This restaurant is a lovely way of meeting with asian country, without wasting as much money on travel.......
The whole experience was lovely",1
4,"At the entrance of Hakkasan you are met with two bouncer-esque characters who check your name on the reservation list. I'm not sure what their purpose is because there is a bar down stairs where you can wait for a table to become free when you don't have a reservation and also, when you reach the bottom of the stairs, you are once again asked for your reservation details anyway.
 The impact of Hakkasan is immediate - it is dark, yet shiny, with spot lighting on each of the tables and otherwise night-club lighting. The otherwise cavernous room is split into more intimate areas by large wooden poles which may or may not have been bamboo poles painted black. Its supposed to be a very modern take on the Chinese motiff. Unfortunately no photos allowed!
 The Hakkasan drinks menu was very impressive and contained a good balance of non-alcoholic and alcoholic cocktails not to mention a staggering wine list. When you check out some of the offerings its no wonder that people can easily spend hundreds, or even thousands, on one dinner here!
 The food menu was also fairly impressive, with diverse and sometimes unique offerings, but surprisingly nothing shouted EAT ME which is terribly unusual for me not to mention the fact that the prices were outrageous if not unexpected.
 To my surprise there was nothing on the dessert menu that we were interested in, even if we could fit more food into our very full bellies. Instead we opted for a second round of non-alcholic cocktails - very yummy.
 Overall Hakkasan is definitely a place to be experienced at least once but my recommendation would be to save it for a special occasion though if you're minted, well, I guess you could make it an everyday experience!",1
4,"I respect the quality that Hakkasan consistently provides to all of its diners. The last time that I ate here, it was a bit of a random event with a friend, and they fortunately had enough tables to seat us although they did warn us they needed the table back after a couple of hours.
 My friend was also wearing trainers and although the bouncer had to check with the manager, he let us go through anyway though told us about their normal dress code.
 Even now that the ownership has been transferred away from Yau, the last experience was just as good as previous ones. Service was prompt without being too in your face. We ordered both a starter and main with some vegetables and all of it was totally delicious. I'd highly recommend the ribs where the meat had been cooked to a point where it literally fell off the bone.
 It's cool inside and a nice dining experience overall.",1
4,"This is a top place, at a price. The food is excellent and portions are bigger than you might expect, so order small and add if you need it.
Arguably a little dark and claustrophobic, but you could say that's the atmoshere. They like to serve you quickly, to keep the tables turning over.",1
4,"The poshest Chinese in London? I think sonot sure it does take away though, which is a shame as the food is really excellent.
 There is a great variety on the menu for both food and drink and both are really very good and its worth going along just to try out the cocktails. You certainly used to be able to go and just bar fly which was a (relatively) cheap way to check out the venue and have a very nice drink. Not sure if you still can as I haven't been in a few months.
 Great atmosphere in the darkened basement with some very subtle lighting and some great understated but cool decor, and although it's big the lighting and set up means it holds onto a feeling of intimacy for either a date or a business meeting where you don't want the information to be available to all and sundry. The low lighting gives it a bit of a feeling of a new york restaurant for me.
 Anyway it's well worth a visit and its open late as well for all those night owls amongst us. Be warned though - I've only been phoned about possibly fraudulent spending on my credit card twiceonce was in Tokyo after buying two things in 5 minutes in a shop.and the other was after going out for dinner here. Cheap it is not.",1
5,"Awesome. I hate the word but credit where credit is due. V Good food. V Good atmosphere.....and the cocktails....Take the Hakka cocktail - a fine  beverage- I dare you to drink 5 hakkas and make it out the door without wanting to be amorous with the bouncer on the door (mate in case you read this please note that I am straight), the door, the lamp-post outside. It's not an aphrodisiac but it sure puts you in a good state of being... all that without the Yoga exercises. The price for the dining experience.... mmmm...bite my head but I did nor find it that bad. Less classy joints have cost me more even with vast amounts of alcohol I ordered. This place is my current favourite in London.",1
3,"I went to Hakkasan once with my friend and her boss together with their clients. It is overall a great place with tasteful (but just a little too commercial for my liking) interior. Lighting was particularly bad on the table; we could not even read our menu properly.
 The food is great but not superb considering the amount that we paid. The roast duck with caviar was £150! The total bill came to about £1000 for eight of us. The service was fantastic but I can't help but wonder if it was because we were spending so much. I heard from friends that they were really stringent with the 2 hour slot that you get when you book the tables. However, we booked the table for 8.30pm and we stayed for the entire evening till about 12 midnight!
 On the whole, I would say that this is a restaurant with good food and designer interior. However, it is not a place that warrants all the talking and all the hype.",-1
5,"You're not going to find many Michelin starred Chinese food restaurant, and Hakkasan is one of them (in fact, I think Alan Yau's other creation, Yautcha is the only other Michelin starred Chinese restaurant). And it doesn't disappoint: A trendy, dark lit setting, with comfortable seating, plus good food and service.
 Starting off, we ordered dim sum (prawn har gau anyone?), which was good, but not spectacular. For mains, among the dishes we ordered included the roast chicken in satay sauce (which was good) and the sauteed roast duck (which was brilliant).
 The friends I took were non-alcoholic, so we abstained from the strong selection of wines and cocktails (though there were non-alcoholic cocktails). The only obvious downside is the price.",1
5,"I really like Hakkasan, but you have to take it with a pinch of salt. Ultra-trendy, its the place to be seen enjoying contemporary Asian food. So don't get hung up on the posers, cos you're going to miss enjoying some of the best asian food in london.
 I love the setting - a subterranean dining space, accessed from a dingy alley off Tottenham Court Road. Hardly a salubrious neighbourhood, but it heightens the effect of entering such a trendy space. Dark, moodily lit, black ash furniture is all counterpointed with the occasional spot & neon blue lamp. The bar area boasts some comfortable sofas & an impressive drinks menu.
 Once you're seated service is attentive, especially as you start to realise that the restaurant holds a lot of covers. To be honest the food is well executed but there are no signature dishes. Unsurprisingly its expensive, but not overly so.",1
4,"Very cool setting & amazing interior - submerged lounge with dark woods and charcoal greys everywhere. The food is fantastic, and the cocktails are lovely (I recommend the bisongrass vodka with cucumber).
 The dim sum starter is amazing, as is the venison main meal, and any of the sea bass dishes.
 The menu has not changed in 5+ years, so it gets a bit tired if you have been many times, but still the vibe for dinner or even a drink is worth the price.",1
4,"When my boss heard that i had actually called up Hakkasan this morning and had got a reservation for tonight, he became all gloomy ... effect of the recession maybe, he says, gazing in the distance beyond me ... otherwise in the good old days you had to wait for days at least.
Reminder : Will tell him on monday not to worry too much. The place was packed with people. The fact that i was alone must have helped (why don't i have a friend in London who likes chinese food ? boo hoo).
I start with a crab meat starter. Tastes good ... a bit like calamari ... but nothing too special. But the main course was very good (i am proud of my choice). Mongolian venison ... soft, and very well cooked meat. It was lovely. Had it with the egg fried rice, which was rich and tasty. Is it my imagination, or was the light (rather, the lack of it) playing tricks on my eyes ? It seemed to me that they cook the fried rice only with egg yolks ... it was all yellow ... and did i mention that it was rich and tasty ?
The bowl contained a lot of rice, as the sweet lady serving me had warned. When she came to clear the table, she said ""wow !!! you ate all the rice !!!"". I spent exactly 6.2832 seconds trying to decide whether to feel proud or embarrassed. But i was too full to do much thinking.
I would have finished there and then. But those evil people going on around serving food and clearing the plates ... one of them sweet talked me into asking for the dessert menu. Can't give Hakkasan credit for the glorious sweet red sparkling wine that i ordered (didn't even know these things existed) ... but full credit to them for the sweet talk though :)
One star less because the place was too loud. I doubt if one can have a decent conversation here.
P.S: There were a group of arabs in a table nearby. Their glasses were being continuously refilled with wine without them even asking. If this can happen in a michelin starred restaurant, my boss has nothing to worry :)",1
4,"This isn't usually the kind of place I go to as it's waaay out of my price range, but I was fortunate enough to win a meal for two here. When I won the prize it said meal to the value of £200 so I thought I'd have trouble spending that amount, but the reality was that it was all too easy! A reasonable meal for two plus a bottle of wine took us over the £200 in the blink of an eye so this is somewhere to come if you have more money than you know what to do with, or if someone else is paying.
 Hakassan is in a maze of alleys behind Tottenham Court Road tube station and screams trendy from the Mitchell-brother-like bouncers on the door to the slate walls on the way down the stairs to the underground restaurant.
 The food was absolutely wonderful - the dish I enjoyed most was Mongolian stir-fried beef which was truly melt in the mouth. You also get the entertainment of watching the beautiful people - it's like a different world to the one I usually inhabit.
 Only downside was that the restaurant seems to limit diners to 2-hour sittings. The couple on the table next to me ordered more drinks after their meal and were cross-examined by the waitress about how long they were likely to take to drink them!
 Definitely worth a visit if you're feeling flush, but only if you can eat quickly!",1
1,"Hell's Kitchen or simply Hell?  Gordon Ramsay's head would have exploded. My friend and I decided to use our hotel $$ savings from the Hoxton's £1 Sale to splash out at London's first Michelin starred Chinese restaurant. Huge mistake and we knew it the minute we walked in to face a row of sullen Robert Palmer 'Addicted To Love' zomboids. 
The people of Hakkasan appear to be the most irritated species on the planet. Not only do they begrudgingly take coats and hold open loo doors, they also forcefully remind you (for the tenth time since making the reservation two months ago) that you absolutely must be finished with your table after 90 minutes, no exceptions. (And a hearty hello to you, too, oh irritated ones!) But it doesn't stop there. If you can open the menus without assaulting your closely situated neighbors, you are then tasked with divining the ingredients in the title sans descriptions dishes. We saw three duck dishes and made the mistake of asking our ill-humored waiter how each was prepared. Instead of waxing rhapsodic on the virtues of each, he snapped, ""They're all duck, that's all you need to know."" Hmmmph! It went further south from there, but at least it was consistent -- consistently awful to the point of hilarity. 
Spare yourself the scorn and scolding, unless of course, you're into that kind of thing.",-1
5,"I love this restaurant but it does warrant a special occasion - as other reviews has stated, you can easily get carried away (as the menu is so delicious) and will need to dig deep in your wallet to pay the bill.
 First off, it's difficult to find. Just off Tottenham Court Road, down a back alley, tucked away in the corner, set in an old underground carpark. Keep going towards the end of the street and you'll eventually find the exclusive entrance.
 Plunge into the bowels, down a set of sleek and very dark stairs and suddenly a wonderland will open up to you. This would be the perfect place to bring a first date you're keen to impress. The tables are discrete, the lighting moody and beautiful people waft around looking cool - although you will find the odd rowdy group of Chinese businessmen.
 Incense hangs in the air and you can just about take a sneaky peak into the buzzy kitchen.
 The menu is huge and pretty overwhelming. The tea-smoked ribs are a favourite, the jasmine rice served in a dainty bamboo basket. The pepper beef is also delicious.
 Service can be a little hit or miss for a restaurant of this caliber. But the food makes up for it.",1
5,Went to Hakkasan for my brother's birthday! The price for our meal was on the high side but it was well worth the money!,1
4,"Turn the lights down low enough and everyone in the restaurant looks beautiful and mysterious.  The lighting here is dark, but to be honest, the strategically-placed spotlights work well.  And it all adds to the atmosphere, which is most of what this cool restaurant is about.  The food was a bit pricey for what it was, but it was also unique and memorable, as well.",1
3,"Having been told that we were only allowed a 2 hour sitting my initial impression was not the great however after being ticked off the guest list by the bouncers at the door we entered the sleek bar/restaurant designed by Christian Liaigre. Trying the cocktails is a must while you wait for your table (particularly the lychee one!) and sitting at the bar in the buzzy yet chilled atmosphere is a great experience. Although the design of the restaurant is quite closely packed in the screens, darkness and low lights give the restaurant an intimate feel, perfect for any romantic dinner.
 Already knowing that the owner Alan Yau owns Wagamamas and another michelin star restaurant Yauatcha I was expecting the standard of food to be very high and I was not disappointed. The waitresses are constantly there for any need you might have but are not intrusive and at no point in the meal did we feel rushed.
 The menu contents is quite overwhelming and the dishes that have to be ordered 24 hours in advance (such as sharks fin and beluga caviar) make an interesting read. My starter and dessert (soft shell crab and chocolate and passionfruit ice-cream) was delicious, however my beef main unfortuantely tasted like standard chinese fare saying that though the rest of my party all had fantastic dishes.
 Hakkasans was a very enjoyable experience however it comes at a very steep price but it is to be recommended.",-1
3,"Best meal of my recent visit to London. Like some of the other yelpers , being from the west coast and living in NY, I was skeptical of an Asian fusion spot in London. I was pleasantly surprised from the moment we pulled up into the small back lane entrance and walked downstairs into a fabulous underground lair. The decor was beautiful asian-style and contemporary plus the place was packed with a great, upbeat ambiance. The food surpassed my expectations - it was adventurous chinese mixing a nice balance of authentic flavours with new flair. Served family style, it made for a great group meal and I kept eating long after I should have put the chopsticks down. Not to mention the delish lychee cocktails which were more creative than the usual lychee martinis you'll find at so many asian fusion spots. Only downshot, cocktails were a bit slow to be offered and then delivered to the table and after our allotted dining timeslot,  we were politely but firmly asked to leave rather than enjoy another drink. Understand this is a reality for hot tables in London, NY etc but I prefer a subtle request versus the pointed ushering towards the door. 
All said, I would absolutely return!",-1
4,One of the most intense dim sum experiences I have ever lived.  The setting here is truly amazing and a special place to eat a dim sum like you have never experienced.,1
3,"This is all about the scene. Can't remember a single thing about the food. Cocktails are good and wine is on the more expensive side. Dark, red interior, lots of glass, quite noisy, but great for people watching.",-1
5,"Went here a few years ago with family while we were in town.  Amazing food, and even made a dish without soy sauce for someone in our group who was allergic.  I think I had the mango duck and it was great.",1
3,"Well Maintained, has a very long bar... was the longest in london for a while... however for a chinese person there is f***g good food. highly recommended. :)",-1
3,"Possibly the darkest restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of eating in. The staff are intimidatingly polite, well dressed and numerous. No less than four members of staff showed us to our table in relay. A maze of passages guide you through corridors of latticework walls through which you can glimpse the faces of other diners and see the winking glint of spotlights and reflections as you walk along. Take a trip to the loo and you'll encounter a member of staff whose sole responsibility to guide gents into the mens ladies into the womens.
 At the table the service was efficient and the food arrived quickly. The starters are on the large side and more appropriate for sharing. I had the soft shell crab which was delicious. For the main I went the whole hog and ordered the grilled Wagyu beef. This was my first Wagyu experience; the meat was tender and succulent, easily the finest steak I've ever had. The steak was served sliced and arranged on two banana leaves that were formed into the shape of a boat. Bamboo shoots stood in as oars; the oar blades were slices of fresh chilli. My two friends ordered scallops and lobster and I sampled them both. Although the scallop and lobster meat itself was excellent, the sauces were a little bland which made the dishes seemed a little lackluster.
 It's a pity that the menu seems a little hit and miss as the surroundings are magical and the service was excellent. I'd come here again but would be careful about what I ordered.",-1
5,"In the centre of London the theory is: the better the quality of the food, the more recession occuring in your bank account. And Hakkasan most definitely keeps that theory alive!
The food is Incredible [kindly note the use of the capital 'I' for emphasis!] The restaurant itself is beautiful - with the lighting transforming the joint into an almost intimate, high-end night cub by the evening. 
Perfect for dinner with the person you wholeheartedly adore and would rightfully spend a fortune over. Though I suggest large group of friends or students go for the cheaper alternative and head down to Cape Town Fish Market - equally delicious but a little more affordable and a little less high-maintenance [I mean that in the best way possible....I do - hence the fifth star! hehe]",1
5,"Named one of the 50 best restaurants in the world by a respectable survey,  this place is another of Alan Yaus burgeoning and incredibly popular outposts of Asain gourmet cuisine, Hakkasan must rate as one of the best eating experiences in London. The style is opium-den decadent and the food, although expensive, is mouth-wateringly good and worth every penny. A fun extrovert crowd adds to the allure. The cocktails are out of this world, get any that has lychee, as are the extraordinary desserts. Hard to find, tucked away down a back alley, but once you're there you won't regret it.",1
5,"The restaurant is tucked away in an alley just off the Tottenham Court Road/Oxford Street junction. One's name is checked off on a list by a doorman; a back slate-lined stairway leads down to an incensed-perfumed reception hall and the restaurant. The decor is mostly black with backlit blue walls. Laser-beam spots punctuate the gloom, and geometric Chinese screens divide the tables. It manages to reference an art-deco Shanghai opium den while being very modern, luxurious and comfortable.
 Waiting for Liz at the bar, I had something called a Purple Emperor: a wonderfully smooth, but actually yellow mix (a base of rum and sake). The purple was supplied by a massive orchid the bartender popped on top for decoration
 My preconception was that a Michelin-starred trendy restaurant would offer small portions: however the opposite was very much the case, with every dish seemingly sized for two hungry eaters. A starter of Sechuan chili crab was enormous and completely fabulous; my dimsum selection was pretty good too and contained 8 large dimsum. My main of jasmine tea smoked chicken was amazing (but must have contained at least half a chicken). Liz had another massive pile  of ribs this time. Side orders were a very generous plate of pak choi and and a canister of steamed rice. Neither of us actually fancied the rice but our waiter insisted.
 He was a funny one  all the staff were charming and friendly except our waiter, who was quite aloof and dismissive and really couldn't be bothered to answer questions (all the staff are very beautiful  the restaurant could double as a modeling agency).
We got complete fireworks when we asked for a doggy bag for the large quantities of leftovers. We don't do takeaway! We don't do takeaway! our waiter insisted emotionally, as if the very suggestion was mortally insulting. OK, this is a very smart restaurant and obviously they want to distance themselves from fast-food joints: point taken (and obviously, Hakkasan is a world away from a takeaway). But there were HUGE amounts of leftovers of very delicious food I was loath to leave behind. However, I am completely averse to making a fuss in restaurants. Not so Liz, who made them very aware that on this occasion they would be doing a doggy bag! So, eventually, I climbed the stairs out clutching my precious hamper of leftovers (much admired by an American tourist). Even our waiter seemed to find the funny side at last.",1
4,"Great for groups. Modern, underground space. Long bar. Sexy feel with a very Asian sense. A bit like Spice Market in New York, but less kitsch. Food was tasty. Not the best / most authentic Chinese, but everything was full of flavor and nothing dissapointed. Will go back.",1
5,"When I called to make reservations, I was a bit baffled: the lady wasn't really that friendly and we could only have a table for 2 hours in total (in our case from 7 till 9 pm). What are they going to do? Tell us to spit out the last bit of food in our mouth and show us the bill? Made the reservations anyway, because one of my friends told me that the Hakkasan is a must. And he was right! To begin with the tight schedule: I don't know how, but we never had the feeling that we had to rush. It was very crowded, but we still enjoyed our privacy. The Asian food was very high-level. We were a party of 5 and the waiter recommended us to all choose something different for starters and main course and share. That worked out fine. It gives the whole evening (oh no, 2 hours) a very communicative and cosy touch. The service was very good anyway: very accurate, not at all obtrusive and very friendly. And somehow they really know how to get you out after 2 hours, without being pushed.
 Prices are fairly high, but for us tourists in London it was a one-time experience that I would not want to have missed out on. The combination of the perfect food, the one-time atmosphere with floral arrangements, without daylight (the restaurant is in a basement) and a very nice combination of hip and stylish elements without forgetting the need for cosiness, makes it to this one-time experience. Although, not that one-time I hope: I will definitely visit this restaurant again! And to be honest: you might want to leave after 2 hours anyway, because otherwise you might be broke by the end of the evening ;-).",1
5,"Hakkasan makes Chinese food fashionable. With its sexy black decor and amazing food and cocktails this is a place to take people to impress or be impressed. The food is genuinely very good, I would go so far to say the best Chinese in London. The atmosphere is buzzy and lots of fun as well for a group night out. It doesn't come cheaply, but hey you are in London",1
4,"It's a tricky one, upsides, the food was wonderful, the service good but for me, the downsides were : the bar was very busy and full of trendy media types who like the sound of their own voices, lots of beautiful people wanting to be seen and jostling their way past. Not really my kind of place but can't fault the food. Expensive (but I didn't pay)!",1
3,"This is a very fashon restaurant, is a meeting place for celebrities and it boasts of a superb design, inviting cocktails and a very sophisticated Chinese food. The dishes are well decorated and food is exquisited. The restaurant has soffused lights that create a night atmosphere, I find it very romantic! Maybe the atmosphere is too formal and staff are great! I go there once a month and always experiance a good service!",-1
4,"The food really is top quality - bursting with flavour and creativity. Service is really on the ball. I've been twice in 2009 and all dishes were good. There's a big 'but' unfortunately - the price. With the cheapest wine over £30 and a really nice Duck dish also more than £30, this place is really taking the p*. Fantastic food, ridiculous price - poor value.",1
5,"Modern Chinese restaurant (think Mr. Chow).
*not allowed to take pictures here* oops!
Directions:
You can't get dropped off right at the entrance of this restaurant because its a very skinny alleyway that leads to it. If you get dropped off of Oxford St., walk down Hanway Place and when it forks stay to the left. Go all the way down and the restaurant will be on the left at the end. Go down the flight of stairs and be greeted by a bouncer. 
The inside of the restaurant is all trendy asianed up. It is actually huge downstairs. I came here for dim sum.  All the items were a modern version of the traditional dim sum (no chicken feet here :( . The best dishes to order are xiao loan bao (I don't know the english name, but if the server doesn't understand you they are steamed pork dumplings that come with the ginger and vinegar sauce on the side). *Also when eating these dumplings, you need to let the soup inside drain out before you put it in your mouth or you will burn your tongue.* I'm not really sure what I ordered, I just asked the waiter for the most popular dishes. Here is what I didn't like: chicken soup and duck egg rolls. The pan fried chicken and shrimp dumplings were okay. I had this sea bass something dish that was interesting and would have been better if there was more sauce. If I go back I would probably skip the dim sum and go straight to their main dishes.
Okay, again with the desserts in London. Amazing! I don't know what my friends dessert was called, but it was soooo good. It was shapped like flan, but was more like ice cream and came with something similar to peanut brittle on the side. It seems like every place I try, the desserts get better and better. I decided to go the healthy route and ordered an exotic fruit platter (warning its huge!) If you come here, please save room for dessert, its the best part.

 For his birthday this year, The Peanut Gallery chose to be taken to Hakkasan. I can only guess it is no coincidence that the papers announced the next day that it is the most expensive restaurant, per minute of dining, in London. Uncanny. Hakkasan seems to be one of those places  you'll either love it or you'll hate it. I'm firmly in the love camp. Soaring ceIlings, dim lighting and dramatic, dark wooden decor reminded me of Buddakan in New York. Unlike in New York, where great grub and a spectacular setting often go hand in hand, it's so rare in London for such a fabulous fit out not to mean the food is complete rubbish. I have heard rumours of too cool for school service and door bouncers  there's NOTHING I hate more. Although they're glamorous with some gorgeous kit for uniforms (I'd wear those blue dresses on a night out) we found service at all times to be efficient, but quite friendly and helpful. I suppose the area when you first walk and face the line up in could be a tad intimidating. It feels like entering a night club and you have your name ticked off a list before you even step inside. But we quickly warmed up to it with a few martinis at the bar (lychee for me, classic for the birthday boy). It's fun place for some great cocktails, even if you don't stop for dinner. Once seated (for our strictly 2 hour time slot of feeding  we arrived early to linger at the bar for a while first), we started with prawn toast and a duck salad. The large, bulbous sesame prawn toasts are in a different league to anything I've had in a long while. They're fleshy and sweet, topped with sesame and served with a side of fried seaweed and enoki mushrooms. (£13.50) The crispy duck salad mixes moist strips of duck with crispy fresh greens, pomelo, pine nut and shallots. Very nice, if a tad forgettable. (£19.50) Our main serving of roast duck with Chinese herbs is soon pronounced by TPG, serious duck addict, to be the best he's ever eaten. It's full juicy, fatty flavour is spiced up by some generous seasoning, and the texture of crispy skin against moist juicy meat is spot on. (£21.00) Moist chunks of peppery, stir fried, rib-eye beef with merlot come spilling from a delicate, spindly nest. Again, big flavours and execution is just right. (£18.80)Desserts are artistic creations. Naturally, TPG has the warm coconut rice pudding with mango caviar and black sesame crunch. I have the gorgeous buttermilk bavarois with blood orange jelly and fresh blood orange. (£8.00 each). Both are stunning, with interesting, indulgent flavours  a party in your mouth. Hakkasan, under chef Tong Chee Hwee, has held a Michelin star since 2003. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is buzzing. Yes, Hakkasan is expensive  expect to upwards of £50 per head for food, and prices can of course soar if you get stuck into the cocktails or the wagyu (there's pair of £58 wagyu dishes). However, you can experience the glamour and some great Chinese food for a fraction of the price if you go for dim sum. It's fresh, interesting and the flavours pack some serious punch. I'll be back.",1
3,Expensive but food it great. However i like to see the food i buy as presentation is really important so gear up the lights a little or we could end up eating something not so pleasant.,-1
4,"I went here with some people for work, and was really looking forward to it because of all the hypeand it certainly lived up to it! The food is so delicious and there i such a varied choice on offer. The interior is a bit strange, and slightly claustrophic, but all in all it was a great experience.",1
5,Trendy Chinese restaurant. Situated in the basement-level but in a setting worthy of a Jet Li film. The food is great here despite the large size and number of tables in the venue. Especially after matches this is better than pasta!,1
5,"I love this place.  I hadn't been here in 3 years but it was just as enjoyable.  The design/atmosphere really can't be beat.  The cocktail list is exotic and everything I tried was good.  I loved the vegetarian dim sum platter, you get to try a little of everything.  I highly recommend the roasted silver cod with the champagne/honey sauce.  Yum!  Also got the tofu claypot which had a really good sauce.  Ok so things are overpriced but you're paying for the experience, which for me was worth it.",1
5,"Hakkasan, an Alan Yau's creation. I love it! I love it! I love it! Thats all I can say. The whole experience matches the food and drinks so well. Hoever, one down side is thta it is really expensives and the dishes are quite small portion. Try the duck with caviar and the stir fry venison. They are all great dishes, very tasty indeed. I will try to go more often if I can afford it. I recommend it to everyone. The interior is cool and designer like!",1
5,"This is a fabulous place to eat. Gorgeous and atmospheric interior and delicious food. There are definitely lots of people there who are there to be seen but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of food beautifully prepared. Only thing is that it can be a tad on the expensive side, so it's a great place to go as a treat/for something special.",1
4,Ignore Michelin - not cos they're wrong about this place but becasue Hakkasan isnt that type of place. It merits a Michelin star but that's not the thing you should focus on. It's actually fairly unpretentious and certainly not stuffy. the best thing to go for is the Dim Sum at lunch. There's a way to do it where you can only pay around £15 a head - just steer clear of the mineral water it's massively expensive. the best dishes to try are the Venison pork puff and all the cheung fun are pretty good. The service is always utterly charming without being OTT. I find the desserts a bit disappointing but overall I would say this is better than Hakkasan.,1
4,"This is apparently the only Chinese restaurant to be awarded with a michelin star. It is often rated as the best Chinese restaurant in London and maybe deservedly so. This is not your average Chinese eaterie. This is Chinese fine dining style. The food was good, though I can't really remember what we ate which is usually a sign that it wasn't that memorable. The decor is dark and fancy (apparently you can't take pictures here as the owner doesn't want unauthorised pictures of his restaurant circulating around - didn't test this rumour). Our party of four was sat on one of the tables around the sides. Apparently the main tables in the middle were fully booked, but actually it didn't look to me like it would be that nice sat at the tables in the middle. To sum up - good food, dark fancy decor, high prices. Would recommend it just for the experience.",1
4,"Been to Hakkasan only twice in my life. The first time (mid-2004) was shocking, mediocre food, poor servicereally did not intend to go back. Having revisited the restaurant during late August 2008, I'm in a totally different space. What a place! I've eaten in a host on Michelin* places in Europe and the USand this meal was excellent. Sesame prawn toasts, crispy duck salad, hot & sour soup, duck spring rolls, topped off with a couple of bottles of Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir. Excellent. We'll be back.",1
4,"Love this restaurant, one of my favourites, and not even for the food! The atmosphere grows as the night does so what starts out as lounge type music, builds the vibe as it gets later. It is expensive, but the place is classy and sophisticated. Its obscure entrance, makes it even more exclusive from a ladies point of view, the toilets are extremely grand Drinks selection goes on for days. Always had great service when we come here too.",1
5,"great drinks, great food, great service
with the onset of non-smoking rules, this place has no flaws from my point of view,  it is well worth the money
when it was a smoking ok place, it was pretty hard to tolerate, being underground with no air circulation",1
4,"This place is chic to be sure. But I had doubts about the food as we walked in. The dimly lit, sexy feel of the place echoed Mr. Chow's or some gimicky Chinese fusion place. And in a way, it IS gimicky, but it's still damn good. You won't come here just for the food - you'll come here for the ""scene"" as well. But we were surprised that this place had the authenticity and deliciousness to back up the scenester vibe. Every dish on the menu is almost as good as the real thing served in Chinatown or Paddington or Bayswater, or even Vancouver, NYC, or LA. The dishes are well presented and tasty, and they should be, because you're paying an arm and a leg for courses that should cost half the amount.  The steamed dim sum was pretty good, as was the stir fried morning glory vegetables, but our favorite was a dish of chicken braised in a clay pot with dark soy, ginger, and vegetables. The flavor of the dish was deep and hearty and very, very satisfying.",1
5,"I am a regular at this restaurant and I must say it is for a good reason. The food is absolutely delicious. Although, it can be a little pricey. The service is excellent and the interior decoration is very good. I simply love the setting.",1
5,"This is a very impressive restaurant. Begin your evening at the cocktail bar, which is an experience in itself, with a host of unusual martinis.
 The food I had was excellent, with probably the best cod I have ever eaten. However, do try to make sure that you don't get carried away with the ordering - which is very easy to do, as you will end up with too much food and a very hefy bill.
 We did have one problem with the wine - once opened and poured, the bottle was taken away from our table and placed in a bucket with several other bottles. Unfortunately, we did not get our bottle back and had to complain.
 Overall, this restaurant is a treat with great cocktails and fabulous food.",1
4,"Hakkasan remains one of my favourite venues. Yes it is expensive and yes you need to book but despite the location, the bar/restaurant is exquisite. Both the food and drinks are varied and delicious. I would however add that it is recently under new management and my last visit was disappointing on all fronts - but i am hoping that was a one off.",1
5,uber cool place very dark lighting which gives it its coolness great place to impress and just forget wat time it is.,1
5,"Great asian restaurant
 £36 - five persons, multiple dim sum dishes",1
5,"No hype this is the one. Consistant quality. Impecable staff and terrific Ambience. Some say it's too dark but my take is the dim light gives you more chance to savour the flavour of the cuisine. This is what I think they are trying to acheve and I believe they succced. Bar staff are terrific and seem to get it just right even when you take clients and try to impress ( I admit my Vodka knowledge is lacking..OK Jake its crap.) Top Dishes : Silver Cod, Vggie Chicken (love regular but this is terrific. No1 's Dish Tofu and Beef. Loved the Miami branch but it's just not London!",1
4,Hakkasan is a Michelin star rated Chinese fusion restaurant located down a back alley in Central London. You  would not know it was there unless you were specifically looking for it. Hakkasan is not reliant on pedestrian traffic and yet it can be difficult to get a reservation. There is actually a dress code and formal shoes are required. If you are going to spend this kind of money on a meal you should dress up and make an effort anyway. Do make sure to bring the credit card with you because this is an extremely ridiculously expensive restaurant. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is romantic. If you work it right you will be too drunk at the end of the meal to care about the price.  It is rated number 19 out of the 50 best restaurants in the WORLD not just London. I think going to restaurants you can't really afford makes for a memorable and more appreciated night reserved for birthdays and anniversaries. When was the last memorable meal you had at Nandos?,1
5,Please get the Duck Salad when if you get a chance to come here.  I still dream about it....,1
5,"trendy chinese restaurant, great food, great decor, great cocktails at the bar, quite pricey though, 200 pounds for dinner for tow must be the norm, the food is beautifully presented on the plate and melts into your mouth",1
5,"delectable dining, hidden away from the hustle and bustle of w1. dark, delicious interior with fantastic lighting, professional service, sleek design and, most importantly, divine dishes that will raise the bar when it comes to 21st century chinese cuisine.",1
4,"I tried this out on a Friday night. We had pre-booked a table but still had to wait 20mins at the bar until one was ready which was a bit annoying. The food (asian) is fantastic. The duck, which I am not normally a fan of generally, was really tender and tasty and I would definitely recommend it. Best to get dishes to share on the table with your friends so you get to try lots of things. Had heard previously it was riduculously expensive so was surprised when it came to about £40 a head (I thought it would be double). The items on the menu really vary in price - you have some mains for £15 and some for £60 so I guess it depends on what you order.",1
5,"Very nice Cantonese restaurant and actually pretty authentic - as a person raised in China. As other reviews already mentioned, prawn dishes generally are good, and all the cheung funs are fantastic",1
4,"I'm making my way through high-end Chinese restaurants in London. In general, I have a narrative in my mind that while some asian foods, like sushi, enjoy a high markup, Chinese food in the Western world is often seen as cheap takeaway. You expect to have your kung-pao chickens and beef and broccolis served up to you in a takeaway box for about £5 - leading to caricatures like Panda Express in the states and Wok to Walk in the UK. The problem with these too for actual Chinese establishments is that because of this unidimensional view and a universal expectation of cheapness - Chinese restaurants end up battling over operational efficiency - cutting costs, skimping on taxes, paying minimum wage. Re-imagined, upscale Chinese restaurants would bring the benefit of giving Chinese chefs in the western world more freedom to experiment and explore while raising the overall expectation of what a Chinese restaurant could be.
Yauatcha, I'm visiting right on the cusp of having Duck and Rice yesterday. But Yauatcha is in style more similar to Hakkasan than it is Duck and Rice. So after I've eaten all of these foods, imagine my surprise when I realized that all three of these restaurants were created by the SAME GUY - Alan Yau; Yautcha of course being his namesake, Hakkasan named after his ethnic minority background of being Hakka and Duck and Rice I can only imagine because the guy probably GORGES himself on that stuff. Good for him.I happened to come with my Asian American roommate from New York that also went to Harvard (many shared identities as you can see) and we both had the Tou Chan. You can find the menu online, but I'll run through some of my favorite of the dishes:
Chicken Gyoza
Wild Mushroom Dumpling  - I generally like anything named ""wild mushroom x"" and this was no exception
Beef in black-bean sauce - so good, it reminded me of my childhood favorite ""dou chi ling yu"" which is fish with black bean.
Ultimately a great meal, for a reasonable £35.
I also highly enjoyed the ""nan"" and the ""nu"" on the door and briefly wondered how a non-Chinese reader would be able to distinguish between the men and women's bathroom, until I looked more closely and saw the ""W"" and ""M"" etched into the doors.",1
4,"Great Asian restaurant in Soho!
Ambiance is gorgeous--a salt water aquarium, beautiful blue hued decor, very modern. The chairs and tables were lower to the ground than usual, which was interesting.
The service was top notch, very solicitous....until the last few minutes when we had to ask for our bill instead of it being brought to us, but that was minor.
The food was really delicious! The sweet and sour soup with mushroom was very flavorful and thick....and served piping hot in a bowl with a lid. The Thai chicken was crispy yet moist and tasty, not spicy.
The Kung pao chicken was quite good but had way too many peppers in it--they were a quarter of the dish! 
The vegetable fried rice was so good-- lots of flavor.
And we had one of their slices of mocha cake for dessert; so much flavor packed into a few delicious bites!
Pricey but worth it!",1
3,"For a true Asian - probably three star at its best, over priced dim sum with some fancy ingredient twist. 
Portions are small and the flavor is not particularly different even with the superior materials. The wagyu beef puff is the only thing i enjoyed of our ordering.",-1
4,"High end beautiful dim sum restaurant. Very fancy and pricy for dim sum in London but quite delicious and surprisingly the few dishes I had tasted authentic. I was expecting it to be westernized since it's not like your typical dim sum restaurant. 
I went solo so couldn't order too many things thus just got a few classics.
- steamed pork buns : pork was good mix of sweet and savory and the buns are nicely filled with the pork, they didn't skimp on the filling. It was slightly oversteamed but the taste was still really yummy.
- scallop and pork siu Mai : unlike traditional siu Mai, the scallop wasn't dried it was a fresh one! Probably why it was so expensive for just 3 pieces. I prefer the cheaper version with dried scallop but this was also quite tasty. 
- Xiao long bao(pork soup buns) : the wrapper is thicker than I usually prefer it but the taste of the soup and pork were on point! 
Overall really good experience, great service and ambiance. Heard their cocktails are worth trying as well. Will have to come back with a bunch of people to try more dishes!",1
3,"A Michelin Chinese restaurant in Soho London that specializes in Dim Sum. It opened in 2004 by Alan Yau who also created Wagamama and Hakkasan. Rated as one of the top restaurants in London plus multiple locations worldwide.....I was excited to try this place. But what a shocking disappointment in regards to the food. 
This place was highly recommended by some friends. They said this place offers some of the best Chinese food in London......I would 100% disagree. Maybe for non-Chinese people (which is all I saw in the restaurant).
The inside is a cool and sexy contemporary vibe. The ambiance with the bright floor, star-lit ceiling, neon lighting, and aquarium bar in the basement is a clever refreshing way to bring light to this otherwise dark and cave like space. 
When we arrived the hostess took our coats and bags and seated us at the bar downstairs for a few drink while our table was bring prepped. It was at that minute I noticed not one other Asians were eating here.....
At the bar downstairs the drinks were divine. My husband got cognac and me some tropical lychee non alcoholic drink. The bartender was excellent. Drinks were delicious. 
Dishes are colourful with strong flavours and texture contrasts according to the website with dim sum as the highlight. 
Once are table was ready they brought us to our table to start ordering. Here is what we ordered:
Scallop shui mai
Char siu bun
Crispy duck roll
Prawn cheung fun
Wagyu beef puff
Stir-fry rib eye beef in black bean sauce
Every tasted off. The stir fry rib eye and crispy duck roll was the closest to authentic...even that was a far stretch. I looked straight into the kitchen and saw only Chinese chefs......I should have asked to speak to a chef and asked him to cook me something off the menu. My husband ordered so much because he was simply hungry. But I asked him to stop ordering, grab the check, and let's head to Chinatown to eat after here. I was not about to waste precious macros on bad food. 
Service was pretty standard and could only get so good as it was super busy. The bartenders offered great service though. Definitely deserve a mention. 
I can see how this would get a Michelin Star for interior design, service, and playing/presentation. Food though no offense reminded me of PF Chang's in the states. I don't see how it get a Michelin Star. But that must be why not one Chinese person was seen here eating when I visited. 
Go if you want a sexy and fun dinner. But not if you want authentic dim sum.",-1
5,"This review is strictly for their gorgeous cakes! They cost 6 pounds each which is pretty decent compared to many of the other dessert shops here. 
FOOD:
Glancing at the case of cakes, I literally wanted to try everything! They all looked so beautiful. After much deliberation, I decided on the Honey Jasmine Milk Chocolate cake. I didn't try it that night, but the next day and it was soooo delicious! 
The decor is designed to perfect. There were 3 layer compacted into the tiny cake: milk chocolate ganche, jasmine buttercream and honey buttercream and chocolate pop rocks! 
SERVICE: 
If you want to come here just for the cakes, let the hostess know and they will call someone over to help you out at the cake station. The lady that helped us was really friendly! I asked if I could take a picture of the cake before she boxed it and she actually gave me the best looking one and asked if I wanted to take picture of any other cake. They box your cake in one of those boxes that you don't want to throw out.
If I'm ever back in London, I would come back just for the cakes!",1
4,"Dim Sum was on our must try list during our trip to London.  We had heard about Yauatcha and jumped at the chance to try,  We tried for reservations but there were none to be had.  They accommodated us quickly and got us a seat in the bar area that worked out great.  The food was REALLY good and had a lot of variety.  
Food - We tried a few different things as there were so many good options on the table.  Dim Sum, Duck and a Noodle Dish were the things that we tried:
Dim Sum - Char Sui Bun, Pork and Prawn Shu Mai and finally Chinese Chive and Prawn Dumplings.  All were very good.  Char Sui Buns are classic dim sum, great flavor.  The Pork and Prawn Shu Mai was good.  Finally the Chinese Chive and Prawn Dumpling were also done very well.  
Mains - We had the Crispy Aromatic Duck and the Singapore Stir fry vermicelli with prawns and squid.  The duck was incredible (first time trying it).  Not too oily and had great flavor.  I didn't have any of the noodles but wife really enjoyed it. 
Atmosphere - The restaurant is very modern looking and tastefully decorated.  We ended up sitting in the bar for dinner, but it didn't matter.  Many times I didnt feel that I was in a restaurant.  It felt like a cool place to hang out.  
Service - The service was top notch.  The servers were attentive, but not overbearing.  I never had to ask for a refill as they approached us at the right time.  The dishes (yes there were a lot) were brought out in stages as it didn't feel that we had things piling up.  We took our time and really enjoyed the experience.  
Great Job.  We really enjoyed our experience and told many of our friends.",1
5,"Loved the food. Great for lunch not recommended to dinner. Had two dishes that server suggested and both delicious. Next time, will try to seafood options. Not sure if this is something Robert would like.",1
3,"I was really excited to try a Michelin star restaurant. We came here to try their set menu ""Taste of Yauatcha"". The food was kind of a disappointment honestly, I expected better. It was nothing special at all. I've had better dimsum at other places. The service was good, our waiter was really nice and attentive. The atmosphere was different and cool.",-1
5,"Michelin star dim sum, that should be enough to get any dumpling lover in the door. They offer both entrees and dim sum style dumplings in a very chic modern style restaurant. Very fun atmosphere and they did become packed very fast upon our arrival.
They have very high quality dumplings served as you order them, no cart here. They come about 3 per order, more on some items. The selection is about as good as a dumpling house can get. Really fresh stuff and they stand out for a reason. I also tried their chicken soup which was excellent. They have awesome desserts, you can look as them on display. We tried the macaroons that were a lovely way to finish our meal.
The price was very fair for the location and accolades. I would definitely check them out.",1
5,"Had dinner there yesterday with my wife and friend. Perfect Chinese food and amazing deserts. Definitely my go to Chinese in London. Don't miss the Duck salad, and prawn pastry thing in sauce. Take a few macaroons home, especially the salted caramel one",1
5,"I first saw this restaurant on an article that stated that this was one of the cheaper options to try that has a Michelin star. As a result, when I went to London, I had to give this place a try. My family was seated right away when we went there. The environment was classy and it was very enjoyable looking at all of the desserts displayed on the side. Even though the dim sum is pricey compared to other Chinese restaurants, I think it's still worth the price since they use more expensive ingredients. My favorite was the scallop xiu mai. After eating here, I'd have to say this was the best dim sum restaurant I've ever had (and I've had a lot) but it's also by far the most expensive. If you have the cash, I highly recommend trying this place out. And don't forget to get the dessert too!",1
3,"Dimsum offers taste so great but are very expensive. Rating it 3star just because of the price but if you don't mind the money, i recommend this restaurant.",-1
4,"Having made our reservation weeks in advance and from thousands of miles away, I had no idea what we were in for. Yauatcha wasn't what I expected. 
There are no trolleys delivering steamed dishes. What you DO get is the option to choose a dim sum pre fixe that leaves your palette dazzled. 
If your thing is variety, service, chic ambiance and umami for days, this is the place. 
I've deleted one star because there is a no take out policy that kept us from taking the abundant left overs home or to the homeless.",1
5,"Best Chinese in a clean, forward , cool setting.  Chinese food does not need to be in a dingy, loud, elbow to elbow setting.  We came in after a day of going about town.  We had out two girls with us.  The waiter graciously offered to 'build' us a meal based on our 'hunger level'.  We had an assortment of dumpling appetizers, but I still think about that prawn cheung fun a month later.  These paired well with their refreshing drinks.  We also had the chili fried fish.  The finale was equally amazing, kids were so happy with the eye candy desserts that were just divine.  We hope to back when we are back in London.",1
5,"Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Cleanliness: 5/5
Decor & Style: 5/5
Ok yes, the food is amazing, but it is pretty expensive. It is not true authentic Dim Sum, however it is still very good. Michelin 1 star rated? Definitely. 
Shui Mai & Har gauwas great, however not true Chinese taste, had a modern flavor to it.
Char siu bun, Wagyu beef puff, Roasted duck pumpkin puff with pine nut, crispy duck roll all very, very good. 
Again, come here for the amazing food and nice modern environment but don't expect true Chinese dim sum flavors.",1
3,"Let me start by saying how excited I was to try my first Michelin Star restaurant. My overall experience was great but I just couldn't see how this is a Michelin Star Restaurant. I've traveled across the world for food, been to many upscale venues, and have had much better dim sum. I'm mind blown that this place received such a prestigious award over other establishments. The ambiance was elegant and modern. The service was standard for a high-end restaurant but the food was not that impressive. We ordered five a la carte dim sum dishes to share between the two of us for lunch. We got Har Gow, Wagyu Puff, Shrimp Cheung Fan, Crab and Pork Soup Dumplings, and Scallop Shumai. The food was subpar but the dessert was pretty good! We got the Chocolate Pebbles cake. Hmmm... maybe they got their Michelin Star for their desserts?",-1
3,"Highly overpriced.  If you're looking to get some great dim sum, I'd recommend walking over three blocks and hitting up Chinatown.  If you want a fusion experience with hit-or-miss dishes, you can give this place a try. 
You'll need a reservation, so be sure to make one online or by phone. 
Things worth ordering:
- Large Soup dumpling.  This is NOT the xiao long bao.  This is a small little pot lined with a dumpling wrap and stuffed with shrimp, scallop, and other delicious seafood bits.  The best part of this dish is the flavor of the soup that the dumpling is steamed in. 
- Shrimp cherng fun - The noodle wrap is very soft, yet not soggy.  The shrimp is also very fresh and crisp. 
- Turnip cake.  They prepare the dish a bit differently than the traditional style, pan frying the turnip cake with an egg.  
Things you can skip: 
- Shumai.  These are tiny and not very good. 
- Small Soup dumpling.  Xiao long bao.  The dumplings have a lot of soup.  One thing to note is that they stuff their dumplings with fish and pork, which is not common.",-1
4,"If nothing else, go here for the Wagyu Beef Puffs. They were unlike anything I have ever had and definitely worth the stop, I wanted to order about 3 more orders after finishing them.
Not to mention the drink menu is so unique in that they have a tea menu, and alcohol menu and one that encompasses the two. The ambiance also makes it a great spot for a date or even for a party of one. Enjoy!",1
5,"This is a must visit if you can, this is just an absolute experience that is hard to compare to anything i have ever tried, the quality of the food, the craftsmanship, the flavors so delicious and delicate is almost overwhelming!
And when it comes to service this is second to none, you feel just whiskered into another universe where attention to your meal and enjoyment is the sole purpose.
The only thing with this place that I regret is that i am not there right now.",1
5,"This is a contemporary Chinese restaurant nestled in the SOHO area of London just north Chinatown.  It is not your typical Chinese place. It is one of the few Michelin-starred Chinese restaurants. The ambiance is hip and has a night club feel to it. I'd compare Yauatcha to Hakkasan; I do prefer Yauatcha a little more.  
Except for the kitchen, I don't think there was a single Asian staff in the restaurant.  The wait staff is comprised of good looking young men and women that seemed like aspiring actors or models.  With that said, the service was professional and attentive. 
While the food (dim sum) is traditional the quality was steps beyond most dim sums I've had, even in L.A.  The non-Asian part of the restaurant is the large display of European desserts and hand-crafted gourmet chocolate.  There is also a 25-feet long macaron bar by the front window that makes every passerby stop and admire.  
The sweet and sour pork was delicious beyond my expectation. The batter was crispy, the pork seemed like lean pork tender loin and the sweetness and tartness of the sauce was perfectly balanced.  The softshell crab was served with garlic chips that looked like almond slices and, along the the Thai basil, added good body to the flavor of the lightly battered crab.  The various steamed dumplings were all delicately made and tasted great.  The biggest surprise of the meal was the baby bokchoy.  It looked quite simple without any garnish yet the flavor was quite complex.  I never thought that a plain vegetable like this can taste this good.  It tasted like it had been stir-fried with chicken stock and Shaoxing wine.
The desserts were all excellent and the presentation impressive. The tough part was to make the choice from so many options.
Expect to pay for the superb dining experience; but it is worth the money.",1
4,"I brought my parents to this place and maybe took them a bit out of their comfort zone but I didn't really care because I was excited to try everything! They offer so many different lovely exciting things. I had never heard of some of them. 
My dad got the Kung Pao Chicken dish because he's scared of trying new things, but he really loved it so that's good! 
My mom and I shared: 
prawn and bean curd cheung fun
scallop shui mai
steamed vegetable dumpling
mushroom spring roll with black truffle
king crab dumping
Everything we ate was very delicious. I had never tried cheung fun before but it was really interesting! It was a delicious prawn and bean curd filling in an incredibly crunchy layer with a pasta-like cover. Lots of textures and flavours. 
The spring roll was also a win because the truffle flavour was amaaaaazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the vegetable dumpling just because it was nothing special, but for the most part everything was very delicious and the service was great. 
I even got to see the lady at the table next to me dump all of her ribs on her lap, wrap them in her napkins and put them in her purse! I suppose she's got a dog at home? Also, by the way, they don't offer take-away containers, in case you couldn't figure that out.",1
5,"If their take out desserts are a part of the reason for their Michelin star, I can see why. Yauatcha was the last foodie stop I made during my trip in London as I was craving macarons. Unique Asian inspired macarons, yes please! Tip - this is a restaurant, so if you're just here for the desserts, inform the hostess and then make a sharp right to the display of desserts. You won't regret it!
I went with a bag of 6 for 9.80 pounds, which is pretty affordable given Yauatcha's status; they could have easily marked up their prices! The 6 flavors I chose were the coconut, matcha yuzu, apricot pistachio, strawberry, salted caramel, and the sesame. Extra star for the superb service - for my last macaron, I couldn't decide, so I asked for suggestions. The employee recommended the popcorn or the coconut, in which I went with the coconut. To my surprise, she then gave me a popcorn macaron just because! If a popcorn macaron sounds weird to you (it sounded strange to me at first), fear not because it was absolutely delicious! Definitely was one of my favorites! 
Although they were all really good, the other highlights were the matcha yuzu, the coconut, and the sesame. Basically just get the Asian inspired flavors! 
Also, these macarons come packaged in a cute little pink bow, making it a great gift :)",1
4,"Michelin stars aren't just handed out to those who ask for them, and while i only sampled a few dessert offerings at Yauatcha as opposed to their flagship Cantonese dishes, I certainly see why they get the attention that they do. 
Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?
From their super high end dessert bar to their very chic and contemporary formal dining area (with light that's oh so conducive to taking photos of your dishes), Yauatcha absolutely oozes class, and you can immediately spot the similarities to their mother ship Hakkasan (neon blue ring a bell?). Service is fast, friendly, and formal. Star Granted. 
Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?
Macarons are expensive these days, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my macarons at Yauatcha, where were notably large, only priced out to be $2.10 USD each once I did the conversion from pounds. That's notably cheaper than (smaller) macarons that I've had at Pierre Herme in Paris, which is certainly a win. I also ordered a signature 'Chocolate Pebble' that was a staggering six pounds, but I really can't fault the prices of flagship specialty desserts. Star Granted. 
Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?
One thing I'll point out is that the macaron flavors were just a tad bit limited at Yauatcha compared to some other shops that I've been to. Sure they had salted caramel and coconut and orange, but missing were classics like vanilla and rose or fun contemporary options like apple pie or banana. That's not really a fault (Pierre Herme has the same issue), but it was note worthy. 
The macarons themselves were excellent. Outside of the coconut all six of my macarons had excellent and more importantly consistent contrasting textures with powerful flavors on the back end, and the salted caramel in particular was divine. 
Arguably most surprising was the Chocolate Pebble, which was a symphony of truffle and liquid chocolate that had me appreciating chocolate like I'm not sure I ever have done. Dual Stars Granted. 
Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?
Yauatcha has earned all of the acclaim they've received, but their macarons fall ever so short compared to my all-time global favorites at Miann (Auckland) and Pierre Herme (Paris). I will certainly be back for the food though to give Yauatcha a proper and more thorough look. No Star Granted.",1
4,"We went for a dim sum lunch, and I generally enjoyed it. 
Dim sums were good, ranging the shu mai, har gow, wild mushrooms dim sum and prawn cheng fun. We also had the beef hor fun noodles, which went nicely with the dim sums. Lastly, they had a rather modern and western desserts menu, which we enjoyed to top off the meal.
Having said all that, I wasn't so sure if it lived up to all the fame and hype. Everything was good, but I felt lacked a differentiating personality. 
Service was overall good, though our waiter was quite curt. He seemed to be in a bad mood, and our interactions were not very pleasant. 
Ambience was posh -- possibly the most modern and western dim sum place I've been to. A good choice if you're looking to impress whilst also enjoying down to earth dim sums. 
Overall, would recommend it, but don't keep your expectations up too high.",1
2,"I really, really wanted to like this place, as the food style and restaurant concept is truly right up my alley. However, abysmal service soured my whole experience, and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it. 
Right from the start, my server gave no greeting, did not ask if I had any questions, did not explain the menu (and it's quite a huge menu to navigate), just said ""You ready?"" and waited with his notepad. He was entirely unhelpful when I asked him to describe certain dishes, giving shrugs or an apathetic ""Yeah, it's good."" 
When I asked for recommendations, he asked if I had dietary restrictions. I told him I did not eat cilantro, and the one item he recommended (wild mushroom dumplings) had cilantro. After taking a bite, I left the rest untouched - but I never saw the server again, and even when I mentioned to another server what had happened, there was no attempt to apologize, or ask if I'd like to order something else in its place.  
The other dumplings I got (poached chicken) were excellent. I also tried the crispy duck - and while I wanted to like it because it was a different take on Peking duck (I have no idea how it was prepared as that was - of course - not explained, but the duck was shredded in front of you instead of sliced), it was so dry that it was inedible without the sauce (which my server said would be ""oyster sauce"" - it was not - it was the classic Peking duck sauce). 
Too bad. Hope you have better luck than I did at this joint.",-1
4,"From the outside, you'd think it's a modern/contemporary restaurant, but it's actually a dim sum and dessert house.  The food is more authentic than not.  
I love baked goods and pastries, so I actually enjoyed that more than XLB and siu mai.  The green tea cake still is my favourite.",1
4,I came across Yauatcha soho on a walk throughout London. The first time I got a few macaron. They were excellent. The next day I came for dim sum brunch. The venison puff was amazing. The dim sum was good overall. But a bit pricey. Better to go with a group and try one of the tasting menus. Beautiful space. Good service.,1
3,"I am not sure how this establishment maintains its Michelin one star as it just fails miserably to meet the standards. The food is nothing more than any good Chinese restaurant in your local neighborhood. What really surprised me was the service. We had to request several times for our drinks. Water was not refilled and my utensils were not changed even though we asked for new plates. Our table was left uncleaned until we had to ask the manager to wipe it after 10 minutes or so. It seems they employ young untrained waiting staff. 
If you are looking for a good Chinese meal with very uncomfortable seating in a hip environment this is the place for you, however if you have visited other Michelin restaurants you will be deeply disappointed.",-1
2,My friend recommended this restaurant as a must eat. The ambience is super cute and modern. Food was ok. The service needs improvement (the lady refilled my husband's cup for water but completed neglected mine...how rude!) i want to like this place but I don't think I'll come back. I'd rather go to Chinatown for some dim sum.,-1
5,"just a fantastic experience!  For being michelin starred - it is very well priced.  Also the staff were excellent and service was quick.
We will definitely come back the next time we are in London!",1
4,"I went here cos I had heard they had some of the best scallops in London. Pre booked a table easily with a weeks notice. They phoned me up 2 days beforehand to check that I was still coming which was good. 
Arrived at the restaurant and the staff were really friendly. Sat down and was offered water and a Cucumber dish with 3 difference dips. One was really hot (chilli type dip) another more of a sweet and sour type and the last one I think was soy sauce. Ordered our drinks but had to wait 45mins for it to arrive which was the most annoying thing of the evening. First dish arrived which was the Venison puff, tasty bits of meat in a pastry with sesame seeds on top. Had to wait around another 15-20 mins or so for the next 3 dishes to arrive, scallop shui mai which was delicious, lobster dumpling which had a hint of ginger. Last one was Champagne scallops which was also nice. We then had to wait another 20 or so minutes for our beef in black bean sauce and rice and noodles dishes to arrive. When they came, only the rice and noodles arrived and we had to wait about 10 mins for the beef to turn up. By the time it came the noodles were cold. Shame, because the beef was really nice and soft!!! Didn't bother ordering desert because we couldn't be bothered to wait again and we had already been sitting on the table for nearly 2 hours. Asked for the bill (waited another 10 mins for it)
The food was top notch, staff really friendly. Only thing that stops it being 5 stars was all the waiting about. Would give the place another go just to see if the waiting about was just a one off!!!",1
4,"Nice setting in a prime central London location - lots of hustle and bustle outside yet they were able to capture a very serene and tranquil dining atmosphere inside on both levels (really enjoyed the lower level by the extra long aquarium). The dining is ideal of those of us who are vegetarians as suitable dishes are marked with an appropriate 'v' and servers are quite knowledgeable with all ingredients. Super nice to find in a London restaurant - progress!!! The food itself is high quality, absolutely fresh and delicious. We ordered a sampling of dim sum which were absolutely gorgeous and artwork in and of itself. The main course entrees were very tasty and enjoyable. Loved the experience and I'd return for lunch or dinner any day! Well done.",1
1,"Super overpriced for incredibly small portions. Some of the staff here are light weight on the rude side. Not too sure how this place got a Michelin star. Their noodles here are very delicious. Silky texture and flavorful but not greasy. Their lobster XLB is good but the skin broke way too easily. I'm pretty picky with my XLBs. Flavor was great, but not the best over ever had. Overall I definitely will not be coming back to this establishment.",-1
1,"The Ha Gau and Shui Mai is very good as well as the sticky rice in lotus leaf.
 But the lobster dumpling was below average 
The sweet and sour pork is not bad and it would be better paired with a steam rice but then I can't order and waste a full bowl of rice since the waitress informs me I can't take my left over food with me and I need to finished the food... 
Surprise how the management is able to put in the fine print re: disclaimer about food allergy, intolerance and any bespoke orders relate see can't be changed and even disclose about the VAT rate and  service charged of 13% but no where in the menu the management properly and appropriately inform or disclose no take out of left over... I failed to understand the policy and how the restaurant manage to operate without the consumer complaints",-1
3,"The dim sum is pretty good, but would not compare with the best you will find in Hong Kong, Singapore or Shanghai. The skin on the xiao long Bão is almost as thick as gyoza. Chichi décor, attracting lots of young Chinese princelings staying in London.",-1
3,"Alright. Arrived around 6:30pm and was seated immediately for two. Started with the chive and prawn steamed dumpling and another steamed dumpling with prawn. Three of each were served, and the presentation was unique and dainty. Also got the kung pao chicken and baby pak choi with garlic. It was a decent meal, but for the price, I thought it was unmemorable. Service was pretty slow: ended up having to ask three people for the check. Desserts looked amazing but opted for donuts down the road.",-1
3,"Not impressed. I rarely give a grim review... but when a table mate informed the server of her allergies... our waiters response was ""everything comes pre packaged or canned"" My thought was really?  
Surely they could have served steamed rice with fresh sushi... no soy. Instead they told her ""we have nothing we can serve you."" 
That was my first disappointment, but I don't think I need to explain any further. 
Michelin Star??? Not based on service or accommodations!",-1
5,"I was traveling in London with my mom and we desperately wanted dim sum. I looked on Infatuation London and this place sounded like exactly what we wanted. I only found out that it has one Michelin star after I had already made the reservation and I got 10 times more excited. Seriously, this was some of the best, most fancy dim sum I've ever had. The wagu beef puffs and the lobster dumplings were the stars of the show for sure. The drinks were also delicious and impressive. If you're ever in Soho going to see a show, go to Yauatcha first. But don't forget to make a reservation!!",1
1,"A complete waste of time. After a confirmation call from the restaurant the night before,asking our table preference, special occasion etc., the hostess managed to not only treat us with utter disrespect but would not seat us until we PROVED we had a reservation here. All this on my birthday! We did manage to find an email, but needless to say we were in no mood to eat here after all the unnecessary drama and went elsewhere. There are so many evening dim sum joints in Soho alone, so skip this pricy snooty place.",-1
4,Elevated take on Dim Sim in a trendy atmosphere. Opportunity to explore dishes you know done differently and many for the first time.,1
4,"Super modern setting, delicious food. The lychee martini while waiting for our table was a great start. We ordered a dozen small plates, including all three shu mai which were our favorite. Singapore noodles were very good as was the baby bok choy. Vegetable congee was a new taste for us. So glad we tried this Yelp hot spot.",1
5,We are Asian. We eat Asian food. We live in LA and NY the Mecca for Asian food of all kinds. In LA we live near Monterey Park which is known for its Chinese foods. This place albeit pricy is really good. Now you can find high quality like this in the US but in Soho with a great ambiance you are not going to be disappointed. Plus they have a macaroon bar!  We came in with no reservations however I would normally make one. We had a kid and they sat us at the bar. Any younger probably wouldn't work but for any kid 5 or older it works.,1
5,"Amazing restaurant!
The food was very special, a feast for the eyes.
Highly Recommend!",1
4,"Very hip and modern restaurant that featured pan Asian and dim sum food. The restaurant seemed like it was geared towards both drinks and food so it's a good place for either or. 
Dim sum dishes were roughly £4-7 and featured 3-4 shui Mai or dumplings depending on what you order. Noodle and meat dishes can range for £12-16 so the restaurant's food is a little on the pricey side.
Overall this is a good place to take your date, get together with some friends for a drink, or to get some dinner with friends. There's something for everyone.",1
5,"Michelin star? No. Service is average so don't expect a Michelin star restaurant. That said, the food is excellent, the menu is really for any taste and the desserts are just delicious.",1
5,"I think I love the interior design of the restaurant more than anything else haha. It's super modern and pretty but the Asian culture still remains. 
The dim sums are amazing!! I've been to Hong Kong and had delicious dim sum and this place is up there. Every item is small/delicate. At the same time, it is innovate and has lots of flavors. Honestly, everything I had was really good so just be open minded and order something you've never had before and surprise yourself :). 
Each person would need to order about 3 items. It's not the cheapest dim sum but it is well worth the money.",1
4,"The foods and ambience were very nice and modern and I did not feel like I am in the Chinese restaurant as I saw almost none of Asian waiters nor waitresses. 
Again, foods were delicious but portions were a bit small compared to its price so maybe everyone will feel a bit overpriced. However, that's worth it as I enjoyed the modern atmosphere there.",1
3,"Remembered fondly by a friend. Went last evening, great service, over ordered on anticipation. 5 of 10 items did not disappoint, 5 bland. Great drinks. Prices expected and overall worth it.
Companionship the best part.",-1
3,Overpriced but delicious 'modern' dim sum - there are plenty of great dim sum places in london so i would suggest giving this place a miss.,-1
1,"Congratulations Yauatcha.  You managed to kill your reputation in one single swoop upon our latest visit.
We booked a table for our anniversary dinner WEEKS ago.  As requested, we re-confirmed the day before for 8pm. So far business as usual.
We arrived at exactly 8pm, and got our table downstairs as requested.
Upon ordering, our waiter seemed quite uninterested, and was almost 'bitchy' when I asked about a dish we had the previous time. Hmmm.
The music was extremely loud, even more so than previous times, which made conversation quite strenuous.  We overheard the table next to us complain about the same problem. (On a separate note, they were annoyed as well about getting their main course before their starters).
The food quality was excellent, as always.  Nothing to say about that.
HOWEVER .. when we decided to order desserts at 9pm (one hour after arriving, ordering, and getting our dishes), we were told that ""our table was booked only until 9:15pm, so it would be almost impossible to serve us desserts"". Wait. WHAT?
So we called the maitre d' to enquire about this.  He first started asking us if we were walk-ins.  Then proceeded to tell us that our reservation was for 7pm and we'd been an hour late. SERIOUSLY?  How UNPROFESSIONAL can one be?
If we'd been an hour late, our table would have been gone for 45 mins, since they have a 15min holding policy, so that excuse didn't fly! And not knowing we booked several weeks in advance, and then making us feel like it was our fault? NO WAY!
As said, the quality of the food was excellent, but the service is an absolute disgrace!
In the end, the desserts were on the house, but a situation like this should NEVER have occurred in a Michelin-star restaurant!
The whole experience left us leaving quite annoyed and bitter, and ruined what should have been a memorable anniversary dinner.
We'll give Yauatcha another try next time, but if this is the standard they're holding up now, it's bye-bye, never again.",-1
4,"Whilst in london for a weekend, a friend took us to yauatcha in soho. When we walked there, she stopped and said we are here... We just looked and thought really?? It doesn't look like a restaurant outside though through the window we could see it was a bakery.
We hadn't made a booking so they gave us a table for three people and said we had two hours.
We ordered various dim sum, which are quite expensive and only really a treat, rather than somewhere you would go every Sunday like we normally have done in Birmingham!! The waitress told us we had ordered enough as they don't do take out boxes! Okay we got told lol 
Some of the dim sum was nice and some were too unusual for my taste. It is stylish and an Instagrammers heaven ! My friend paid so I don't know how much lunch cost! But must been expensive though we only drank water and green tea.
The toilets are downstairs and the sink is like a Japanese garden with slate steps. See my photo!! There were only two out of I think six toilets working which I think isn't acceptable especially as they didn't put up a notice on the doors. 
There is a bakery with some gorgeous desserts which I wish I had tried but couldn't walk round london with them as takeaways. There's always next time!!!",1
5,"Wow. I mean, WOW! I am blown away by this place. It's not a secret that I love dim sum and I mean really LOVE IT and I've eaten a lot of it in my time but I have never had dim sum like this.
We arrived and seated straight away, our coats were checked and the waitress came over with the menus and some water. I do love it when restaurants do that without you asking.
We ordered a lot of food and when asking the waiter if he thought that would be enough, he kindly and honestly said he thinks we'll be full after the duck but he'll keep everything written down and ask us how we're feeling once we've  had the duck.
We ordered so many different types of dim sum but the real stand outs were the venison puffs, the char sui cheung and the pulled chicken dumplings but they were all amazing!
The duck was also fantastic. Beautifully cooked, crispy on the outside and pure meaty bliss once forked. I love the crispy bits! :) 
By the time we'd finished the duck we were stuffed and I'm so glad we didn't have the rest but I'll definitely be back to try more!
They also brought me a birthday macaroon which was a lovely touch!
It was a birthday meal I will always remember and I 100% agree with the decision on it receiving a Michelin star. Just wonderful",1
2,"I was very excited to try this restaurant, but was unfortunately let down.  I was personally not a fan of the restaurant's setup.  The chairs that we sat in were uncomfortable and really low to the ground, and the tables were so close to each other that any movement to the side results in you rubbing against the person sitting next to you.  The service also leaves much to be desired; it was really slow, and it took forever to get a waiter's attention.
Some of the dishes we got were pretty good.  The pork and prawn shui mai and the prawn and beancurd cheung fun were our two favorites, and we really enjoyed them.  The crispy duck roll was pretty mediocre; you could get something better at other dim sum restaurants.  When we ordered the chicken cheung fun, however, the dish came out very soggy and the chicken was really bland and dry.  The edamame truffle dumpling had a weirdly crunchy texture, and the flavors didn't blend well at all.
I probably would've given this restaurant a 3-star rating if it did not have a Michelin star and was less pricey.  I don't think that the restaurant is worth the star or the price, and would not go back here.",-1
4,"A beautiful display of cakes enticed us into the Chinese style restaurant. There were so many to choose from and I was grateful that we weren't being rushed into a decision. We settled on a citrus based cake, which was made with grapefruit and lemon. When the server brought it over it looked almost too beautiful and intricate to eat. 
We also ordered a pot of jasmine tea which tasted just so perfect. It was light, floral and fragrant. 
As we weren't eating a main meal they seated us at the bar, which was fine. The place is beyond stylish and feels like when you're at your best friends parents house and they've seated you in the guest living room, and your kind of too frightened to move in fear of breaking some expensive antique. I digress! 
Visit the toilets, the basin is a piece of art work in its own right.",1
5,"Popped in for some takeaway cakes yesterday and today for various bday treats. Super scrumptious esp the jasmine and coconut with lime versions. On both occasions I was given full sized samples. Yesterday was the mini moon cake which was filled with a custard filling. And today was a macaron filed with gooey salted caramel. Wow. Both were scrumptious. However I def think it would taste even more amazing if I had with some hour Chinese tea as in their own, they did have a sweet aftertaste...but they were very good. Am definitely tempted to go back for more.",1
5,"I'm not sure why, but I enjoyed Yauatcha a lot more the second time around.  We sat in the basement area again which has a dark and NYC-type of feel (if that makes any sense?).  
Two dishes that blew me away...
1. Venison puffs: Outrageously amazing.  The pastry is light and flakey and the filling is sweet, savoury, and just perfect.
2. Chili fried squid: Coated in slightly sweet, fried oats... It sounds odd, but it was such a delight.
I will certainly be returning for these two dishes!",1
4,"After eating at the wonder ground, we wanted something sweet, I jumped to search yelp for desserts, and of course, this place popped up. 
We headed in, they took our coats and luggage, and we were sat in the blue lit bar area since we were just having pud. 
We giggled struggling to read the menu in the low light and candles (who knew blue light made it so difficult?) Picking cocktails and elaborate puds. 
The seats were tall and oddly comfy, and the atmosphere in both the bar and the restaurant were lovely, and the view into the kitchen gave us a peek at what we were waiting for. (also, people watching through the one way wall kept us entertained too!) Things didn't take long to arrive, and they were presented beautifully, and tasted even better. We plumped for things with ingredients that weren't every day, and there was a nice range to choose from, but ours were just lovely, tart, and well balanced, with a really nice mix of textures too. 
I'd like to come back and eat more than just puddings, because it all smelt great!",1
4,"We went with the hype and tried this popular dim sum restaurant on our first night in London. Make a reservation, it was full on a Wednesday night. Tons of style and ambiance. Request to be seated in the lower level if youre going for a romantic night out, the ceiling is designed to look like the night sky. Stunning. It's very Vegetarian friendly. Try the vegan ""duck"" - sweet, spicy and smoky with the most gorgeous mushrooms. What are those mushrooms called??!  My carnivorous spouse had the venison puffs, he said that they totally deserve an award.  Every other dish we tried was very good but not great. If you're looking for a traditional dim sum place, this isn't for you. But if you want good dim sum-ish goodness in an upscale environment, book a table.",1
4,Everything we order was really good. We had to make a reservation but the place wasn't even busy. Not sure why dim sum starts so late in London. The only draw back here is the price.,1
5,"Omg the chow fun is amazing. I would go for that as its so different than any dim sum dish I've had. It's basically a greasy roll stuffed with toppings of your choice wrapped with the white rice paper with soy sauce. So so so so good! Never had that before. They also had some amazing desserts especially the chocolate cake with rice Krispy in it! Yummy 
It was also our friends bday so they gave us a candle which our kids loved more. 
Spacious as well with super nice service towards our kids. I wouldn't call it kid friendly with high chairs but they were very nice with them&",1
5,"Delicious dim sum! Very trendy decor. Great service. 
Favorite dish was a shrimp wrapped in crunchy bean curd then wrapped in a noodle. Wish I could remember the name, but if you ask the waiter they will know. It's clear everyone knows it's a specialty. 
The only let down was the sticky rice. It wasn't bad, but It was just ok; nothing special. A little fishy for my taste. 
The other star was desert! Don't miss it! We had a strawberry dish. Maybe strawberry mouse? I'll post a picture.",1
4,"A Michelin starred dim sum joint is worth a visit for no other fact than it is what it is.
The food is incredible - better than any dim sum I've had in the US...disclaimer, though, that I live in East TN and most of our asian food options are ""fast"".  Between my time in Houston, DC, and San Fran, though, the dim sum here best all in the places I've lived.
Their signature is the shrimp and bean curd cheun fun - and worth every bite.  Every other dumpling we had was awesome...the edamame truffle stands out, as well.  Least favorite on the list for both of us was the wagyu beef dumpling - skip it.
The vibe is totally cool and the architecture/design is modern and slick.
The only negative was the seating - I felt like I was sitting at desk chairs at my daughter's elementary school.  Both my wife and I ended up curling our feet underneath the chairs/booth, which was both awkward and uncomfortable.  Fortunately, though, the quality of the food combined with a Suntory whisky or two and some sake we had eased the discomfort.",1
3,Nay... the ambivalence is quite nice but theres only a limited selection of dim sums. I hope they can make the dim sums more authentic with more choices...,-1
4,"As others have mentioned, service was a bit disappointing at times but the food was good enough that we left feeling satisfied. Will likely not be back but no regrets",1
4,Not as good as the last time. Food is lovely but this just isn't running like a smoothly oiled machine like you would expect at a Michelin starred restaurant. I would come back but it just isn't doing as well as it did six months ago.,1
5,"Some of the most amazing dim sum I have every had.  Great service, amazing ambiance.  Order the dim sum for sure!  Can't go wrong with anything.",1
5,"I was a bit apprehensive to dine here after reading mixed reviews from Yelpers especially about whether it was deserving of its Michelin status. After one of the best Asian cuisine dining experiences I've had in London to date, it's a must! 
For the folks who want to try Yauatcha / those who might've been and didn't rate it all too highly - this is for you!
I don't ever post to sway your decision to return to a restaurant you mightn't have rated 5 stars on your first visit, but thought I had to share some dish recommendations that you absolutely need to try (disclaimer: I went with a group of friends, including one who gave it 5 stars (after a forgettable first time visit last year)) 
Here's what you must, must, must order!
- Jasmine tea smoked ribs
- Crispy duck roll
- Roasted duck pumpkin puff with pine nut
- Sticky rice
Make sure you save room for desert! 
- Raspberry delice 
- Any of their macarons (yes!)",1
4,"Imagine you're at dim sum with five other friends and you order two steamers of prawn shu mai.  You all take a piece and there are two left.  Who are the lucky two that get seconds?? Everyone is being all fake polite so no one claims them initially as you are secretly eyeing the dumplings, willing someone to just give up already in favour of those with hungrier stomachs (aka you).  Hey, no shame, we've all been there before...
Fortunately this completely hypothetical scenario never has to happen at Yauatcha! They just rolled out their Supreme Saturdays menu where they serve a generous tasting of assorted steamed and fried dim sum for a reasonable price and for those selfish eaters, you don't have to worry about sharing with others :). 
Can't make it on the weekend? Their Taste of Yauatcha menu offered on weekdays is just as good!
I personally am a fan of their fusion, upscale dim sum items (e.g., prawn and bean curd cherng fun, curry taro puffs) but I'm aware it's not for everyone. Fear not, however, as they also serve a selection of the traditional items for all you purists out there.",1
4,"Duck: boo
Everything else: yay
We had the weekday lunch promotion (£30 for an assortment of dishes plus tea, for two) and it was amazing and so worth it!
Toilets have Aesop products. Legit.",1
5,"Yes it takes reservations and Yes it's very good. I went here with 3 coworkers for good dim sum and Chinese and it was AMAZING! Place has a really cool ambiance/vibe and it was packed on a Monday night. We got the dim sum meal which comes with multiple pre-chosen courses (minimum of 2 people) and also ordered some egg fried rice to go with it. At first they come out with some really good dim sum but I was wondering if we were still gonna be hungry after...then the duck confit and fried calimari / chicken comes out and you realize that there's soooooo much food. We were all stuffed when we left. I would definitely go back here. Very very good. Also, a lot of other tables ordered the ribs which I don't know how they cooked them but they looked soooo good too.",1
4,"I am comparing this against probably the best dim sum joint in London.  Honestly, I have to say there is only Hakkasan Hanway Place which does the best in London.  This is the sister company.  It doesn't have that cool, dark, chic vibe like Hakkasan but the food is comparable.  If I have to say which is better, then of course, Hakkasan is a tad better.  The service here is really good and staff as attentive.  They have no attitude issues like some Chinese restaurant and are really professional.  Try to book in advance but if you come here on a Sunday afternoon dim sum time, then be prepared to wait.  That's when the Chinese family have their big outing and eating dim sum.  We had an issue with our last order and it came really late.  We decided to cancel and the manager was quick to come and apologise.  They even gave us free dessert each so we were happy for this.  This is what you call professional.  If you go to some other restaurants, they apologise and bring the food out late right when you are cancelling it and you are forced to eat them or take them home.  However, the one star is omitted due to Hakkasan performing slightly better.  That said, it is still probably one of the best dim sum in London so I would not miss giving this place a try at all.  Must go in London.",1
4,"I liked their food but I didn't go crazy and it didn't make me want to return tomorrow. Here are the details:
One general observation - all dishes were underseasoned ranging from moderately to seriously.  That said, since every dish was made in house from scratch, I think is enough for the above rating.
- Singapore noodles - the blandest of all dishes I tasted.  Sigapore noodles need a (serious) kick and they tried to accomplish that by adding sliced red chili peppers.  Unfortunately, the peppers were as mild as they get... This dish has a lot of potential, but they need to fix the seasoning.
- Beef fun noodles - seasoned better than the above Singapore noodles, but still on the short side.  I liked the way the beef was prepared.  A classic dish that desperately needs a twist.
- Dim sum - good to very good, but also mostly neutral.",1
4,"I am not sure I felt comfortable at this restaurant, the interior is cold and not very cozy, plus I find the decoration a bit on the tacky side. 
Yauatcha is very popular so be ready to share your experience with hundreds of other guests and to occasionally rub elbows with the customers at the neighbouring table. 
Anyway, I was happy with my dim sums and the service was kind and attentive. It turns out that Yauatcha has a Michelin star and maybe it deserves it, but if you're looking for dim sums there's a couple of similarly good (non-starred) options in China Town.",1
4,"Loved loved dining here in London. But I must say that I preferred the appetizers than the main course. We had prawn and beancurd cheung fun which was incredible, I could have had like 50 of them. Also the beef wrapped with pastry was also delicious. But the main course was not wow enough for me with the thai style chicken and I forgot what the other main dish I ordered. Overall it was a great experience with good service and atmosphere.",1
5,"Very nice Dim Sum house and it also sells French pastries. The Dim Sum for the tasting menu very good, for £30/2person, it is kind of cheaper than outside. and it is a one star Michelin. Love it, love it.",1
5,"Obviously this place is Amazon and it's Michelin star is well deserved.  I think the only thing I would call out is that next time, I may just come back for the dim sum.   It was probably the best I have ever had and the black pepper rib eye was only very good.  The same dish is probably topped by the Chinese restaurant at the Royal Harden Hotel, which is amazing.",1
5,"I have actually booked here 4 times over the past couple of years and had to cancel each time for various reasons. Finally with the family over from Australia it spurred to try one last time and am I glad I did! The dim sum was some of the best I have had anywhere! My father originally born in China agreed! 
Of particular note the Chueng Fun of any variety - There is something about a perfectly cooked battered prawn inside a warm blanket of steamed rice noodle that is ecstatic to the senses. Also the steamed lobster roll and Venison puffs and spicy pork wonton were incredible. I would love to say we made it through to some of the delightful looking main course dishes on the menu but we simply couldn't get past the Dim Sum menu. Next time it's a promise! 
Oh yes I failed to mention the desserts but sometimes pictures tell a 1000 words.",1
5,Cool spot. Great service and experience.  Dumplings are delicious and the atmosphere is fun and causal.  If you're looking for a comfortable setting for some nice Asian food; I'd definitely recommend!,1
3,"I'd been dying to try out Yauatcha many years ago when they first opened their doors. Back then though, I was a student without the money to try out fancy restaurants. So fast forward some years and I'm finally seated inside. 
If I want dim sum, I don't need to pay such an extortionate price. I could just opt for an authentic place down the road in Chinatown. So I opted to try a few plates, unique to Yauatcha instead. 
Was I impressed? Sadly not that much. Maybe it was because I'd paid double (or even triple) the price for a few dumplings. Or maybe it's because I'd had so much expectation for it for so long. 
So I guess, if you're looking for decent authentic dimsum, don't go to Yauatcha. If you're looking for a fancy venue, then Yauatcha is for you!",-1
5,"! A Londoner suggested we give this place a try. What a great experience! Awesome dim sum & service. The sticky rice was yummy. My husband liked the mushroom spring roll. 
We plan on going for dinner before leaving London. 
We recommend this place!!!",1
3,"Michelin star yes, but amazing food? Not necessarily. Perhaps my palate isn't refined enough, but I'd prefer to pay for Ping Pong's all you can eat on Sundays and save some cash at the same time. 
Don't be mistaken, the food is good, just not good enough to justify the price or the hype.  Two definite must trys, however, are the duck and any of the chocolate desserts!",-1
5,"By a happy accident, I ended up here on my last night in London. After trying a place close by with an insane wait, my group was fortunate to stumble upon a free table at exactly the right time. 
Usually when I think of dim sim, I think of carts coming by or offering delicious, but often unsophisticated looking dumplings and buns. Yauatcha is a dim sum restaurant that made me feel like a grownup (and that is not something that I say lightly). 
The dishes here were excellent. My group and I ate about 8-10 plates between us, and each item was fantastic. The char siu buns were steamed to perfection. The shrimp and bean curd cheng du...I could have eaten like three plates of that. The dumplings (considering I had about 3 different kinds) were all inhaled. And the turnip cake was the best turnip cake in the history of turnip cakes. 
The plates are small, but shareable with about 3-4 pieces per dumpling and buns. Topping off our meal with some delicious sake made the entire experience complete.
I felt a little out of place with my jeans here, and had I known this is where we were going to end up, I would have opted for something dressier. 
The wait staff and FOH managers were very accommodating, and would check up on us often. Or suggest another delicious dish for our meal.
So many stars. I'm sad I had to stop at five. This place was one of the best meals that I have ever had.",1
3,"Hip and happening this Chinese restaurant is delicious. Sort of... People with shellfish allergies beware, as most dishes served here are with oyster sauce, even dishes that look vegetarian, and what first looks like an extensive and exciting menu limits those people with shellfish allergies down to a a measly few dishes to choose from. And when I say measly, I mean you can count the selection on one hand. This is important to note as one in our party was allergic and this meant that person had little to eat. 
Everybody else feasted. And the cuisine while distinctively Chinese had a modern approach which made for a truly tasty experience. Pork belly with truffles... foie gras, duck, and delightful pumpkin dim sum shaped into little pumpkins were divine. 
We came for desserts, however we were disappointed as by the time we were finished with our meal, the tempting dessert selections we had seen upon entering the restaurant were nearly all sold out and we were left with little to choose from. So, that was sort of the theme of the night here at Yauatcha: So much to tempt, so little actually available. 
The decor was trying too hard with its fish aquariums and Asian inspired seating. The seats themselves were very close to the ground and people were too close and on top of each other. My chair was next to one of the pillars and I had to sit a bit sideways and nearly on top of the table, so it was a bit uncomfortable. And yes, a bit noisy. Waitstaff too could have been a bit more attentive and not so rushed. 
Its a shame really as it is a fun place, great for small groups of friends. I think it definitely merits a try, as what was good, was tasty, but perhaps avoid Saturday night and the weekends.",-1
2,"Walking into the lounge, you're greeted with a lines and lines of beautiful desserts. 
You think: What kind of dim sum place this is? And you're ushered downstairs to a star lit dim room. 
Yauatcha is more a fusion sort of dim sum. Everything we had was typical chinese dim sum but they were just presented so clean and tasted mediocre. My parents remarked that we could get better dim sum for way cheaper back in San Francisco. I enjoyed all of the dishes we got, but I believe that there was nothing special about any of them. All of the plates were remarkably tiny sized for the amount we paid for it. 
The only dish I thought was worth checking out were the Prawn & Beancurd Cheung Fun. 
Oh and this place is the slowest service I have ever experienced before.. It takes forever to get anything done. Food comes out slow, waiters never seem to see you, water takes forever to come to the table. Oh and make sure you ask for tap water or they'll charge you for still water. 
I would recommend just coming here for drinks and desserts. We tried the Raspberry Delice. It looked better than it tasted. The lychee ice cream that came with it was much more delicious and unique.",-1
4,Good dim sum and wonderful service.  Delicious congee too.  The French pastries looked amazing and I will have to try them on my next visit.  I noticed on the menu that there was a reasonably priced special dim sum tasting menu after 2 pm Mondays to Thursdays.  A nice tea break if you are walking around Soho.,1
5,"I've been going on and off pretty much since it's opened and it's retained its quality. Of the dozen places I've been to in London this is by far the best and the only one that comes close to what I'm used to in Hong Kong and Singapore, although I have yet to try Hakkasan which is supposed to be on the level.
Yauatcha brings modern cooking techniques and interesting ingredients to dim sum. The venison puff is a textbook butter pastry with French, rather than Cantonese techniques. The parcels (sorry, ""spinach prawn dumplings"") would not be out of place in a Vietnamese kitchen and are also reminiscent of greek leaf rice parcels. There are a few twists on classics, such as the pumpkin crystal dumpling which plays pumpkin's softer texture against just a hint of crunchy water chestnut (expected) and the oily nasal nuttiness of pine nuts (unexpected). Since the classics are done well without using the usual bulk frozen quality items, they taste different: the prawn and deep fried tofu cheung fun was crispier and more flavourful than expected although it's a shame they hold on to the sauce pot after pouring. The kitchen team here has taste and knowledge and the cooking is consistent. I like it, authenticity gets boring after a while.
They have always had amazing desserts but having not had one in 3 years I cannot comment on whether quality has been maintained, only point out that many tables were ordering some and they still look very pretty and skilled.
The restaurant itself is still claustrophobic downstairs, although it feels less packed than when it first opened years ago. There is also less queue, although it is still full. The audience, visually, seems half Chinese, and sounds mainland, probably a good sign, from large groups of men to lone diners enjoying a taste of home. The waitstaff has become more European.
Prices feel much higher (4-5 GBP for the cheapest punnets), maybe I'm not used to London eye wateringly high food prices anymore, they are high at all the yum cha we tried this trip. I forgot that the ""pot"" did not have leaves and you have to pay twice as much if you want to be able to re-brew. One of the many ways in which your bill can skyrocket here, especially if you are used to tea being included.
The other way in which it does not feel like yum cha is that you are somewhat rushed every step of the way. The seating is uncomfortably low, the space between tables limited, the space noisy (downstairs especially), your legs hit the table legs, and they start cleaning your table before you've even finished your pot of tea. But I expect this considering the location, fame and long queue. If they let people linger 3 hours there wouldn't be any tables for walk ins and the prices would be even higher.
Well, sometimes you want to have some yum cha that does not taste of MSG and frozen prawn and this is the place to go for it in London. Maybe I should try Hakkasan some time but old habits die hard.",1
4,"I echo other's reviews regarding the duck! It was definitely fantastic, in particularly how crispy it was cooked (I mean obviously crispy on the outside whilst very tender on the inside!).
Overall a really lovely environment and I also liked staff and their professionalism.",1
3,"Michelin rated, so you must have high expectations. I'm not saying that they weren't met, but they weren't met with the friendliest staff.
For a party of four, we ordered: (with prices in pounds)
1. Char siu bun - 4.80
2. Steamed vegetable dumpling - 4.20
3. Lobster dumpling X 2 - 9.80
4. Spinach dumpling with prawns and cuttlefish - 5.20
5. Wild mushroom dumpling - 5.60
6. Venison puff - 5.20
7. Aromatic duck (half) - 29.90
8. Stir fry rib eye beef in black bean - 19.90
9. Baby bok choi - 9.80
10. Hand pulled noodles with mushroom
Desserts
1. Exotic pandan - passion fruit, mango, coconut and pandan - 8.90
2. Chocolate lux gateaux - milk chocolate, golden raisins, liquorice
All in all, it was a good dining experience that was close to the office. The total bill came out to be $375 USD. Not my cup of tea for basic dim sum. I'd much rather shell out 1/4 of that price at a hole in a wall.",-1
4,"Having been here a few times, I thought Yauatcha finally deserved a review.
Yep, you guessed it, It's a positive one!
I thoroughly enjoyed each visit to this restaurant for a number of reasons. The service has always been impeccable; especially on my last visit where glasses of water would appear on our table as if by magic. Our waitress (each time) was only too happy to explain some of the dishes to us as they were vaguely described on the menu. Our food always arrived promptly and of course tasted delicious! 
The decor is beautiful inside leaving your jaw ajar for the first 10 minutes as you take in the surroundings. Plus, the dessert display upstairs makes it incredibly difficult to resist!
After tasting a variety of dishes on the menu with each one as mouthwatering as the next, I know I will be paying yet another visit for my dim sum fix as the menu is quite large I (and you) want to try everything.",1
4,"Swanky spot in the heart of SoHo with attentive, friendly and accomodating staff. I was with my lovely gal pal and we ordered a ton of dim sum, some were better than others but I have to say that I think we ordered the wrong stuff. Everyone around us seemingly had wonderful smelling and looking main dishes that I will have to go back for. So i'm going to round up to 4 stars because of the potential that I think is there. 
-We tried the Wagyu beef puff which was steaming hot so be careful and super tasty. 
-Also the crispy duck roll which was nice, dipped in a brown sauce.... nothing crazy
-a Venison puff or something of the like, it wasn't my cup of tea... too bready
- Roasted duck pumpkin puff - meh
and to finish we had the Raspberry Delice totally based on looks from another table.",1
5,"Amazing in every way. I was blown away by the quality and variety of the dim sum and there were so many other things on the menu too! I can't even pick favourites- there's such a rich variety to select from. 
Our waitress was a spitter -what a shame. And those one armed chairs don't cater to big bums so they are a but annoying. 
Malgre tous, They had amazing little cakes for dessert. Oh what a delight! Go forth my children.",1
4,"Excellent Chinese food! Highly recommend making a reservation otherwise you do wait a long time to get seated. In our case, we were seated at the bar. 
Service was excellent- especially for such a busy restaurant. 
Food was fantastic- loved everything! Thai chicken dish, pork buns, chicken corn soup and the mushroom truffle egg rolls were stand outs!
Will definitely go back. One star penalty for not allowing take away service for our leftovers :(",1
5,"""A Taste of Yauatcha."" £28.88 for 2 people, from 2pm until 6pm, Monday to Thursday, includes 8 type of dim sum and tea. Everything is delicious and amazing value!
After dim sum, my eyes were glued on beautiful cakes. When I ate the cake, it blew me away. That was fabulous!! You must try their cakes!!!",1
4,"We ate at both branches Soho and City.  Both had amazing food.  I would give the City branch the win on service although both were good.
We ended up at the Soho branch after trying with out success to talk to anyone next door at Duck and Rice (I believe under the same ownership). Working on the principle of if you cannot say something nice do not say anything at all.
You can see how Yauatcha got its Michelin.  Amazing food served beautifully.  
The desserts were incredible maybe not very Asian but beautiful to the eyes and mouth 
Prices are a value but higher than you would pay for Dim Sim in NYC or Toronto",1
5,"Worthy of its Michelin star as far as I'm concerned.   Almost every dim sum dish we ordered was excellent (except for the Szechuan wontons, which were surprisingly lacking flavor).   We came for dinner on a Friday without a reservation, but came early and luckily got a seat immediately.  Also thankfully, unlike other reviewers, our server was super attentive.",1
5,"Best dim sum I've ever had in my entire life, service was excellent, food came out hot and perfect!!!",1
4,"I came to this location because of the high yelp reviews. Atmosphere was very nice. The food portion was tiny though. I'd say the food was better than the dim sum back in the US  (Bay Area), but pretty pricey for teeny tiny pieces. But I guess this restaurant is one of those places you should try if you're in London. Service was okay, but I expect more especially if I'm paying that much for dim sum.",1
5,"It didn't get a Michelin star for nothing.  Everything tasted great, some tasted amazing.  The dumplings are some of the best anywhere.  Ask to be seated in the main dining room if you get a choice.",1
3,This restaurant was really not up to the michelin standard. The food was completely average and there wasn't anything special or memorable about it. You can get much better dim sum for a lower price. The service was sub par. Our waiter gave special treatment to the table of girls next to us and gave them plates on the house as well as being more attentive toward them whilst he didn't even bother pouring our water for us. This should not be the case at a michelin star restaurant and I can say we were highly disappointed. The only thing that was enjoyable was the ambiance and interior. But there are plenty of great places to choose from in soho and we will definitely not be back.,-1
5,"Perfect place for afternoon Dim Sum! Light, easy and flavourful delicacies made for everyone. You cannot not enjoy Yauatcha!",1
3,"Quick glance:
+ delicious food
+ good selection of wine, including English
- pricey
- small portion (on set menu)
Full review:
I had a team dinner with work here one evening and from the hustle and bustle it would have been hard to guess it was a weeknight. The place was swimming with people, as well as fishies in an enormous tank that stretches across the bar downstairs, stylishly decorated for a nice ambiance. 
As a group, we had the Yauatcha Signature set menu. As a Cantonese person judging an upmarket Cantonese restaurant, I found the food was tasty and delicately prepared, but the portion size was not particularly generous at £60 a head for 8 people. At that price I had expected perfection but was disappointed by the two plates of desserts (one per group of four) dishing up slightly different sweets. (It looked like an error that one plate had duplicated chocolate pudding while the other plate had four distinct offerings - small things, but alas I have high expectations!). 
The restaurant offers a good selection of wine, including Camel Valley from Cornwall, and the a la carte menu looks alluring and attractively priced. If I come back again I would definitely stay away from the set menu, but then again I would probably feel more at home in a less grandiose venue...",-1
3,"Excellent food, abysmal service.
Yauatcha is an upscale Chinese place with a very long menu.  Virtually everything we ordered tasted great, but the portions were small.  We had a table of four and most dishes came with two or three bites, maximum.
The biggest hit at the table was the kung pao chicken.  Everybody loved that.
This place is very fancy, but our servers disappeared for long stretches of time.  We might have ordered more if we could have tracked them down.
With drinks, expect to drop $60-$70 per person.",-1
2,Their edamame truffle dim sum is probably the worst thing I've ever tasted. Wayyy too much garlic! Also the service was really slow and they took like 45 mins to bring some of our food. Vegetable dumplings were good so at least they didn't mess up everything. Bathroom doors are heavy and the handles hurt your hand when you use them. Very aesthetic but the food wasn't good and service was terrible. Not coming back.,-1
4,"This is a great place for a old catch up with family or friends. The vibrant atmosphere sets the tone that this is a place where one can let your hair down whilst enjoying some great food and drinks.
The lichee cocktail was great and the waitress was especially attentive when suggesting items from the menu. Our group was divided into two non - veggie meat lovers and 5 veggies. So, it's interesting to see how our relevant dishes went down. The non -veggie seafood dishes are Amazing ! Our favorite was the dim sum shrimp with beancurd and the prawn toast balls ( which we re-ordered) . Other dishes we tried included chicken noodles , jasmine tea ribs , scallop din sum and a few others , all great. Our vegetarian companions largely enjoyed their dishes too, apart from two that not one of our party , including the non- veggies very much disliked. Truffle is normally something that all of us enjoy , but not this time - the truffle flavored dim sum was awful and the taste just felt wrong ( for all 7 of us ). Likewise we had the same issue with the truffle spring rolls. We could not place it but something was not right as these dishes did not impress and left an awful taste and the gooey texture did not help. The manager was very accommodating and did not hesitate to remove the dishes from the bill , a gesture of goodwill which was much appreciated. Aside from the strange tasting truffle dishes we all love this place and my suggestion would be to try each and every one of the seafood dishes , appetizers and mains as these were fantastic ! If it wasn't for the truffle experience, this place would have got a 5 for sure .",1
3,"Traveling from America and hearing that this place is a Michelin star restaurant meant I had to try it! We have one of their locations opening in Houston so had to taste their prime restaurant first. Reservations were made through OpenTable so it was fairly easy when I tried. We were greeted by the hostesses and brought down to their lower level dining area. Nice atmosphere.  Looking at their menu, it had so much a variety and different twists on traditional dim sum. My bf and I were so stoked. We ordered the Scallop Shu Mai, Lobster dumpling w/ tobiko, king crab dumpling, traditional shu mai (pork & shrimp), prawn cheung fun (shrimp roll wrapped in a clear rice layer),  and curry taro cake. The presentation for each dish was beautiful, they all looked so tasty. However, actually eating it... very mediocre. Maybe my taste palette is different from the dim sum I'm accustomed to, but the price and the hype didn't really justify what I tasted. Everything tasted exactly what it is. The lobster dumpling just tasted like pieces of lobster, the kind crab tasted like bits of king crab. The curry taro puffs were more overwhelming with curry than taro. The shrimp roll was ok... Very plain and bland. Scallop shu mai tasted like scallop. Even the traditional shu mai was ok...  All of them tasted like what it is, but nothing more. All of the ingredients did taste quite fresh, but it lacked so much in the flavor department. Quite disappointing. Did not get a chance to try any of their desserts. Service was good.",-1
3,"In short, I think Yauatcha is over hyped and over priced. 
Positives:
- Design and atmosphere: very posh, intimate, nice lighting, nothing like a loud traditional dim sum place
- Wine list: most extensive wine list I've ever seen in a dim sum place, they also have a trendy looking bar
- Dessert bar: they look like works of art, just so pleasant to look at. 
The rest is not as jolly: 
On this bitter cold night I decided to reward myself for walking around Oxford University all day by coming to Yauatcha. I've heard so much about it and there are more than 100 reviews with an average of 4 stars, it's about time we meet ;). 
So I decided to examine the place by the 4 basics:
- Shrimp Chang Fun
- Chicken feet
- Pot stickers
- Gai Lan (Chinese broccoli)
Food wasn't bad, but not among the top of my dim sum billboard either. Chang fun was smooth, but the prawns were a bit fishy (could be the a different kind from what I'm used to). Chicken feet were a little too sweet and too greasy (they usually are). Pot stickers were okay, not enough meat in the stuffing. And gai lan. Oh the garlic gai lan, it's very good but considering it's just steamed vegetable stir fried with garlic, there's no way it should cost more than 8 bloody pounds!  That can buy me 2 lunches! 3 from Tesco! 
Most authentic dim sum place will serve you tea for free. Not at Yauatcha, where they have a big tea menu with fancy names. While I'm in no position of judging the various English tea,  I know my Chinese green/black/floral tea pretty well, and that Pu Er served with no tea leaf is definitely no more than mediocrity (hence is not worth 5 pounds). 
In the end I was full and my craving was somewhat resolved. But the sum wasn't so dim - it ended up being a 35 pounds meal. Ouch. 
Although the cakes looked lovely, I had no stomach or budget to try any, if I ever return it'd be for the desserts. 
It's not surprising to me though, knowing that this place is created by Alan Yau, who also created Wagamama. Basically his target is Asian food for non-native Asians, and I don't blame him, the market is big and margin is fat.  I should have known better. I do, however, take objection to the fact that this place was rated two Michelin-star. It does not deserve it, and it made me believe that nowadays Michelin rating is more an indicator of the price, not the food.",-1
4,"Lol.  Apparently I already complained extensively about their lack of chinese desserts.  I'm still WTF all over it.
They make mean cocktails though.  And will make an old fashioned out of any whisky they have.
The prawn and beancurd cheung fan was to die for.
I'd come back for more cocktail and dim sum when my piggy bank is full.",1
5,OMG. Going back again ASAP. Okay so had to go back before leaving. Such an experience we had to go back while in London! Absolutely fab!,1
5,"I did not have dinner at Yauatcha but visited the shop part of the restaurant where they sell their pastries. I hesitated a lot but finally decided on the milk chocolate and jasmine mousse with honey panna cotta one and it was delicious. 
The mousse was very light and the panna cotta soft, the chocolate cake moist and the addition of the popping candy was delightful though I wish there had been a bit more. Entremets often lose on texture and taste because of the gelatin they use to make them but this wasn't the case and I could have eaten another one of these right away!
Service was perfect, the lady described all of the cakes and answered all my questions while I was trying to decide and even offered to let me sample a raspberry and chocolate macaron which was out of this world!
You can go in there with your eyes closed and I will be looking forward to an occasion to eat at the restaurant, even just for the dessert.",1
5,"Excellent. 
Service top notch and nice.
Food fabulous, with exceptionally creative dim sums. Not too expensive for what it is, in addition.
Highly recommended.
(only minus for me was desserts,,, whereas cakes look good, their tastes were just ok)",1
4,"Originally founded by Alan Yau, this Michelin-starred restaurant serves high-end dim sum. Craving Asian food in a sea of fish n chip restaurants and pubs, my travel buddy convinced me to give this place a shot. 
FOOD: 
1) Lotus wrap
-Standard dim sum, but very good. 
2) Jasmine tea braised ribs
-Ahh the famous tea braised ribs! I found the ribs to be good, but since it was served without rice, it tasted almost overseasoned with sauce. We ended up ordering white rice, which took ages to arrive, and the rice ended up being dry. Overall, a good dish, but did not live up to the hype for me.  
3) Pumpkin puffs
-My absolute favorite part of my experience. Presented as 3 mini orange pumpkins, the exterior is fried mochi (a little firmer than ham sui gok). When you crack open the puff, the inside has pine nuts and shredded duck. The interior is similar to the inside of a pumpkin- stringy with seeds. The taste was amazing and the design was so creative. It was very memorable!
SERVICE:
The hostess was friendly and seated us when our table was ready. 
The server was constantly unavailable. After putting in our orders, he never came back. Different servers brought us food and we had to flag down a random server to order rice. By the time the rice arrived, the braised ribs were cold. We should have cancelled the order. No one checked up on us. We had to flag down a server down to bring us the bill. 
In a nut shell: Mediocre service, good food.",1
3,"Used to be great, seems the food has slipped, some of the items we had were terrible combos of tastes. Personally wouldn't good back anytime soon.",-1
5,"Very delicious food, great service, and a posh soho venue! Definitely make a reservation beforehand because this place is popular. The food was incredible. Some favorites include the edamame truffle dumpling, and wild mushroom dumpling. The cocktails were also great! I had the Hana Maguey which was a sweet tequila cocktail. The desserts must be good because by the time we got to dessert, most of them weren't available. I plan on coming back soon to enjoy another meal and order some desserts! This is definitely deserving of its Michelin star.",1
1,"Food was okay. Can get better food in Chinatown for lesser price. Worst service ever. Took 15 minutes to get us the menu, wrong charge on the check, delayed serving. Takes forever to get us what we need when asked for. I don't recommend this restaurant.",-1
4,"Good dim sum place. I especially liked the chasu cheong fun. 
A bit tight if one is downstairs. Upstairs is pretty awesome. 
The desserts are more pleasing to the eye than tasty. Still worth a try. 
Good service.",1
5,"It may not look like much from the outside but as soon as you enter Yauatcha you're in for a treat. As you wait for your table to be set up you can see all the luxurious dessert available from their dessert counter; this is surely enough to heighten up your anticipation of what's to come. My party of 6 was led downstairs into a sparkling underground dining area lit up with life-like (but actually fake) candles and twinkling lights on the ceiling that mimic stars. Yauatcha achieves what Hakkasan and Hutong fail to do, which is to create a special twilight-like atmosphere without plunging the restaurant into darkness; testament to this is that photos can still be taken with the utmost clarity whereby all the natural colours of the food are proudly visible.
So, the first impression Yauatcha achieves is certainly promising, but what of the meal itself? Well the menu is an issue...the issue is, there are so many fabulous options to choose from! Plus you are mindfully conscious of the fact that you want to leave enough space in your stomach to consume at least one of the delightful desserts you've just seen and etched into your brain. However, one of the fabulous benefits of dining with a group of friends is that you have a greater capacity for ordering more, feasting your eyes on more and trying out more.
The Duck Roll had a suitably crispy but light exterior with a satisfyingly meaty filling. The Scallop Shuimai was delicately soft with a quality offering of roe on top. The Siew Long Bun dumplings were tasty but easily split, letting out the juice of the dumpling - which is one of the cardinal sins of this type of dumpling; but it is hard to get these perfect. The Wheat Squid was so very well flavoured with dried shallots, garlic, spring onion and chilli peppers that I found myself lapping up all these extra bits until my tongue was burning from all the spice (- so be warned not to get carried away with polishing this dish off). The Beancurd and Prawn Cheung Fun had a beautifully smooth exterior around a crispy beancurd layer encasing a juicy prawn filling. The Crystal Pumpkin Dumplings were an attractive orange colour and delicately handcrafted to give one of the most original versions of dumplings that I've ever seen. The Seafood Asparagus dish was another fantastic creation, with sweet scallop and prawn amongst crunchy carrot and asparagus, all spilling out of a beautiful rice cracker shaped like an oyster. Probably the only dishes that were unexceptional were the seafood noodles and vegetarian noodles which were satisfactory but indistinctive and Yauatcha's attempt at vegetarian duck which was a good effort, with the texture of the duck and seaweed being a nice touch but the overall taste being a bit too salty.
The meal and experience of Yauatcha would not be complete without trying their dessert. As mentioned from the offset, the dessert on offer is enough to make your mouth water and your eyes widen. At this stage of my indulgent meal I was still able to spoil myself with one and a half desserts. The Exotic Pandan Dessert is a remarkable construction of thin layers of pandan cake, cream and mango filling with a shiny delicate gel on top that exhibits an intricate design. The cake is also accompanied by a dollop of smooth mango sorbet and the whole dessert is decorated with delightful titbits. The pear almond dessert was beautifully put together with the a smooth pear-flavoured layer on top of a quality biscuit base alongside a helping of nuts, a dashing of cream, a couple of pretty petals, a dollop of coffee-flavoured ice cream and a musky dessert sauce on the side. Needless to say, the desserts that Yauatcha serves up are truly a treat: with intricate designs, great colour combinations and a creative combination of textures and taste. 
As you can see, the whole dining experience at Yauatcha was exemplary and to top it all off, our waitress, Marjorie, was the most patient, accommodating, efficient and genuinely friendly waitress that I can ever remember having at any restaurant. The only mini-annoyance I have is that we were billed for the still water (one bottle of Still Water = £3.90) and not forewarned about this (which unfortunately can happen in restaurants if you don't check beforehand when they ask you if you want water). So, this aside, Yauatcha is for sure a restaurant to visit if you desire excellent quality Chinese food with original ideas and authentic Chinese recipes complementing each other at every turn. The desserts are sublime and the array of drinks well concocted. The location convenient, the atmosphere positive and the service as perfect as you could hope for.",1
4,"I come to this place as a treat, it's a little bit more expensive than most other yum cha (dim sum) places, but you get a much higher quality of food.
The restaurant is on two levels and stylishly decorated, they can cater for groups or couples. I would book if I wanted to take more than 4 people though. I found the tables a little uncomfortable when sat at them but not something that would prevent me coming back.
The service is high end, with the staff being very attentive and 100x more friendly than your usual Chinese (get em in, feed em, get em out) restaurant. 
The food is probably one of the best dumpling places in central London, they have a great selection and its all made to a high quality. I also like the small quirky takes they have on classic dishes. 
The best way to sell this place from me is... I don't really like Chinese food but I can always be persuaded to come here (especially is someone else is paying!)",1
4,"One of my favourite places in Soho. The ambience is average and it is usually quite crowded. However, the food is delish and never disappoints. There is nothing I wouldn't recommend from the menu. Definitely worth a visit.",1
4,Amazing food & great service ! A must try if you are in the area. Recommend to book a table on the lower ground floor :) Awesome athmosphere & service minded staff :),1
4,"Only came here for dessert but they were really incredible. On the expensive side but definitely worth it for something special.
The only downside in my opinion was that the whole place felt very pretentious and the waiting staff were all very well presented but not overly friendly.",1
5,"WOOHO! This is now my favourite place to get dim sum! 
they are extremely delicious and they have a nice combination of dim sum on the menu going on. Also if you are crazy for sea food and veggies you can't go wrong there! 
I did not have the chance to try they drinks or dessert but I'll be coming back from it! they looks so tempting !",1
3,"Yauatcha is like its desserts - pretty on the outside, above average on the inside. 
Ambiance is great - it's trendy and modern with blue aquariums enclosing the restaurant. The food is pretty good but is pricey for what you get.  I ordered about 8 dishes total for 4 people and we were good in terms of quantity.  The meats we ordered were on the sweeter side. Shu mai comes in 3s which is a problem for groups not in multiples of 3s.  
Yummy to my tummy:
Prawn & Bean Curd Cheung Fun (Excellent contrast of soft and crunchy)
Spicy Softshell Crab with Almond (I could eat the entire bed of spicy almond)
Jasmine Tea Smoked Ribs (Meat falls off the bone! Sweet ribs but not so messy)
venison puff (good pastry but sweet meat)
King Crab Siew Long Bao (one of my favorites - soup dumpling! The brothi inside is tasty)
Meh - wouldn't get these again:
Pork and Prawn Shu mai (meat could've been anything - this came with 4 pieces)
Chive and prawns (bitter, wasn't a hit with my group)
Crystal Dumpling Wrap with Pumpkin (fried spring roll)
Desserts were aiiiite. 
Raspberry Delice - chocolate raspberry cake. Prettier than it tastes
Lychee rose - a lot of things going on, 
Coffee Mascarpone - my favorite of a creamy dessert with hint of coffee
Gianduja Lemon - not a fan of chocolate and lemon",-1
4,"Very trendy and modern but deserving of a Michelin star? Not sure about that yet... We tried a few items and although they were all very good, nothing in particular popped out to us like what that was amazing! Although we picked the standard items, I was hoping for something different, a twist to the expected. And of course I wanted to try the standard dim sum items just to see what they were like. Next time we come I will have to try some of the items they are known for like the Venison puff, Jasmine tea smoked ribs, and the Roasted duck pumpkin puff with pine nut. 
We were very disappointed they were out of Cheung fun but I guess next time! We overheard someone saying they did not have any as the quality was not good that day. At least they are doing quality control..but we were still bummed.
Another random note, the seats are very low and felt a tad awkward. 
Har gau
Char sui bun
Sticky rice in lotus leaf
with chicken and dried shrimp
Chicken feet in chilli black bean sauce 
Sweetcorn taro croquette
Pork and preserved egg congee  
Stir-fry beef ho fun   
Deep-fried sesame ball",1
4,Really enjoyed the spicy pork Sichuan wontons and the xiao lung bao as well as the kai Lan. Service was great. Overall great experience we will be back!,1
5,"Extremely tasty dim sum in London! I have tried so many dim sum restaurants in London - most of them in Chinatown or Soho and for me, this is the only one that really met the mark.
Came here with my husband and in-laws for Friday night dinner and we were all very happy with the experience. Highlights of our meal were the shrimp dumplings - amazing - I could have had an entire meal of them, the crispy duck pancakes (the duck was so perfectly crisp and tender) and the stir fried rib eye, which had the most beautiful flavours. We also had delicious Singapore noodles and a fantastic shrimp dish that I can't recall the name of. The calamari and prawn toast were tasty, but not a must-have and I wouldn't order them again.
Good wine and cocktail list and a great selection of virgin cocktails (bonus for me as I am pregnant!).
Fabulous meal, great service and lovely surroundings (I love the starry sky ceiling). We will definitely return again soon.",1
5,"we found this on yelp and thought give it try as its a michelin restaurant and it is indeed worth it，awesome food especially crab salad and congee, great service as well!",1
4,"Call me picky but this is one of the only really acceptable Chinese places in London that serves decent cantonese dim sum, the only Xiao Long Bao that's matches with an average Hong Kong XLB. 
I am not going to say it's spectacular because many restaurants in Hong Kong can match up with this level. This is average when comparing to a Hong Kong restaurant but with better ambience.
I consider everything else fast food (ping pong or whatever else in china town)..... but this one is the only good quality dim sum place in London.",1
5,Potentially my favourite dimsum place in London. Chefs used to be at Hakkasan so similar menu but better value and generally a less pretentious version. It definitely keeps me returning!,1
5,"Hands down the best dim sum in London. You pay for the food for sure, but it is totally worth it. The ingredients are super fresh, the flavor is authentic and the presentation is elegant. This is not your stereotypical dim sum place where people hustle for food. Don't get me wrong, I love that atmosphere. Yauatcha is more posh and proper, you get tiny baskets of food brought your table with a smile. 
Shrimp dumpling is served at every dim sum restaurant and it is my litmus test for authenticity of a dim sum place. The Shrimp dumpling here among the best I have tasted. They are juice and fresh and you can taste the subtle flavor of the bamboo shoots inside. Everything is really good here, but I particularly like the Xiao Long Bao, turnip cake, shrimp cheung fun, fried chicken chive dumpling, and we can't forget the congee! The pork and preserved egg congee is out of control tasty and perfect for a cold and rainy day in London! 
No meal is completed without good desserts, and apparently this rule applies to dim sum as well. The desserts here are beautiful, delicate and mouth watering. If you are too full you can bring these lovely babies home to enjoy and prolong the whole experience. 
You already figured this is not your typical dim sum place, so don't expect they to top up water for your teapot! They charge you for each pot of tea, which I think is not cool. Oh well, nowhere is perfect!",1
2,"5 stars for the food, -3 for the poor service. I had extremely high hopes for BOTH the food and service, but I was sadly very disappointed. My friend and I had a reservation for 5 pm and were immediately seated upon arriving. Good. Then, we sat there for a good 5 minutes without a menu - heck, we weren't even acknowledged. We had to ASK for the menu. I mean, really? Is it not logical to bring the menu when you seat someone? Anyway, we went for the ""Taste of Yauatcha"" since it included a nice selection of the dim sum options for a great price (28.88 for 2 people). For drinks we just asked for tap water...which arrived 10 minutes later, after having to ask twice. The first six dishes arrived fairly quickly, which was nice. The spring roll, baked venison puff, har gau, prawn shui mai, and siew long bao were all incredibly tasty - definitely the best dim sum I've ever had. After that though, our experience went very downhill.
We waited 20 minutes before our next dish arrived, which might have been understandable except for the fact that the table next to us - who ordered around 10 minutes after we did - got their next dishes (they ordered the tasting menu too) before us. They weren't even done with the first six, which we had finished long before their first six even arrived. What made me even more upset was that I could literally SEE the dishes sitting on a nearby cart as the waiters stood by nonchalantly minding their own business, chatting amongst themselves. After a while we also decided to ask for a tea refill, but were told that a refill would incur an extra charge because they don't reuse the leaves. Ummmm ok, whatever.
Our last 2 dishes came about 1.5 hours after we first ordered. The cheung fun and stick rice in lotus leaf were both absolutely amazing. Again, they were the best I've ever tried. After finishing, we considered getting dessert but the service was so annoyingly inattentive we figured it would be more efficient to go to order directly from the patisserie bar. So we paid and did just that. 
Overall, all I can think about is how utterly appalling and slow/inconsistent the service was. The waiters were not at all attentive - not once did they check in on us - and they also treated us very coolly. Whenever we asked for something, they would just briskly set the thing on the table and leave without glancing once at us. Same thing when we asked for the check - they literally dropped the bill onto the table and left. No ""thank you"" or ""hope you enjoyed your dinner."" Just ""here's the bill ok bye."" Even when we were paying, the waiter didn't even have the courtesy to ask us the amount we wanted to pay - she just punched her own number in and stuck her hand out for our credit cards. Sorry lady, not that easy. It actually mattered this time because the amount we wanted to pay was different from the receipt because the service was SO bad we didn't want to pay the service charge - which we've NEVER done before. Honestly though, they didn't deserve it AT ALL.
Yauatcha - sure, your food is good. But your service is also terrible. So no, I will not be back, and I would not recommend anyone to visit either unless they're ok with sloppy, disrespectful, and terribly disappointing service.",-1
4,"Had our Chinese reunion lunch there. Service was good, really love how they elevated the dim sum, a simple Cantonese cuisine into something so good. 
We ordered
- crab salad (average)
- congee (not nice)
- venison puff (excellent)
- ribs (excellent)
- fried crispy du k (excellent)
- scallop Siew mai(excellent)
- crispy duck roll (average)
- glutinous rice (average)
Stick to what they are popular with, not what you would order typically in a Chinese dim sum restaurant",1
5,"Delicious food!!! The dim sum quality is amazing. My favourite was definitely the cheung fun with bean curd. They added an extra tea to our bill, so they offered us a refund or a choice of dessert to go. We got 6 super tasty macaroons and I was just amazed by this service, since the tea had only cost around 3 pounds. The food isn't cheap but the whole experience for me was outstanding.",1
4,"We went here for a family dinner, without any expectations besides knowing this place is vegetarian friendly, we were stunned at how amazing the food was. 
The people were friendly and helpful, usually known to be pushy, they were polite and tentative. we sat down in these short seats, ordered a few drinks, which were well prepared. After ordering some amazing appetizers, we had a lovely dinner... much of it was small plates, the normal dim sum, just higher quality... One thing stuck out, it was the Wagu Beef item, it was almost like the flakes of a croissant wrapping pieces of wagu beef in truffle oil.... it was to die for! obviously we ordered 4 or 5 of these, but everything here tasted very good, this just won us all over. 
The bakery looks absolutely delicious, although the deserts tasted good, it was nothing amazing in our opinion. It did satisfy, but not to the exceptions left after the food. Great place to have a family dinner or dinner with some friends!",1
4,"The reputation of the place precedes it, which often means that there is tendency for high expectations and middling reality...but Yauatcha (with endless vowels in its name) delivered. It proved to be an excellent brunch spot (my favourite meal, obviously) - delicate teas, freshly prepared dim sums and other hot foods with excellent ingredients, a very stylish clientele and responsive but unobtrusive service. I heartily encourage everyone to save some appetite for the excellent range of desserts on offer too.",1
2,"Not a goof place to go. Very disappointed.  The taste is wired, not like real Chinese food.  It seems kind of mix of Guangdong food and Malaysia and did not like it at all",-1
4,"My friend and I stopped in on a whim, and we certainly didn't regret it. We ordered à la carte, and personally that's what I'd recommend. It's dim sum after all. The quarter crispy aromatic duck was a touch dry, but definitely worth the £17 for two people. The scallops were cooked to perfection, and the chili-fried squid was great. The quality of food was pretty good.
Another thing I liked was that, while this is a Michelin-starred restaurant, I didn't feel out of place wearing jeans and a fairly casual shirt. I don't like dress codes. I come from a city where frankly, restauranteurs are lucky to get people to arrive wearing trousers at all.
Service was a bit slow, and our final bill came out to just over £115 for the two of us--£100 without the beer--so you should expect your wallet to feel a bit lighter after eating, but it's definitely worth it if you want to treat yourself. I don't think I was hungry until the next morning.",1
4,"The week wasn't progressing well in terms of food. One overpriced and bland experience after another. Yauatcha was a relief and a reminder that good food is out there in London. We had two dim sums as starters. Completely forget the names, but they were amazing. Had the home made spinach tofu with mushrooms as a main course. Very original and tasty.
Food took long to serve but that was us being unlucky because everybody around us got plated up in no time. Yeah, it was that kind of week. But at least we were waiting for good food and the waitress was nice enough about it.",1
4,"Yauatcha is a Chinese restaurant specializing in dim sum created by Alan Yau who also created Hakkasan located in London. In 2005, Yauatcha earned a Michelin star.  I believe Yauatcha is deserving of the rating. The restaurant serves a wide range of teas that pair perfectly with any of the beauties in the elegant pâtisserie at the entrance. You are immediately greeted by a gorgeous case of chocolate truffles, macarons, and petit gâteau. The dining area downstairs feels like a very hip night club decorated with tiny lights, colorful orchids, and the bar has a lovely tropical fish tank. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. I had the prawn and bean curd Cheung Fun and the Spicy Soft Shell Crab with almonds.  For dessert, I had the coconut mousse with tangy lime curd, and coconut pandan cream. This restaurant came highly recommended by my aunt and uncle as one of their favorite restaurants in London. I agree...I loved Yautcha also. Reservations are recommended.

5,"We came here for dinner on a Saturday evening.  By the time I booked a table online a few days in advance, 5:30pm was the only available time.  So book your table well in advance!
We arrived a little early and waited at the bar.  We both ordered non-alcoholic drinks, one was with kiwi and the other was orange/cayenne pepper/ginger, both delicious!
Our table was downstairs in the basement.  It was semi-dark and chic, I love the look of the restaurant!  Our waiter was nice and attentive, very good and professional service.
We ordered a lot of food, they were all very good (as expected of a Michelin star restaurant).  But particularly, I'd recommend Turnip Cake, Venison Puff, Rice Paper Prawn and Mango Roll, Lobster Dumpling, Spinach Ball with Prawn and Cuttlefish and Prawn and Beancurd Cheung Fun.
I was very impressed with the presentation of the dessert.  We had Green Tea Choux and Mandarin Macadamia.  I personally liked the Green Tea pastry better as it was less sweet.  Recommended roasted tea paired with the Green Tea dessert was excellent.
We had a great dining experience here and would love to come back for another occasion :)",1
5,"The Saturday afternoon set menu is very good! We were very full after the meal and tipsy as well!!! It was definitely a very impressive meal with various elements! The service is superb, however it can get quite noisy at times. The lobster was amazing and we love the dimsum! It was worth a visit for a good treat at central london!",1
5,"Whenever we Come to London, we Come here.  Service and the meals are perfect.  We onay nerde to have diabetic deserts.",1
4,"Being from San Francisco, where I can get good, high quality dim sum anytime, anywhere, I would say that Yauatcha is up there. 
Stopped by here on my family's last day in London. Since we were in the chinatown/soho area, we figured we can try Lond's version of dim sum. After some yelping, I came across Yauatcha. Hearing that they have a Michelin star, I had high expectations when I visited. The restaurant was huge, having two floors and also a sweets/dessert station. My family and I sat downstairs. The restaurant was beautifully decorated that was modern with an asian twist. 
After looking over the menu, we ordered some cocktails and a few dishes. The dishes are small for a dim sum place but it was expected since this was more of a fancier take on dim sum. Everything that we ordered was delicious! Also the drinks were great. I the only thing was the price. I figured that the price reflected not the food but the owner and status of the restaurant. 
Overall, I would definitely recommend to anyone who is not from San Francisco.",1
5,Loved this place. We went on a groupon deal and even that was great. Need to go back without the restrictions of the set menu from the deal so we can really let loose. Well worth the money.,1
4,"Cakes on their own are happily affordable, but price is bumped up when it's dressed up as a dessert. Impressive place to take someone for dessert. Smart without feeling overly formal. 
However, the tea system is strange- I've never been to a Chinese restaurant where tea is steeped first and then put in a teapot with no leaves..",1
3,"Where to begin on Yauatcha? I want to give it 5 stars, as the aspects that were good, were excellent. But the bits that weren't good were pretty darn poor. It's worth a visit, but probably not a return - unless you're coming back for dessert. So, can we say three and a half stars?
I've heard mixed things about the staff, but I have to say we didn't have any problems. They were very nice, accommodating, etc. Our main waiter was a bit hard to track down so we ended up waiting a bit longer than we would have wanted to order some things, and one of the staff tried clearing away a plate while someone was still eating off it, but other than that, it was fine. 
Foodwise, the wagyu beef puffs and chinese chive and prawn shumai were big hits, and we ordered a second round of each. I loved the scallop shumai (but be warned: I burned the roof of my mouth and am still feeling it a day later). I didn't try it, but the beef shumai ws a big letdown for everyone at the table, as was the pork and prawn shaumai. I don't think we finished either order (which says something, as the portions are quite small - 3 pieces of beef shumai, for example, when you'd get 4 for the same price at other places). 
I had the seafood dumpling soup, which was very very good. I loved the broth (and they served it with a bit of sauce to put in, which really made it taste incredible. But, again, price is a concern: £6.70 for a tiny tureen of soup with one dumpling. 
We also got a couple of mains to share: the quarter duck and the stir fry pepper chili seafood with asparagus. The duck was alright. A bit dry, but decent. The seafood dish was a definite disappointment. The scallops and shrimp were cooked very well, as was the asparagus, but the dominant flavour was salt. It was a really shame, as we loved the seafood-based chili sauce they put on the table with the shumai, and hoped the seafood chili dish would be just as good. The jasmine rice we got with it was a tad overcooked, too. 
For dessert we got a raspberry delice to share, which was amazing. Imagine a bit of lychee surrounded chocolate mouse shaped like a rose and covered in a velvety raspberry coating. So rich and so beautiful. And definitely something to return for - everyone absolutely loved it. The rest of the food? Well, most of the dim sum was a hit, if that helps?
Overall cost was £170 for four (though with only two ""main"" dishes) which included 2 beers and 2 harder drinks (vodka/whiskey on the rocks, no cocktails). For that price I would have thought we walked out stuffed and/or overwhelmed with how good the food was. We did neither.",-1
5,"This is probably the best Dim sum house in London where you cannot get wrong. Asian speaking!
The decor makes the dim sum experience more contemporary and allows to have dim sum for dinner which is totally cool!! Skipping that, the food is totally proper, fresh and tasty without that disgusting oversalty-msg feeling one can get from asian restaurants.
Expect to pay a little more than places serving defrosted dim sum but totally worth the money.",1
4,"This restaurant was recommended by concierge of the four seasons at park lane.
Quite good dim sum restaurant. xiaolongbao (eastern Chinese steamed bun); soup dumpling was very good.Another We orderd a Gōngbo Jīdīng(little bit too sweet) and singapore fried noodle.Noodle is quite good.I recommend this restaurant to any body.",1
5,"Absolutely obsessed with this place. I have been to the location in India and this was ten times better! I will say the menu is very similar to Hakkasan. Definitely order the spring rolls, edemame dumplings, prawn toast and the halibut. Those were the highlights of our meal!!",1
5,"What do they put in their food to make it so tasty? I'm almost scared to ask. Fantastic hot and sour soup. I also enjoyed their shrimp dumplings, tea smoked ribs and famed venison puffs. Very trendy vibe in the restaurant, perfect for taking your lady friend though sadly I was flying solo on a business trip. Would love to go back for more.",1
2,"This is a trendy dim sum restaurant which doesn't offer authentic tasted dim sum. Good place for the experience, loved the ambience, and i just cant stop coming here because the place is tres chic. However, for real dim sum, u'uh, this is not the place to go.",-1
4,"Yes, it hit the spot!  Great dumpling and Asian menu.  
Highlights:  Delicious dumplings and noodles cooked perfectly,  Ample quantity to share, Easy to make reservations, Reasonably priced, Great customer service and Nice big dinning area.
Can improve:  We had an issue with the dessert, our waiter raved about the chocolate pebble and then told us that they had sold out.  So we ordered another chocolate option and it was horrible.  But the table next to us ordered their chocolate pebble 5 mins after we were told it was sold out, and they amazingly got theirs.  I shared the incident with the manager who was happy to remedy the situation and give us one for take away.  The chocolate pebble was amazing but it ruined the experience a little.  When you are celebrating a birthday and the dessert is a downer then it ruins the evening.  Our waiter did not even acknowledge or apologize.  Second issue I had was that we had some food left over and they would not offer take away.  No matter how fancy the place, if I pay for something then you can't tell me that I can take it away, plus I hate wasting food and would rather bring it home to finish or donate to someone who is hungry outside than have it go in the trash.  
Benchmark:  They are really good and come on par with Ping Pong.  I like this place better.
Dined in April 2016 and will return.",1
5,"Really don't understand the people who compare this to some San Francisco dim sum. This is a completely different league of its own and yes I have tried sf dim sum, Sydney/ LA/nyc /Hong Kong/ Dubai /Auckland ... . This is not about size or price and Americans always make everything too big. if u want that then go to a supermarket and microwave at home.  Yauatcha is simply some of the best dumplings I ever ate plus fantastic combinations like the soft shell crab with curry almonds or fried squid with oat. I never tried the meat here so not sure. Only seafood or veggies and it's all been excellent quality . No msg or frozen prawns reheated and soaking in cheap oil like most restaurants in most china towns... This is simply high end fantastic quality. As for the friendliness of staff , that's perhaps the only issue... But hey I'm here for the food... U don't get Michelin stars for bad quality. And the truth is most Chinese restaurants serve cheap fast turnaround food. Not here",1
4,"I'm a bit torn about Yauatcha. First time I went, we had the dim sum tasting menu. Now this was very good value, and it's true, the dim sum are a twist on the original and prepared with exceptional care (truffle oil in spring rolls?? it works.)
Second time I went, we had more standard items off the menu. The dishes tasted good, with obviously quality ingredients, but not overwhelmingly different from the equivalent dish you'd get at a regular chinese restaurant. Maybe it's just me, but perhaps it's hard to get subtle, inventive ""haut cuisine"" type flavors in Chinese food. 
I'd go back, especially for the tasting menu, but what I love about Chinese food wasn't totally there in the main dishes.
A good plus though - great tea selection, and if you order a few, you can really compare and contrast.",1
2,"Perhaps this restaurant is only cater to customers who live in London that are not Chinese. Thus my review will be bias. But, at this price tag, i expect something better. Something better than the cheap DimSum shops that sells SiuMai @ 3 for $1.50 (USD). Bellow is a list of what we ordered.
Tea Smoked Ribs - It was tasty and falls right off the bone. However, it has no tea flavor, false advertisement. it is not different than those BBQ Ribs you find at your local Chinese BBQ shop for a fraction of the price.
Pork SiuMai - It tasted and looked exactly like those you can find at your local dimsum shop for a fraction of the price.
Beef Rice Roll - I actually loved this dish. They used Sukiyaki grade beef instead of the traditional minced beef. the only dish I enjoyed. 
Chicken Feet - what can i say, it was chopped in half, not an whole feet. too many small broken bones that irritated the sh*** out of me. 
XLB - I prefer this dish at either DTF or any other XLB shop. 
The atmosphere was a miss in my opinion. The waiter sat us at the street level where a low table paired with small/low chairs, very similar to those you see in child care places.",-1
5,"Yauatcha truly lives up to its Michelin star reputation. I was skeptical about their food at first, but was genuinely impressed with the authenticity and quality of their dim sum, unlike many other 'Chinese' restaurants in London. As good as the dim sum starters were, it was no where close to the matcha dessert I tried (yes, the one everyone seems to rave about). It was amazing, and no doubt I'm going again just for this. The Lychee Charlotte looks spectacular, but doesn't quite taste really good; far too sour for my liking. All-in-all, I definitely recommend this place for anyone! Good food, great service and even a bar (with a wide range of unique cocktails) makes it a winner in my book.",1
4,"Authentic Cantonese food, just a bit pricy! The ground floor feels quite formal, but we had our meal downstairs, more chilled and relax!",1
1,"DISASTER.  What's the deal.  I know it is Chinese New Years but does the restaurant have to have an unannounced 20-30 minute long interruption with two unsmiling guys pounding on drums and banging their bells loudly?  It felt like the place was taken over by crazies and the staff just stood glumly as the session went on, and on, and on.....  A quick New Years ritual of say 60-90 seconds would have been great.  But to hand over a place full of paying patrons to a bunch of crazies was a really bad idea.  We walked out of our (early) evening reservation as we had ordered wine and had been trapped, getting nothing served, while holding our fingers in our ears due to the noise!
Management blew it big time as I'm never setting foot inside the place and it used to be a favorite.",-1
4,"Their ""Taste of Yauatcha"" menu is such an awesome value (£28.88 for 2 people) and a great way to taste a variety of their dim sum items without breaking the bank! 
The vibe and decor at Yauatcha is slick and modern, but the service is still really friendly and accommodating. The food is delicious and the cocktails are well made and tasty. Of the items that came with the pre fixe, I think the baked venison puff and sweet potato mushroom mei-si roll were my favorites (pictured).",1
3,"Went for dinner and ordered the dim sum. It was delicious. The presentation and flavors were on point. I was def impressed as I've always thought of dim sum as greasy and a bit heavy and the innards always ground up in some mystery combination. Here, it was actual pieces of vegetables and meats that you can see and distinguish...and taste! I would mark for 4 stars, but I felt that 3 pieces per dim sum for the price was a rip off. Also, when you order a pot of tea, you don't get hot water top up. Gotta pay for another (small) pot. Awesome. The ambiance was very nice. I'd say it has a better decor than Hakkasan. I'd revisit this place on special occasions when it warrants me to splurge on dim sum.",-1
4,"Yauatcha is a 1 Michelin starred dim sum tea house.  Definitely upscale and posh, but didn't give it a 5 stars due to the service.  They try to be very upscale in service, so they literally whisper at you...this only works if you're in a very quiet restaurant.  This place is more happening and upbeat which naturally turns into loud in volume.  You must speak up people!  They also need more training in being more observant...there were more than too many times they walked away without looking.  They probably solely get the Michelin for their food, because food is absolutely stunning in its presentation, quality, and taste.  The desserts are so pretty here too!
The two of us ordered the set menu for two people which came with the following:
 Blue swimmer crab salad with sesame dressing and Asian vegetables
 Venison Puff - flaky pastry filled with yummy venison.
 Seafood dumpling in supreme stock - Fish maw dumpling! So good! Great broth and exciting texture of the fish maw in the dumpling! 
 Poached Peking chicken dumpling - Excellent
 Har gau - very nice skin with excellent shrimp inside
 Pork and prawn shui mai - Excellent
 Three style mushroom cheung fun - clean and woodsy mushroom taste with excellent skin!
 Fried chilli squid - So yummy!! Perfectly fried and little Thai chili peppers mixed in the loose batter gives it a good kick!!  There were also toasted coconuts which made it so fragrant and yummy!
 Crispy aromatic duck 1/4 - Quarter of a duck fried to perfection with inside meat juicy. The server shreds the meat for us so that we can make our own wrap.
 Chinese vegetable - crisp, sweet, excellent baby bok choy.
Then two of my kids ordered additional from the a la cart menu:
 
 Lobster Dumpling - Lobster dumpling with tobiko caviar with ginger and shallot. Yes! They're yummy!
 Pork and preserved egg congee - really nice and well cooked.  Great flavor!
 Char Sui Bao - So good!  First note, you smell a fragrant but subtle rose.  Then you bite into this fluffy bun and taste the amazing char sui inside!  I asked why do I smell rose, and they told me that the flour they use is ""rose flour!""  Amazing!!
 Scallop Siu Mai - Whole entire scallop per dumpling!  WOW!
After all that food, we were stuffed, but we had to try the desserts, because they're sooooo beautiful!
 Raspberry and lychee rose - velvety and amazing!  Looks like a beautiful hat with a edible silver leaf on top!  Mmmmmm
 Green apple cake - so tangy and yummy and lovely!  Gelatin on top and buttery pie bottom.  The apple looks real!
 Chocolate orange macaron.  OK this is the only item that's not out of this world...only because I'm used to the finest...Ladurée and Pierre Herme.  But still good.
We also had 4 pots of tea (there's no refill on water) and their pots are personal size, as well as 4 bottles of still water.
The bill was US $233, which's pretty steep for dim sum...but it was an experience to remember!",1
5,"Good food, trendy look. Very cool fish tank bar downstairs. Food is tasty, small portions and expensive but for SOHO London it is what it is. 
Enjoyed their mixed cocktails too, the Hakka is great.",1
3,"There's a lot of talk about this place and it's Michelin star. On eating there, you would only imagine it's there for the service as the food isn't anything special. Well apart from the fabulous Beancurd and Prawn Cheung Fun.
Whilst it offers al the usual dim sum fare that you'll find in Chinatown on the a la carte menu. There are more special and better presented unique Dim Sum such as the Shanghai Blues restaurant in Holborn which offers similar fare with live music
Also value is pretty poor. The tea is by the pot and super pricy. Don't expect refills here. Dishes start from around £5 upward. Service aside, there are much better options when it comes to food quality and wow factor.
Expect £30-40 per head.",-1
4,"Nice variety of cakes and teas. 
Just stopped in for a snack and there were a number of interesting cakes to choose from. Ended up choosing the jasmine honey cake and classical beauty blue tea. Very light flavor of jasmine, but a very rich cake. 
If you're willing to pay for an slightly expensive cake, this is a good option. The service was also very good.",1
4,"Yauatcha is an excellent dim sum restaurant. Its interior design is also magnificent. 
Truffle oil is all the rage at this place, the food is absolute artistry, and the cocktails are fantastically, deliciously strong. The dim sum was beautiful in every possible way, and the ribs are the best ones my husband has ever had. I've honestly never had such perfect, gorgeous dim sum. 
That being said, it still has its flaws. 
I've only been to one other michelin restaurant that was so unaccommodating in regards to allergies. My husband is allergic to sesame and nuts. The waiter straight-up told us we shouldn't even being dining there with when we have someone with nut and seed allergies. Some time later said waiter returned with about six items that we could order (out of a menu of perhaps a hundred). All of them were wonderful and delicious, but it was a little sad that those were the only items they could give us. The vast majority were vegetarian. On the same note, the only desserts we were able to have due to the allergy restriction were ice creams, which were wonderful but slightly disappointing with all the other wonderful things available.
I really, really recommend Yauatcha-- but if you have a friend or family member with nut and/or seed allergies, maybe consider somewhere else.",1
5,"The best dim sum ever, in a stylish modern room. We each had the prix fixe £45 option, and were not disappointed. Reservations are necessary on busy days.
Strongly recommend.",1
5,"This is a nice restaurant. The food here is excellent. The portions are large enough for you to share and order an array of food. The decor was modern and very nice. The restaurant was quiet. The wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable with their recommendations. I have read the reviews regarding service. Our waiter was vet attentive and provided us with great service. The pricing is also quite reasonable.
The desserts are amazing. They are ok display and can be purchased for takeaway. 
I would definitely recommend this fantastic restaurant.",1
5,"WOW!!!!! A friend recommended this restaurant and I have to say, one of my faves in London!! Its like Dim Sum fine dining!! The menu is unstoppable, so, we need to go back and try everything else!! hahaha!!   Everything to share , order at least 7 per 2 if hungry!! Try thier citrus martini!! mmmmmmm! Perfect dinner after the Michael Jackson Thriller Live show!!!  Service was FAST and GREAT!!!",1
4,"We ran the gamut here, family style...
Scallop Shui Mai - 'Mai' favorite. 
Steamed Halibut - Spicy, juicy, tasty...triple threat, baby!
Crispy Duck - All its 'quacked' up to be!  Perfectly fried and rice pancakes were great.
Chilli Squid - Hot tentacles coming through!
Soft Shell Crab - Such a softy.
Gai Lan w/ Ginger - Yum! 
All of it was good. I don't have anything negative to say about this place. It was buzzin' with excitement and although really busy the wait staff was always right on time. The atmosphere is relaxed and pleasing to the eye...a WIN in my humble opinion.",1
2,"Came here for dim sum.  What we got was really tasty....really good flavours and were well presented. This is definitely western dim sum - but done well.  Based on the food alone, not considering the price, I'd give it 5 stars.
However, portion sizes are very small. You don't get many pieces per order.  Most traditional Chinese restaurants you'd get 4 pieces.  At Yauatcha, for the same dim sum order, you only get 3 pieces. Not cool.
They also really skimp on the tea. You order tea at a Chinese restaurant they give you a pot of tea with tea leaves in the bottom...then you ask for additional water to brew more tea.  Their tea pots don't include any tea leaves so you don't get tea leaves in your drink, however, no refills!  Lame.
We dined downstairs and I thought it was quite dark. They've got a huge selection of desserts upstairs which looked tasty but didn't indulge this time.  I probably wouldn't come here again given the price and what you get.",-1
4,"The food at Yauatcha was absolutely phenomenal; It was the best dim sum I've ever had. The selection was great and there were plenty of options.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the staff was rude and condescending (the woman at the host stand, in particular).  Loved the chic decor.  Despite the rude staff, I will definitely return on future visits to London.",1
4,"My sister, cousin, and I had came here for dim sum while we were in town. The dishes were prepared extremely well and tastes great! We had the fresh apple juice and jasmine tea to pair with our food. 
We had reservations so we had a nice lovely seat on the ground floor. The restaurant definitely has a good ambience but I would say the prices were pretty high for Chinese dim sum. Also because the portions were quite small. 
I would still recommend the place. It's something different as to your typical Chinese dim sum restaurant.",1
5,"Really great place for date night with the wife. All the dim sum was absolutely outstanding; I do have to admit that having dim sum in a fancy setting and not being served by an extremely waitress is somewhat alienating :) 
Anyways, my highlights were the Szechuan Pork Dumplings (cheap and very good), Prawn Chengfun (I know it has beancurd but yes it tastes awesome), Wagyu Beef Puff (awesome beef taste). 
Will most certainly come here again if I am in London and you should do the same...",1
3,"3.5 stars. The food wasn't bad, but I expected more. Not sure if it deserves a Michelin star. Trendy and modern, but there was a sorta strange smell, not sure if it's from the kitchen.",-1
5,"Love love love this place, even more so that there's a new branch opening soon, just near HK in Liverpool street. Their mushroom rolls were the one, so tender and yummy. Dim sum was really good, cocktails were amazing. Need to go back and revisit. Also their jaffa Macaron is the best, like you're eating a jaffa cake straight out the box. Incredible",1
5,"Yauatcha is the perfect combination of good food and good atmosphere.  Reservations are a must on Friday and Saturday night.  I prefer to sit downstairs, but it can get loud when you have screaming drunks next to you.  I highly recomment the Tea soaked Ribs, but relally everything tastes great here.  And don't forget dessert.",1
5,"Just delicious!
One of my top 3 dim sum restaurants in town. If I could I would eat everything that is on their menu card. 
The interieur is well decorated, the staff is very helpful and gives you great recommendations as well.
All in all, expensive but tasty & delicious",1
3,"Large dim sum menu and this place was recommended to us, the decor was nice and very trendy.  It looked like a nice place to grab a drink, with 2 bars, one in the back and another in the basement.  The dim sum was good, but not great, and you're paying mostly for ambience... I ordered the Pippa Tofu simply because I thought it was named after Pippa Middleton, only to find out that's an actual dish, either way it was very good and probably my favorite of the dinner...",-1
5,"One of the better dim sum places in London, the vibe is nothing of the traditional sort. Showcases smart techniques that keeps the menu ahead of any traditional dim sum restaurant. You'll leave satisfied, now it's time for you to binge away; cause nothing you order will ever go wrong!",1
4,"I only went for treats and cocktails. Both of which where awesome, relaxed atmosphere and yummy teas. Worth a visit on the treat trail!",1
5,"Dim sans were beautifully presented, excellent taste and vg service. Worthwhile coming back.",1
5,"In love with this place - the food is delicious (even the veggie dumplings), the drinks are inventive, and the atmosphere is lovely. Would eat here all the time if I could afford it.
Wasn't the biggest fan of the desserts, although I didn't try the macaroons.",1
4,"Ambience...is modern, fun...Service is very attentive...Drinks are good but need more alcohol in it cuz it tasted more like juice than cocktail...Foods are OK not bad....Portion is too small for the price.",1
5,"Easily one of the top Dim Sum restaurants in London. Service isn't as good as the food, but when it is this good you can forgive them. Been going for years and years and plan to keep going.",1
3,"We ordered a few dim sum dishes, some main courses and sides all for the table to share. The Char Siu Buns (£4.20) were a bit low on filling but the small amount there was tasted delicious. The Chinese Chive and Prawn Dumplings (£5.60) were impressive as was the Pan-fried Turnip Cake with dried shrimp (£5.50) - an often overlooked classic. To round off the dim sum we had a portion of Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf with chicken and dried shrimp (£5), which was pretty authentic.
On to the main courses we ordered Stir-fry Double Cooked Pork Belly in chilli sauce (£11.30), Thai Style Chicken with mango, papaya and chilli, coriander (£13.80) and a side of Spicy Aubergine, Sato Bean, Okra and French Beans with peanut (£12.90), a portion of Beef Ho Fun (£11) and a pot of Jasmine Rice (£2.20). The pork was decent, but nothing special. The ho fun at Yauatcha wasn't as good as places like Phoenix Palace or Gerrard's Corner. The chicken however was a revelation! Crispy, zingy, fresh, stunning - it was a shame we had to share it!
Being a birthday meal, there was an inevitable dessert with a candle and a bunch of staff singing ""Happy birthday dear ______... Happy birthday to yooooou!"". My brother had gone over to the dessert counter on his way to the bathroom and picked out the Apple Pie (£8.50). Pretty cool dessert with a mousse on top shaped to look like an apple.",-1
4,"Great food, loved the fried rice. Kinda reminds me of Ping Pong Dim Sum. Overall, ggood experience and nice decor.",1
5,"I'd barely recovered from the sticker shock of Hakkasan when I was convinced to try its younger sibling, Yauatcha. I'd been told it was more focused on dim sum and was ""cheaper."" Well, you can say that again. Pretty much anything's cheaper than Hakkasan. ;)
I enjoyed catching up with an old roommate on a recent trip here, and unlike Hakkasan, I truly felt that the high quality and exquisite presentation did warrant the price premium and Michelin star. Yauatcha brings Western flair to traditional Chinese dim sum with gorgeous results. I mean that too, as I'm of Cantonese descent and I've had plenty of good dim sum in Hong Kong, mainland China, Canada, and the U.S. 
The one dish that still sticks in my mind was the roasted duck pumpkin puff, which was almost too pretty to eat. It's a deep fried shell made to look exactly like a miniature pumpkin - complete with a tiny leaf - and it's packed full of flavorful roasted duck. 
Yauatcha is also known for its macarons, and my friend got a takeaway box for his girlfriend. We didn't have any problems with service whatsoever, and all in all we had a pleasant time catching up. Definitely a place to try at least once if you're a dim sum connoisseur and your budget allows.",1
5,"The best Kung Pow chicken I've ever head. I had them add a little bit of spice to the dish to make it all the more perfect.  I was not expecting to come to London and enjoy the best Asian Fusion food I've ever had, but I did. Everyone in my group enjoyed their meal as just as much as I did and raved about it. 
The restaurant itself is very trendy in terms of looks as well as clientele. It was exactly what I was looking for before a night on the town in London.",1
3,"For Chinese people, the concept of expensive fusion dim sum is a bit strange. Not to mention in general £5 for an order of crab siu mai is a bit ridiculous.
The idea of venison puff pastry/pie at a Chinese restaurant is a bit strange, but we went for it. We also ordered the standard dishes - cheung fun (rice rolls), fried rice, siu mai, har gao etc. Some of the dishes were standouts such as the har gao/siu mai/turnip cake, but we were definitely let down by others. The noodles were greasy and bland, and the fried rice was burnt. 
Service here is...unique. Transport Chinatown service to Soho and that's what you get. Not a single smile, exasperated looks thrown at me...not really sure what our table did to warrant it! We ended up having to send back the fried rice because parts of it were actually black at the bottom. We also had to wait over 20 minutes to get our dessert of glutinous rice balls covered with peanuts. When I asked one of the servers how long it would take, he told me it takes time. No kidding, I realised it takes time. Then I told him that we waited over 20 minutes for the dessert. He then gives me a quizzical look and questions me, unconvinced that I was telling the truth.
By this point, I was a bit fed up, so I just told him to cancel the order. I guess we attracted enough attention because five minutes later the manager comes up with a plate of macarons for us, ""on the house"". With the exception of the chocolate macaron, the four of us all agreed that they were too sweet, stuck to our teeth, and we couldn't even discern what the flavours were supposed to be. 
I've been to Yauatcha on previous occasions, and there was not a single occasion where the service was acceptable. Really good quality dim sum but I have no choice but to take points off for burnt rice, and the repeatedly rude servers.",-1
4,"Posh Dim Sum. It's a bit of a weird concept to get your mind around, like Richie Rich having a McD's in his mansion. Dim sum for me as always been that lazy, slightly hungover, still in pajamas, meal that I'd dragged myself out of bed for on a way to sunny Sunday. Although, now that I've grown up and somewhat matured in the last 5 years from college, I suppose posh dim sum shouldn't be that surprising.
Anyways, on to the place itself. Two floors, both classy, the top being probably better for brunches due to the natural light whereas the lower ground has a starry sky effect ceiling which I could see be perfect for late night drinks or a date. The top floor does have the benefit of the dessert and pastry bar which has some truly mouth watering options on display (which unfortunately I couldn't have as I gave up desserts for Lent). 
We were downstairs this time, and quickly seated by an attractive hostess in a very comfortable booth. Given that I had cycled 40 miles before noon, the soft cushioning was a very welcome feeling to my sore buttocks. Tap water was requested and quickly received. I think it says something about the high standard to which a place holds itself when even the tap water is served in an elegant stemless flute, perfectly chilled but not cold, with a lemon garnish. They have a selection of teas and smoothies along with an interesting cocktail list. I opted for a lime and passionfruit jasmine iced tea which I could have happily sipped all day except for the fact my glass ran out and I was too busy fighting for food (it's still dim sum no matter how posh) to order another one.
Foodwise, everything was tasty but a few things stood out. The char siu bun (roast bbq pork in a slightly sweet steamed bun) was delightful with rich tender pork in a sticky bbq sauce stuffed inside a bun so light it was like eating a cloud...filled with meat. The pork and preserved egg congee was a great comfort food and made me want to make a massive batch for myself (must add it to the weekend plans) although it was just a tad too bland (even for congee). We had the usual array of prawn and pork dumplings. They were good, but nothing to brag about. The scallop dumplings were terrible as the scallops were far too overcooked so I wouldn't recommend that.
As most reviews indicate, the venison puffs are another quality dish. The meat filling is good, but the value is in the sweet puff pastry that surrounds it. It seems a bit odd, but the combination of the gamey venison and the sweet flaky pastry is brilliant. I wonder if I could make it by adding honey to regular puff pastry?
The final winner was the jasmine tea smoked spare ribs. The ribs were cooked to perfection and the meat literally fell off the bones. The sticky hoisin and bbq sauce was literally fingerlickin' good and the tea added a mild smokiness to the dish that demands to be added to anyone's bbq repertoire.
Other thoughts...hmmm let's see. The waitstaff are interesting and it's a bit hit or miss if you get a good one or one you can barely communicate with. The majority speak fluent Chinese (which is helpful when you have a Chinese speaker who can order) and that's always a good thing in a dim sum joint. They have a weird policy where only your waiter/waitress can serve the food from the tray to table so you may have a few minutes where you can see your food next to the table but they won't give it to you. Pricewise, it's expensive (I paid £38 and wasn't left hungry but not stuffed as usual either) and only about half the dishes seemed worth the price. I'm hard pressed to say this would be a better dim sum spot than Ping Pong's £20 all you can eat deal on Sundays, but it's a place to treat yourself to some unusual items.",1
4,"I was both excited and apprehensive to experience high-end dim sum as the cheaper stuff is already so good. But Yauatcha offers a whole other level of gourmet ingredients and flavour combinations.
The restaurant is stunning and each dim sum is lovingly made, beautifully presented and above all, absolutely delicious!
Only let down is the service, which isn't polished enough for a Michelin star joint.",1
4,"The place was quite fancy inside all the waitresses/hostesses were in red so easily seen.
I sat and ate at the bar. The dim sum was really good.
Cocktails were good to and had lovely detail.
Highly recommended but recommend booking.",1
3,"Firstly.... This is a beautiful restaurant,  a space that welcomes you on both levels,  the top floor has a shared eating area with a gorgeous sweets display,  featuring macarons,  layered deserts and chocolates.... Very impressive. 
Orchids are displayed through out,  Yauatcha has many interesting features and the beautiful fish tanks are used in away that compliments the decor. 
Sadly... The glory of Yauatcha stops there. The pricing of the food is fair but portion sizes are quite random. The service.... On this occasion.... Terrible... We waited 25 minutes before asking the manager (who caught the bewildered expression we had on our faces) for a drink as we hadn't seen our waiter since being seated. The manager was very attentive and made a true effort to correct our waiter who clearly was failing to service his section. We noticed tables around us were also waiting,  and recieving their meals in random orders and feeling.... Like us.... Abandoned.... 
Definitely unacceptable for a Michelin Star Restaurant. 
The food.... 
The food was good but not great, but I think the service had affected this side being appreciated like it should have been. As I said the food is fairly priced although some food items are heavily hiked for what you get. 
All in all I'm not sure if I should be so hard as to say we didn't enjoy ourselves. We appreciated the friendly attentive staff who ushered us to our table,  the trendy decor, the innovative ice teas on offer and the food was acceptable but it wasn't mind blowing. The table  service where we were seated needs work. If I go back I will adjust this review as the restaurant had a feel of being able to redeem itself.",-1
5,Just had the pleasure of trying this place out when I was visiting family in London and fell in love with the delicious food and their wonderful service! The employees were very friendly and helpful to us newcomers and the wine was fantastic as well! Can't wait to head back to London to eat here again,1
1,"Awful from head to toe. How are you even related to Hakkasan? More importantly, how do people rate you so highly?
The short version: chaotic mess of a service, blaring music, Wagamama-level food.
The longer version: We arrived a couple minutes early for 8pm reservations for my birthday. There was already a queue--of people who had reservations. We waited 40min to be seated, and meanwhile there was no place to sit, no bar, no apology, just a harried-looking man at the front desk looking panicked.
The waitress who took us down plowed ahead at speed, clearly feeling rushed; forget the fact that heels + slippery stone stairs down into the basement =/= me sprinting after you, lady. She essentially abandoned us at our table, leaving us to find the coat check ourselves.
While the upstairs is fairly quiet and chill, the basement is like a bad nightclub. The music was so loud and so repetitive in its beat (imagine the stereotypical nightclub scene from the last show you watched: it was like that) that we couldn't hear our waiter. The seats are super low; neither of us is particularly tall, but we felt like we had our knees up to our chests and were sitting in kiddy seats.
When our waiter finally found us, it was to plunk down the chintzy-looking vinyl-bound menus and run off to see to another table. The menu had plenty of overlap with Hakkasan, so we were fairly hopeful that the quality would be similar, especially since (if I'm not mistaken) it's Yauatcha which has the Michelin star. The waiter kept cutting me off, and so my partner ended up ordering everything. Forget asking questions; he either didn't know the answer or couldn't be bothered to find out.
The first cocktail tasted like turpentine, and the waiter apparently had a hard time understanding why it was a problem. It wasn't a matter of a cocktail that wasn't to someone's taste; it tasted like pure (and cheap) vodka rather than something that cost as much as a main.
Once that was (begrudgingly) replaced, the appetisers started to show up. Everything was decidedly lacklustre, and we kept comparing the dishes to their parallels at Hakkasan--an easy thing to do considering that many of the dishes literally just had ingredients swapped out (ie, duck 'pumpkins' vs lamb 'pears'). Our food arrived fairly fast, but was shoved onto the tiny table in a haphazard fashion, and someone placed the hot teapot right within easy burning distance (and knocking-over distance) of my elbow, meaning I had to kept avoiding it.
Forget getting our waiter's attention for anything: he was too busy juggling six other tables, carving duck tableside, etc. By the time we managed to catch his eye, we were informed that half of the desserts were gone as options and we were pretty much over the ridiculous noise of the place: screaming at each other to be heard is really not how I anticipated spending my birthday evening.
I really, really wish that the Michelin rating of this place was revisited, because not a single part of our experience warranted a two-star rating on Yelp, much less a Michelin star. And the price they charge for this sub-par /everything/ is down-right embarrassing.
If you want faux Chinese food, noise, and dismissive service, go to Wagamama and save yourself a hundred quid.
Oh, and as a bonus, we got to watch a fish dying slowly on its side at the top of the bar-side tank. PETA would have had a ball.",-1
4,"Kind of hard to find or see, don't be deceived by the look of this place from the outside! It's a real gem on the inside, and one of London's top restaurants.
Although a little pricey (hence the four stars) and food portions a little small, it's still a great experience even if you go just once.
The downstairs restaurant has this amazing long fish tank IN the bar so you can gaze at the beautiful sea life while you eat.
The food is what you would expect Asian fusion to be, but not filling enough if you are a burger or pizza kind of person, so be expecting to spend more money than usual here.
The cocktails are delicious, and the puddings are renowned on their own even! People have come from outside just to get the takeaway desserts.",1
4,"Ate here last night with a colleague. We arrived 30 minutes late, mistakenly thinking we were on time for our reservation (honest mistake!) and they were very accommodating. We ordered five dishes: the char siu bao, lo bak go (or turnip cake), duck/pumpkin puff, crab salad, and prawn and beancurd cheung fun. The char siu bao were amazing, best I've ever had. The duck/pumpkin puff may have been the standout of the night, and those two along with the cheung fun rounded out the top three. The lo bak go was made a bit differently than I'm accustomed to - it had a layer of spring onion and I guess egg over the part you expect. Not bad, but I'll stick with what I'm used to on that one. The swimmer crab salad was nice with mushrooms but probably not worth £11. Desserts all looked great, my friend picked the chocolate pebble and I confess I was slightly underwhelmed. I chose a couple of macarons that were outstanding - esp the mango/passionfruit. Service was great, price was bearable but certainly a rare treat.",1
3,"Overall a nice experience, but nothing to write home about.
Our table wasn't ready when we arrived so we were led to the bar. It took about 10 minutes to get the attention of a bar man to get a drink which was a bit disappointing. 
The food was delicious but the menu quite overwhelming. It would have been nice to get a bit of help/suggestions with it. 
The staff made a mistake with my friend's drink giving her a gin and tonic when she had asked for a gin and soda. They then insisted it was a gin and soda, however it unfortunately clearly wasn't and took quite a bit of insisting back that the drink was incorrect. 
The staff also take away plates before you've finished. Be prepared to grab them quick or unfinished plates will be swept away! 
Overall nice ambience and decor. Lots of choice of food. A nice experience but not amazing.",-1
4,"Not big fan of this kind of food, but I gotta say it was a very good experience! 
The quality was good, and the price very reasonable!",1
3,"This is a superb restaurant, the food is quite tasty.  But I was a bit disappointed with the service. Be sure you bring a lot of patience.  Didn't want to - but was forced to knock down two stars - customer service is everything.",-1
5,"Possibly the best dim sum I've had in my life.
I've had my fair share of dim sum, the typical kind where they push the cart around and you gawk at the plates and point. This is not that type of shop.
Yauatcha is super modern and the food is exceptional. The prices are a bit on the higher side but the quality is worth it. 
Must have: Prawn and beancurd cheung fun, seafood dumpling soup, venison puff, spicy pork szechuan wontons,  and king crab shanghai siew long bao.
Service was great, make a reservation if you plan on coming on a weekend.",1
4,"Great dim sum - really enjoyed Yauatcha's interpretation of Cantonese dim sum. I had the sticky rice in lotus leaf, rice noodle rolls with bean curd and prawn, the xiaolongbao, and chocolate blood orange cake. A lot for one person - wish I could have taken advantage of their £28 dim sum set lunch for 2. Cake and dim sum were all excellent, especially the Cale - good balance of sweet, rich, and tart. 
Service is the only detriment at this otherwise very good dining establishment.",1
5,"My wife and I visited this restaurant right before attending Les Miserables.  We wanted dim sum but maybe in a more elegant setting.  This restaurant definitely fits the bill.  Reservation was simple and painless with open table.  The ambiance was great.
Most importantly, the food was superb.  The standard menu items were a tad more but we have the option for more high ticket item like lobster, king crab, and even caviar.  We ordered the set menu for two.  They were all delicious!  In particular the venison puffs was to die for.  The prawn and bean curd cheung fun was glorious.  They were distinctly dim sum  but not like the standard menu item I'm accustomed to at a typical restaurant.  In addition we also ordered a spicy soft shell crab which was exquisitely served with roasted almonds.  We finished it off with lychee rose Charlotte, again another gem.
The only downer to the whole experience was that we served disposable chopsticks.  That was out of character with the rest of the dining experience...  All in all  still a five star dining experience.",1
5,"This place is a treat if you love dim sum. I was skeptical of places with fancy shmancy titles and michelin stars, but now I'm a believer. The dim sum, drinks, desserts here are amazing. The food is high quality, well made, and not greasy. It's definitely far above your typical Chinese fare. I'm in love with the food here! Perhaps the best dim sum I've had yet.
I saw every single table order the bbq ribs, but I personally didn't find those worthwhile. While they were very delicious, they're overly salty and not the most amazing I've had. Hey, I am from the south after all. :P
The service was absolutely impeccable. The atmosphere was perfect as well, beautiful place.",1
4,"I didn't believe fine dining dim sum could be done until I popped the shrimp & chive dumpling in my mouth and was immediately taken by surprise by its balance of texture and taste. With this particular dish, the green wrapper was delicate but held its own against the sweetness of the shrimp and distinct flavor of the chives. One bite of this little parcel didn't take me back to a different time or place, instead it created its own unique experience. 
Yauatcha describes itself as a dim sum teahouse but I have only known it for its beautifully designed desserts (it's hard to miss their display of carefully lined goods that welcome you into the restaurant as you enter). This time around we came for lunch as I was curious to sample Michelin star dim sum.
It came at a price.  For £125 we also sampled lobster dumplings with tobiko caviar, king crab dumplings, striploin beef with enoki mushroom cherng fun, spicy pork Szechuan wonton, sweet potato mushroom mei-si rolls, two pots of tea and sake.  I have to say I was impressed, not just by the creativity of the pairing of the food but by how well it worked. It certainly isn't a place where I can frequently dine but I'll be coming back when I want to try a fusion of something old and new done right.",1
2,"Coming from Southern California, I would have to say the Dim Sum here is barely okay. Given the fact that you are paying significantly more for the food, they shuffle you out the door after your meal as soon as they can (I asked for a round of drinks toward the end of the meal which was immediately followed by a conversation with the manager), I don't think it's worth it at all. Don't order the Halibut - too fishy. 
Granted, I am in a unique position to eat dim sum at great places which are a small fraction of the price but when in London, I would say find another place to eat.
I know London is different from many cities but I was not impressed by the service either. I usually don't ding places for their service because there are a ton of factors involved and many times, there are reasons happening behind the scenes so I only offer that up for information. Drinks were slow or forgotten.",-1
4,"Only had a few dim sum (steamed) selections off the menu but they were all excellent. Very fresh tasting with great flavors. 
A more fusion feel that is probably very much Soho. Lots of Trendy crowded drinking at the bar while awaiting tables. My only complaint would be that we were seated at a table on the edge of the bar which makes for a bit if a non relaxed dining experience. But maybe this is because they fit us in without reservations. - not sure. Would definitely go back. Best to do with a colleague or someone else anyway.",1
5,"I visited this restaurant for the second time in September 2012, after my first dinner back in 2008.
The food is still as tasty as I remembered.
We ordered:
Jasmine tea smoked ribs
Scallop shui mai (steamed)
Venison puffs
Crispy aromatic duck (half-duck)
Everything was delicious, especially the ribs. Many other dinners also ordered the ribs, it seems to be a favorite.",1
4,Decent level of Chinese cuisine in London a different approach to the many premises lining the streets in China town this takes the cuisine of china much more seriously. Good for popping in for cocktails in the hidden away bar at the rear of the restaurant.,1
5,"Food was just amazing, tried a lot of the good recommendations from Yelp reviews, and yes, you have to HAVE to have the jasmine tea ribs. Was just the best thing that has hit my taste buds!!!
There was a tofu dish that was just amazing too, and chilli squid was really tasty.
Heard about this place a lot and finally ventured in. Restaurant itself not amazing, bit too clinical for me, but when you're I good heaven you don't notice it!
My waitress was pretty useless at recommending anything, kept saying well if you like it then it's good, thanks for that useful tip!
But was a great lunch and kept me full for hours!",1
4,"Dim Sum is good but it's too pricey. 
Amazing and excellent desserts: Jasmine Honey and Macarons",1
4,"Yauatcha is a really nice place to come for special occasions.  Their specialty juices and cocktails are all very delicious and look very fancy.  I have only tried their dim sum here, and it is good, but I am still not convinced it is the ""best"" dim sum I have ever had.  I am still searching for the best dim sum in London!  The next time I come here, I hope to try their main dishes as opposed to their dim sum, because the main courses look phenomenal!  I will say in their dim sum category that the cheung fun and spicy soft shell crab are really really tasty.
Their desserts are both beautiful and delicious.  The last time I was there, I ordered the Raspberry Delice.  It was one of those desserts that are ""too pretty to eat""...but I ate it anyways.  Great texture, yummy flavour and was plated beautifully.
Overall, Yauatcha is a nice place to celebrate a special occasion if you have some money to spend.",1
4,"Food: 5+
Atmosphere: 4
Service: 2
Price: 4
I've been here three times, and let me start by saying it is absolutely delicious.  Definitely a place to get a bunch of dishes with friends and try everything.  In particular, you absolutely must get the venison puffs (sorry, Bambi); they are quite possibly my favorite food in London.  The sticky leaf rice is heavenly too...as is everything else, so just order away and be prepared to be impressed!
Atmosphere varies between upstairs and downstairs.  Downstairs has a cooler vibe; while both areas are a bit on the noisy side, it comes across as lively in the downstairs area whereas it was a little more uncomfortable upstairs.  
This place loses a 5th star on service.  Of my three visits, the service was awful on two of them and acceptable on the third.  For the two bad times, they just seemed woefully understaffed -- it was impossible to get a waiter's attention, and they were rushed and unsmiling if you eventually succeeded in talking to someone.  Several times we were told someone would ""come over in a minute"", and then no one did.  Moreover, on one of the reservations, we had to wait for 45 min before they seated us...
Prices are reasonable for a trendy restaurant with nice food.  It's not cheap, but you get a large dim sum serving in each order.  Last time I was there, the four of us had ~10 dim sum courses + 3 desserts + 4 cocktails for ~45 per person and were very full by the end.
So all-in-all, I'd definitely go back and eat the delicious food, but only if I was with patient friends who wouldn't be bothered by the sub-standard service.",1
5,Very good restaurant. Just near the Oxford Street. I really love the dim sums and desserts there. So delicious!,1
5,"Chinese food made so beautiful. 
good dim sum. 
We made a reservation on the same day. The service is good. the environment is very comfortable. Not stiff at all. Good for family",1
1,The shiiiit service ever! The food is not warm and fresh. Either too light or too salty! They don't provide take away and warm up food at all. I will never recommend any friend go there!,-1
3,Good dim sum. Decadent desserts. Excellent service. Pricey.,-1
3,"Food was good. The wait for the food and service was not great. We waited about 35-40 min for our food without any explanation. The waiter was terrible, perhaps there was a language barrier but he was rude to us. Seems like he was rude to Asian patrons. 
Also, they can't pack up leftover food to go apparently because they don't have a license to, says the waiter. And they brought out sparkling water even though we asked for still and still charged us for it.
Not impressed.",-1
2,"I went here with a friend excited for an awesome meal since it's a Michelin star restaurant. However, the quality was not as good as we expected. The dimsum was not very authentic. It tastes quite bland, actually. I'm very open for fusion food but this is not even fusion. It's just like eating chinese food cooked by someone who does not know anything about chinese cuisine. Plus, portion size is quite inconsistent. Some dishes are incredibly small while some other dishes were so much bigger than expected. Service was quite slow and the waiter keeps forgetting our requests. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to others since it's quite expensive as well.",-1
5,"Amazing. Did not do a thing wrong! Duck rolls were a special treat. We almost did not get them but staff said to. Fantastic. Sauces were perfect, hot spicy items never lost their subtle taste. New London favorite, possibly best dim sum ever. If you find the door the first time you should feel good! I spent too much time looking at the food in the window and walked by it twice! Definitely make reservations.",1
2,"I fail to understand why Yauatcha has a Michelin star. Food is good, though for the dim sum / cheong fun / shui mei, you can get equally tasty in chinatown. Service was not great: from the reception (no smiles), to the waiter (forgot to take our drinks order, interrupts table discussion to reach out for plates). Oh, and disposable wooden chopsticks? Really?
Like the rating says... Meh, I've experienced better.",-1
4,Not a dim sum expert by any count; got the the midday tasting special; liked it all. Great presentation and good food. Great deal.,1
4,"Some stellar dishes, like the mushroom and truffle spring rolls, scallop shumai, and the fresh bok choi in oyster sauce. Great drinks and good service and an attractive dining room. Many other dishes are standard dim sum fare, but this place is fun and worth a trip.",1
4,"I walked by this place for about a year until I realized that it was in fact a restaurant. Prior to that, I thought that maybe it was a post-production house (they're close to Technicolor and Deluxe) or maybe a bar or club. Or some other kind of trendy office type place. Turns out, it's a dim sum restaurant. And a good one, too! I went here with a lady who didn't seem to understand what good dim sum was. That's OK. I did. Or I pretended to. The menu is a little expensive but worthwhile, though I'd go to Ping Pong over this, any day. Really.
Awesome bathroom sink in the men's room. I know, who gives a shit? I don't know. It's the coolest bathroom sink I've seen in a restaurant. So, take that for what it's worth.
Sit upstairs if you can. Downstairs is darker and louder.",1
3,"Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but it was more like dim sum fusion.  I knew it wouldn't be like the traditional dim sum I'm accustomed to because it's so expensive, but something's were just done better traditionally. Example = har gow. Sticky rice was really good. The pork belly with truffle was super super fatty. The crispy aromatic duck was really dry. The macarons are to die for. I tried the toasted rice, pistachio, passion fruit and the caramel. All very good.",-1
4,it offers very authentic chinese dim sum and beautifully decorated desserts. the environment is very elegent and suitable for dates. the service is great. highly recommended.,1
2,"I don't like giving out bad reviews, but this place offers overpriced mediocre and very disappointing. With one michelin star and all, you would think you can get something special here. I had Har Gau, Prawn and bean curd Chaung-fen, and Spinach cuttlefish & prawn balls. It added up to 22.58 pounds (including a 13% service charge and a 1 pound donation to a certain foundation that I know nothing about.)
The food was over salted in general and the skin of the Har Gau broke as soon as my chopsticks touched it. The Chaung-fen was nothing special.
The most ridiculous part? I couldn't finish my Chaung-fen so I asked the waitress if she could box the left-over and she said the restaurant does not allow their diners to box the leftovers. If it's a buffet, fine. But when a client has already paid for the food, you'd rather see it go to waste than have the client take it home? That logic is completely bulls. 
I asked for my change and put every penny back into my wallet. Definitely won't come back again. In the future, I'd rather spend that amount of money on a decent steak at Jamie's Italian.",-1
4,"As a Cantonese girl I had extremely high expectations of this place. And I have to say, the dimsum was the best I've had in London, quality-wise. Mmm we ordered all the classics and my boyfriend's favorite was the venison puff. For me, loved all of them (although the vegetable dumpling could have had more flavour). Price-wise over-the-top and I would have preferred to sit downstairs because upstairs the tables and seats are strangely really low. So book way in advance for this.",1
5,"Book early, tables are difficult to come by.  Make sure you have plenty of disposable income too, because it wont be cheap.
But, by golly, this is the best contemporary Chinese in town !",1
4,"The prospect of posh Chinese food in London didn't seem positive. But after sampling one (or more) of nearly everything on the menu over the course of two visits I gotta say: Yauatcha is legit! 
I've eaten both upstairs and down: I prefer upstairs during the day and downstairs at night. Regardless of your seating position, order the venison puffs! Also their French macarons are more than just pretty to look at: they're delicious.",1
5,Never disappoints - love this place. Venison Puffs are a MUST!,1
4,"I lived in China.  Did I ever tell you that?  Yeah.  Soz.  I totally did though.  And then I came home to Engerland and was all ""show me the dimsum"" and some people did but they were wrong. WRONG.  It wasn't proper dimsum.  It was stupid.  I didn't like it.  And then my boss took me to Yauatcha and I was all . . . what is this?  Amaze.  They've got turnip cakes and chicken feet.  But it's POSH.  This is culinary mentalness on a whole other level where the level is one of joy in my mouth.
I used to think that all they served was cakes cos that's what they have in the windows - you know, those well pricey macaroons and stuff - and the windows are fully glass and blue (like, bright blue) and it looks Expensive and it is.  But dimsum - well, it ain't cheap, not even in China (where I lived), depending on who's paying, so you can't really go with an empty purse or expect to skimp and still get the good bits.  It's not peasant food, like beef and tomatoes or special fried rice (which are nice too but not in the same way).  Still you get used to seeing the same old crap in Chinatown and some of that's here but this is the Good Stuff, like stuff from China, the original stuff.
Yeah, the starry-ceilinged downstairs with background reed flute music harks of Chessington World of Adventures and the bathroom is very S&M dungeon (with Aesop hand-soap) and the tables are so low that the waiters can't hear when you order, but blimey is the food tasty.
I've always been too full after stuffing my face with dimsum and a main course (it's not how they do it in China, WHERE I LIVED, but when the boss is paying, you do what you're told) so I've never had a pudding, but they look utterly epic.  One day I will.  Somebody take me to Yauatcha and buy me a macaroon, won't you?  And I'll order the dimsum since I know these things (from when I lived in China) so everyone's a winner.
The oolong tea costs £8.  Don't order it.",1
5,"I still can't believe that I have never sampled the wares at Yauatcha. 
I've often wandered past the minimalist windows and admired their intricate and delectable delights, but until this week I had never set food inside this temple of simple but divine Dim Sum. 
Despite the decor making the place feel slightly like a hotel lobby bar, the food was sublime. We were being treated by a regular who steered us towards some of his Dim Sum favourites and we were rewarded with classics like a moist and savoury Char Sui Bao, the most perfect jasmine smoked ribs and some surprising but delicious 'venison balls'. 
Less awe-inspiring ,but all the while excellently executed, were the prawn and mango crispy parcels, the singapore and mushroom dumplings, but the pumpkin dumplings and superlative soft shell crab (you simply must order it) made up for it. 
The proof being in the pudding, the dessert here was always going to be outstanding. I'm glad to say we were not disappointed when we tucked in to our choices. Sometimes pretty asian versions of French pastries can be a delight to behold but a little disappointing on the tongue, not so at Yauatcha - everything we tasted was exquisite, as well as photogenic. So much so that we bought more to take away for 'tomorrow'...or maybe just a midnight snack!
Oh you should also seek out the mandarine and spicy chili fruit juice in the drinks menu - lip-smackingly good!",1
5,"Amazing dim sum - really enjoyed Yauatcha's.
All we ate was the Dim Sum, we tried many different types.
The Scallops ones were our favourite.  Would definetely go again",1
4,"The service was ok, the food presentation looks good. I also enjoy the dinner. It really hit my taste bud, recommend to try.",1
3,"this was really disappointing for a Michelin star restaurant. 
venison puffs were good at first, but then too rich towards the end. 
pan-fried turnip cake were THE BEST of the evening. i really liked them alot. 
duck rolls were okay, not too much flavors in there. the sauce would've greatly improved it, but it was way too sweet. 
duck pumpkin puffs were aesthetically really cool, but wasn't a ""wow-er""
lobster dim sum- eh... not seasoned enough. 
crystal dumplings with pine nuts- okay, nothign amazing. but this could've been my fault b/c i thought it would have shrimp in it and it didnt. 
service also wasn't really great, not very attentive and ALL the dessert that i wanted to try was out. it was really disappointing.",-1
5,"Restaurant Yauatcha
What a treat that you can find so many great asian food places in london!
In the well known busy theatre and restaurant area Soho, there is for instance Yauatcha, from the same owner as the very famous restaurant Hakkasan. If you make a reservation and that is quiet necessary, ask for a table downstairs and then preferably for table 21( for 2 persons), table 16 or 20(both for 6 to 8 persons). From these tables you have a lovely view into the kitchen. Start your evening at the bar and try out one of their delicious cocktails. We, as non alcohol drinkers, tried the lime-cucumber-yasmin ice tea. Devine drink.
From the dinning menu we tried and shared the following dishes; lobster dumpling with tobiko caviar, spinach ball with prawn and cuttlefish, steamed king crab roll, fried chili squid, crispy duck roll, hot&sour soup with trumpet mushrooms and our absolute favorite of the evening ; spicy aubergine with sato beans, okra and french beans with peanut. What a treat! And last but not least, the deserts are finger licking good. You can also go there for lunch or make a reservation for their outstanding high tea.",1
4,"Oh Yauatcha, you had me at spicy szechuan wontons....
My friend sent me a list of restaurant recommendations for a quick trip to London and this was at the top of the list. I was skeptical that any dim sum restaurant could be michelin-rated. Dim sum is dim sum. Boy was I wrong...
We arrived early for our reservation. After standing around for a few minutes, they took us to a table downstairs. The place was packed. I started with a peach tea smoothie. Yummy, but nothing I haven't had before. Then the food started arriving.
First up, spicy szechuan wontons. One bite into the thing and I was convinced. Dim sum is not just dim sum. After we ate the wontons, my husband proceeded to lick up the spicy sauce. 
Next was the pan-fried turnip cake. I didn't even order this - I ordered the pan-fried taro cake but my American accent must have tripped them up. Oh well, I ate it anyway. And boy was I glad I did. This thing was awesome! It was pan-fried with eggs and chives (or scallions?). Mmmm...best mistake ever. 
While everything was good, those were the two dishes that really stuck out at me. Other things we had - crispy duck roll (kind of disappointing), prawn cheung fun (good but not that different from other dim sum places), sticky rice in lotus leaf (good but, like the cheung fun, it was similar to what you'd get at other dim sum places), poached peking dumpling (spicy but delicious), spring onion puff (good, not great). I can't remember what else. 
Then came the egg white and salted fish fried rice. This was a bowl of deliciousness. I still crave this. After all of this, we were stuffed. But we ordered some more szechuan wontons anyway. My husband complained about being too full but drank all the sauce again anyway. 
I'm kind of bummed we didn't try more stuff from the menu. I love dim sum and Yauatcha was a nice surprise.",1
2,"mediocre food, mediocre menu. Should've gotten a 3 but the place was ridiculously chaotic in my experience. I made reservation for 2:30, they made us wait near the entrance where kids and strollers are running around all over the place. Stressed out with low blood sugar level, it was a bad start to begin with.
To the menu. I saw guotie (potstickers) on the menu, it was a chinese wait staff so I spoke in Chinese. and she repeated my order saying that it's steamed dumplings. I was like guotie HAS to be fried. that's the meaning of the words. She pointed to the english translation that it's steamed. If that's the case the chinese name should've been jiaozi  definitely NOT guotie .
To the hongyouchaushou  . It's a shanghainese dish and shanghainese dumpling wrappers are different from the cantonese ones. Ours are made with just white flour. The fact that they used Cantonese dumpling wrapper for my hongyouchaushou   is borderline offensive.
Overall the quality of the food wasn't that great. I much prefer Shanghai Blues for similar price and much better ambience. The bill took forever to come and the place is just poorly organized. I'm glad that I tried it and checked it off the list but probably won't go back there again.",-1
2,"Used to be one of my favourite place - just went for lunch and shocked by how bad the food has got to... Maybe the chef left?! Or regular chef was on holiday as I went between Christmas and new year's. Food was all somewhat cold and just horrible texture and flavour in most dishes. Very disappointed. The have taste of yuacha between 2 and 6 on weekdays - best deal ever so if you want to try..  Am sure you will walk out satisfied... Otherwise, you will most probably walk out thinking you had overpaid.",-1
4,"Great spot for an occasion or a pre-going out dinner. Fusion food, loungy music. Kinda people watching spot where everyone is proper and well dressed. Make sure to reserve well in advance as it gets very crowded. Choose to sit downstairs to enjoy the blue aquarium and cool lighting.
Easy to get overwhelmed by all the choices of dim sum. Best to choose a selection of three/four (3 pieces each) so 9/12 total and you are all set. Around £25/person with tea. Fair price. Have had more expensive meals in Chinatown in a less pleasant atmosphere. 
It was my birthday and they brought a complimentary plate of macarons and a candle.  Nice touch
One star off for the service, I had booked at 830pm and we had to wait in the entrance for 30min so our table would be ready. Crowd accumulates in the entrance area so not super cool to wait there. However, you can check out the offer of macarons and pretty cakes overlooking the street... And not too much leg room under the table. 
In a nutshell: original, tasty dim sum in a chic atmosphere",1
5,"We found the experience surprisingly wonderful. From the moment you walk in the decor stands out. Food wise, the dumplings were superb, especially shrimp and chive (i did judge it by the look). We also had the scallop and lotus main course, a perfect combo of smooth scallop and crunchy lotus. Don't forget dessert. We shared a beautifully presented macaroon filled with vanilla creme fresh, paired with a tart plum, just a perfect ending to a lovely evening.",1
4,"Is memory playing tricks , or are standards slipping here ?
 A recent Saturday lunch here was marred by a few things. First, the reduced size of the menu ( relative to days of yore, circa 2009), means that some of the ""wow"" factor dishes have disappeared. I lament, in particular, the passing of the salt-and-pepper quail. The venison puffs , which used to be so ethereal, are now merely nice. Worse still, some dishes I swear could have come from any one of a dozen places in Chinatown - pleasant, but wholly undistinguished.
 The drinks, as has been noted, are something of a stitch up - no mid-range sake, for example, only the cloudy version ( which comes in an effete pink bottle fit for Barbie and Ken, and can only be drunk cold). Brief discussion of the situation with staff suggested that they were pretty clueless on this score - not actually their fault if the leadership is not educating them.
 Saving graces ? Well the macaroons are still gorgeous, and the (much reduced) dessert menu does offer delights such as the Coconut Charlotte, so light and otherworldly I'd imagine it's the kind of thing angels eat as a holiday treat. The people inside are much prettier than in your average central London dim sum factory. It's not the place to come, perhaps, for a slap-up feed, but you'll be aware that you could have had something 75 % as good for 50% of the price elsewhere.",1
2,"As I write this review, I'm reading the ones on the side, and I really have no idea why people are giving this place such good reviews. Either a) they don't really know good dim sum or b) they love spending money. Now I didn't walk in expecting much, but Yauatcha is everything that is wrong with Asian food in London. It's thoughtless and almost insultingly Westernised. Like honestly, if you're going to do dim sum, at least keep it somewhat fresh and relatively cheap. That's the whole point....",-1
2,"I've only had the desserts so far as we popped in after a late lunch at my favourite Vietnamese restaurant nearby, and if I were judging solely on desserts I'd give the place 5 stars... But the service here sucks, big time. Despite the place being half empty they were really cagey about giving us a table in the first place, and when we sat down it took some time for them to take our order. It then took considerably longer for them to serve us our desserts and tea, which is the only thing we ordered. When it came to paying we asked for the bill 3 times and it never came, and it was only when we got up and went to what looked like the manager that we got our bill, obviously with an 'optional' service charge already included.
We also wanted to buy some sweets to take away but that took absolutely ages too, despite me going behind the counter and actually jumping up and down to try and attract their attention.
The only redemption was that the same person who looked like the manager didn't charge for some of the chocolates, but I think that's actually because he was just trying to be nice to my lady friend (who is of course, a hottie)!
Annoyingly though, I will have to return to try the dim sum because of all the other badass reviews saying how great it is!",-1
3,"Food was good- had the venison puffs, prawn cheun fun, szechuan wanton, somerset lamb and noodles. 
The atmosphere is very loud, we couldn't hear each other across the table and as a couple we got seated on a table sandwiched between parties.
Service was good, but food was very slow coming.... one dish at a time.",-1
4,"My mother was in town recently and we all went out for a final dinner at Yauatcha. 
The Food was delish. Simply presented, but every mouthful was an experience. To quote my boyfriend: ""the food was blindingly good."" The food came out in a well paced manner where we were never waiting for food, nor did we feel rushed, even though we had a return time on the table reservation. Our Waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable. 
The room itself was open and nice enough - not unpleasant, but not somewhere you would want to hang out for an extended amount of time. not to mention the music was a bit thumpy, although the chairs were so low that my ankles hurt from being cramped. It actually was so uncomfortable that i had to half take off my heels under the table. 
Im rather glad i didnt see the bill. i have a feeling it was not for the light of pocket.",1
4,Very good dim sum!! Portions are small so getting many dishes is definitely an option. A little pricey but I would go back. Atmosphere is very sleek modern and fresh.,1
5,"One of my favourite spots to eat in London. I've never been disappointed. The wait staff are friendly and the menu is absolutely awesome. 
Menu musts include:
Prawn and bean curd  Cheun fun 
Venison puffs
Pan-fried turnip cake
Sesame prawn toast
Stir-fry striploin beef with deep-fried dough
Stir-fry beef ho fun",1
5,"Great place for dim sum... I've always wanted to try it and went a couple of weeks ago. While I have eaten many a dim sum in my lifetime, this was truly exceptional - from the creative and refreshing of traditional dishes, to the high quality of everything, including the steamed dumpling skins.
 Its definitely more expensive than what you would pay at other good dim sum restaurants in London, but in my mind it was also still worth the money.

5,"I've only had dim sum a few times before, but I don't think I'm going to find dim sum as good this again soon. We didn't really know what to order so we asked the waiter to put together a menu for us. Everything tasted great! Although you usually get 3 pieces when you order, we were 4 and got one piece each which made it easy to share. The service was great. 
My only criticism is you didn't have that much room for your legs under the table - if you're more than about 5'8"" :)",1
3,"A nice restaurant which is decorated contemporary in style. For example, the sink in the toilet is like a garden water feature!
The food though was just ""OK"". Nothing special to the normal dim sum you can have in any Chinatown whether its in London or elsewhere.
Also, its very expensive for what it is. Luckily when I went I didnt pay and the person who paid had a voucher he got for his birthday.",-1
5,Uau! What an amazing restaurant. Everything is amazing. Have to go there every time I visit London!,1
3,"I struggled whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars and admit I am somewhat biased as I enjoy amazing, authentic Chinese food near home.  In the end, I rounded down simply because I was not really wowed with many of their offerings.  The food was good but not amazing and probably not worth the overall cost.  If cost is no concern, I am happy to recommend trying this place and I would definitely go back just with tempered expectations.  I'll join the crowd who questions how this establishment earned a Michelin star, but good on them for doing so.",-1
3,"Yauatcha is pretty much an upmarket yum cha (dim sum) restaurant.  Our evening there was a mix of good and bad, so this is why I have given it an average rating.
When I make a booking at a restaurant for 8pm, I expect to be seated at the table when I turn up on time.  Instead, we were waiting at the bar for half an hour before our table was ready.  If they are intending for you to buy drinks at the bar before your meal, then I feel they should have a no reservations policy.  When I made the booking, they told me that I would need to vacate the table by 10pm.  Fortunately this wasn't an issue for us tonight.
The restaurant is pretty loud and it didn't help that the tables were so close together.  I think this is a trendy restaurant.  There were a few parties of friends who had come for drinks and to try the nice-looking desserts.
Notwithstanding all this, I thought the dishes were excellent.  We got 8 dishes for dinner, a dessert each and a pot of jasmine tea (and a refill).  The prices ranged from £4.60 for a plate of 3 venison puffs to £13.50 for a plate of jasmine ribs.  The ribs were really delicious - the meat fell of the bones and was very tasty.  The desserts were very nice, but not outstanding.",-1
4,"I do think coming to Yauatcha means attempting to appreciate the modern take on Chinese food rather than vouching for its authenticity.  There's no way this swanky restaurant can be your traditional dim sum hot spot when it serves macarons instead of gelatin (oh you know the Chinese love their jelly) in its front display.
Keeping that mind, I booked a table for one on a weekday.  That's how I roll- a lone ranger even in restaurants serving dishes meant for sharing.  It was very quiet at noon, though I suspect the weekend lunch crowds are more painful.
Ordered the below:
Guava smoothie- loved!
Pork and prawn shui mai 4 pcs- your typical shui mai, served with a heftier price tag
King crab Shanghai siew long bun 3 pcs- skin was thin, soup was plentiful
Venison puff 3 pcs- loved! I couldn't stop eating this
Pan-fried turnip cake 2 pcs- turnip cake with a twist, I think there was egg in it
Roasted duck pumpkin puff 3 pcs- this looked better than it tasted, wasn't bad though
Sticky rice in lotus leaf 2 pcs- typical sticky rice
Macarons in the front display- interesting flavors (Chocolate Mint and Christmas Cake was my favorite) but a bit meaty
Overall I really enjoyed it here, but next time I would bring along several partners in crime and order the less traditional dishes.",1
5,"Shou mai are amazing, had the pork belly stirfry which was really tasty and had the jasmine ribs which were the best ribs ive had in a long time, proper chinese sticky ribs, amaaaaaaaaaaaaazing. But its a posh place and aint cheap, but very very worth it.",1
5,"I could probably live on Venison puffs alone.The price is high, but the quality is always stellar.",1
5,"Want clean, fresh, and unique dim sum? This is the spot! Being the less expensive sister restaurant of Hakkasan in my opinion Yauatcha is better in taste and originality. When I ate at Hakkasan I was not impressed. It just reminded me of eating at a really good normal dim sum place I'd find in Chinatown. The service, decor and ambiance is impeccable and the food is too die for! Each bite kept me guessing and pleasantly surprised. You won't be disappointed. Try it!",1
3,"Nice place for a date, but not super romantic. Staff is good and friendly, but sometimes they fail to notice when they are needed. Food is of a good standard. Desserts were ok but not impressive in taste, display was great thou. Generally, nice and pleasant experience.",-1
4,"Delicious dimsum but quite expensive compared to the nearby restaurants in china town. But you get what you paid for I guess as the atmosphere and service are nicer and you wouldn't have to deal with the chaos at normal Chinese restaurants.
I love their 3 styles mushroom cheungfun, you can't get this anywhere (or at least all the many Chinese restaurant I've been to). They have great selection of teas too and the smoothie fruity teas are my favourites.
If I'm craving for a quick dimsum fix, I'll go to Chinatown. If I'm in the mood for better quality dimsum (esp for dinner time as most restaurants in china town stop serving dimsum from 5pm) and nicer atmosphere and staff who treat me like their customer I will go to yauatcha.
Make sure you make reservation I you wanna go here for dinner on the weekends, or prepare to wait for apprx 1 hour. This place is packed and noisy at dinner normally on Fri and Sat.",1
3,"My review is base on the variety of dim sum items and the creative dim sum dishes offer.  Price wise is steep but very upscale restaurant and nice display of desert which was eye catching.  This is one of the few restaurant where we paid $150 USD just for dim sum.  We ordered the smoke tea ribs (good), har gow (good), chicken feet (good), pumpkin duck puff (sold out) ordered crispy duck rolls (ok) instead, spicy pork wontons (ok), chinese bbq pork steam bun (ok), king crab dumpling (ok), and sieu long bao (very good).  We also ordered steam rice but it didn't come when our dim sum arrived we have to asked for it twice to get.  Service was ok, not great.  Overall, it was good upscale experiences when travel but we will not go here for our usual dim sum fix.",-1
4,"Please note what what other reviewers said - this isn't the place where people push the carts around.  This is more a la carte style, which is a nice change if you want to avoid the loud and busy atmosphere of traditional dim sum.  With that being said, they have the best dim sum and the most creative drinks!  The ambiance is upscale, chic but laid back.  Perfect for a morning dim sum date.  I love the beautiful decor of Yauatcha, and the food matched the ambiance!  All the presentation was top notch and tasted heavenly.  My favorite was the sticky rice in lotus leaf! Don't forget to order their drinks as well - you won't regret it!",1
5,Good food! Good service! Nice atmosphere... Dimsums and the desserts are really good ... Enjoy !,1
5,"Definitely my favourite place in London, even better than its older brother Hakkasan.
I need to admit I don't really like Chineese food, but Yauatcha is an exception.
All the times I have been here, I always asked the waiter to bring a dim sum selection (they can tailor to your taste if you tell them what you like) as starters: my favourite is the white roll with mushrooms, don't know the name though. Also try the crispy duck salad, is really tasty.
As main, there is only one option for me: the crispy duck! It is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, litteraly my flatmate and me have been addicted to it for months last winter...it is tasty, the meat is tender, the sauce is great, pancakes are good...the best main you can have here. All the other stuff are pretty good too, but this one deverves to be tried at least once. 
You might think that Asian places don't serve good desserts, but here you have some delicious ones: my favourite is the Coconut Charlotte, but also the chocolate delice is very good. 
There are some very nice cocktails as well, fruity and colourful, and a good wine selection, even if I always end up taking the asian beer (I think Sapporo is the one I like better).
The place is very nice, the street level floor is elegant and clean, but the best part is the lower ground floor with a blue lighting and a huge acquarium at the bar: Since the first time I came, I felt like to be in a ""movie restaurant"", the places where the characters usually meet for a date or a chat in the movies.
The only problem is that it is so popular these days that finding a table and even making a reservation is a nightmare, over the weekend tables are booked since mid week! They offer various time slots, at 6.30, 8.30 and 10.30 for dinner and if you are lucky and call on the same day you can find something at 6.30 only...
I can't wait to go back to London to come here again!",1
4,"Delicious dim sum, but not so good as to justify the price. You are definitely paying for atmosphere. The presentation of the desserts is remarkable.",1
5,"It's expensive for dimsum, sure, but everything was so exquisitely executed that it was worth paying extra for. I know my dimsum and I can say that it was one of the best I've had. I would definitely go back.",1
5,"I was in Soho with a friend planning to eat at Koya but we saw the queue and decided to eat elsewhere. Time Out had raved about Yauatcha, so we decided to check it out (yes shame on me, i should stay true to Yelp for recommendations). 
We stepped into a gorgeous restaurant surrounded with decadent deserts and modern chinese decor. We were promptly seated downstairs (next to the bar which also acts as a fish tank, amazing). 
Not sure what to order, we shared steamed chicken dumplings, grilled vegetable dumplings and beef ho fun noodles. The food was served quickly and was simply the best i've eaten in a while. I also had a lime and passion fruit ice tea which washed it all down nicely. All together the meal was £15 each including drinks which i think is a reasonable amount for a lunch date. It is on the more pricey side but it's really not surprising considering Yauatcha has a Michelin star, well deserved too. 
Highly recommended. I'm saving my pennies for my next round of dim sum.",1
3,"My first visit to Yauatcha was more than 7 years ago when Londoners were yet to get their fair share of upscale Chinese food.  Dim sum lunch was usually taken hastily in one of the tacky eateries in China Town and there was almost no place offering authentic Chinese cuisines and western standard service and decor. Against that backdrop, Yauatcha was an easy standout.  I was particularly impressed with the quality of the dim sum.  Coming from Hong Kong, where one can get quality dim sum aplenty, I was always skeptical of these new age chinese restaurants but Yauatcha was the rare few that delivered quality with just the right amount of innovation that justified the steeper prices it fetched.  
Times have changed though but my recent visits to Yauatcha have been disappointing.  First off, food was still of consistent quality. My favorites include the venison puff (venison in a slightly sweet puff pastry case where in the usual case it would have been bbq pork), the three style mushroom cheung fun (a steamed rice roll stuffed with mushroom) and the jasmine tea smoked rib. There is also a good selection of tea and desserts.  However, there are multiple things that were problematic. First and foremost, service was slow and inattentive, and frequently I seem to get the ""dont-seem-to-care-less"" attitude from everyone working there.  Friends have received the same treatment. Just not the kind of service you would expect at this price point.  The interiors also look a bit worn and old now, maybe time for some touchups?  If you want quality dimsum at reasonable prices, you are better off going to one of the Royal China's around town.  And if fusion is what you like, there are plenty of choices around. One good thing though is that you can always get a table at Yauatcha, if you have the cash and time to spare.",-1
4,"Had a really good night at Yauatcha.  Food was good and the wine even better!  It is pricey but as other people have mentioned, there are various deals that you could check out.  I would go back and I do recommend!",1
3,"This is a fantastic place if you are going on a date or having a business meeting but terrible if you are planning on having a meal with your family. My parents wanted to go for dim sum and I thought of trying somewhere new so a friend recommended Yauatcha after reading raving reviews about it on Yelp.
Everything about this restaurant screams modern and trendy from the design of the menu to the ambiance. Looking at the restaurant from the outside in, you would have thought it to be a cafe to enjoy a hot beverages with  a variety of desserts. Traditional would not be a word that I would use to describe this establishment. Even Debussy, Clair de Lune that was playing in the background was given an upbeat electronic remix. I didn't mind the music as I thought it was fitting to the surroundings but I really didn't like the seats. I am about 180cm tall (5'9"") and found the seats to be awkward and uncomfortable to sit in as the chairs seemed to be lower to the ground than usual. 
Anyway we order a selection of dim sum and waited for out food to arrive. The dim sum was good but not amazing especially when you factor in the price. In comparison to a typical Chinese restaurant in China town that severs dim sum, you are paying anything between £3 to £5 more. Safe to say that you are paying extra for the aesthetics appeal. It is also worth noting that you don't get free refills of the Jasmin tea. So overall I would say I prefer dining at more traditional Chinese restaurant than a modernised one hence the 3 star ranking that I gave but whenever I need to wine and dine some one then this would be one of the places that I would consider bringing them to.",-1
2,"Have had 2 visits in the last week to this highly rated restaurant. A week ago I visited with 2 friends without a reservations and we were escorted to a table behind the staircase adjacent to a register being actively used by multiple waiters. After we received our drinks we were bumped repeatedly and asked to be reseated. The manager was very gracious about moving us to a table in the larger downstairs room with a view of the huge fish tank. Dinner proceeded uneventfully and we enjoyed our meals. Tonight visited the restaurant with friends who had not been there before but this time I called to make a reservation and asked to be seated in the large room with a view of the fish tank. I was really surprised when we were seated at the exact table behind the stairs I had been given a week earlier. This time I immediately asked for another table and told them I was assured that there would be no problem sitting in the large dining room. We sat a short while and then were given another table by the kitchen but improved. 
Then came issues with the service. We received one of our appetizers. Then we received another. Then we got our three meals. We finished them and Then we received another appetizer. Then we requested the bill and then along with the bill came soup we had ordered earlier. We thought the late appetizer and soup had been forgotten. Then as we were paying my one friend said ""there is a bug in my beer""  I looked and saw a sizable live bug waving around in the beer. I wondered how many might have been in my meal. We won't go back.",-1

And brilliant.
Macaroons? Yup. And good.
Dark chocolate with roasted sesame seeds? Yes, try that. No scheisse. It's fab.
Dark chocolate cake with buddha's hand and mangosteen reduction? That too.
I hear the food is good, and the service better - looks a bit spendy, but I can never get a table.
But you can always go in and get sweets. And I'm not a sweets person.",1
5,"UH-MAZING. Crazy expensive, but fantastic ambiance, delicious food and friendly, kind and attentive waitstaff.
A+'s all around.
Order the Hakka or Lychee martini; they're both delicious. The roasted duck pumpkin puff, Jasmine tea smoked ribs and crispy aromatic duck are all delectable.
Also, just realized that once you think ""Yauatcha"" is ""Yamcha"" from DBZ, it's impossible not to see it. Possibly worth a bonus star for nostalgia.",1
5,"Although I used to enjoy the occasional business lunch at Alan Yau's earlier Hakkasan restaurant, I never felt like lingering there, nor did I ever feel like I had gotten true value from the lunch and service. Yauatcha filled that void completely. One of my favourite Dim Sum style London Chinese of the past couple of years. Whenever I'm back in town I love to pay a visit here. Like it's many teas, the food is to be savoured and enjoyed. 
Recommend the Prawn Shui mai with chicken, Shanghai soup dumplings, Crispy Duck roll, Chilli Squid and Jasmine Tea Smoke Ribs. 
For tea I recommend the Anxi Tie Guan Yin and the Silver Needle White. Take your time and enjoy their tea selection!",1
3,"Deliciously expensive dim sum, it's worth it if you are celebrating something special or on vacation here in London but definitely not somewhere you can go on a weekly basis (well if you are rich then you can). Try it once at least
Go early or make reservations as the place gets packed quick. Also, service was pretty good, it got slow once we ordered but the initial order taking was prompt, they also were very helpful in elaborating what was in certain dishes as we had some special diet restrictions during our visit.
I can't remember everything we ordered but here are few that I really liked:
Tea: White Silver Needle Tea
Food:
Chive and Prawn Dumpling
Steamed Vegetable Dumpling
King crab Shanghai siew long bun 
Hot & Sour Soup with shredded chicken
So if I enjoyed it why only 3 stars, the slow service after we initially sat down it took forever to get water, then after we finally got to order, it took forever for our drinks to come (at least 10-15 minutes).  It was an unfortunately long and exhausting meal as everything took a long wait.  It took them 20 minutes to bring the tea and all the waiter could say is that he forgot to put the order in -- that's inexcusable considering the prices you pay to eat here.",-1
3,"The atmosphere at this restaurant was probably the highlight of the experience.  you could tell a lot of thought went into the decor, which was very modern.  The service here was just okay.  Our waiter was a little bit weird about letting us hold onto the menu after we ordered.  
As for the food, it is ""fancy"" dim sum.  I didn't really feel the price premium was proportional to the improvement in taste or quality over more typical dim sum restaurants.  I ordered the spicy pork dumplings, which were not really spicy and the pork filling didn't have a lot of flavor.  The three mushroom cheung fun was probably my favorite.  The roasted duck pumpkin puff was very cute in the way it was presented, but I didn't think the combination was the best texturally inside the fried rice exterior.
All in all, I think the price premium is mostly for the atmosphere and not necessarily for better food quality.",-1
5,"Second time there. 
Venison Puffs & Taro Corquettes are my staples and they do them the best. 
It wasn't the ninja style waiting service like the first time (seriously, never saw the waiter take our empty dishes or change napkins). They gave us the Steamed Char Sui buns by mistake, but mistakes are all good when they are FREE ^___^",1
5,"GREAT time! The dining room was booked, so we ate in the bar--even more fun! Seek out bartender David for exceptional drinks and service!",1
4,"Going to Yauatcha was an exciting prospect after hearing so much about the restaurant. The experience did not disappoint. Dining at Yauatcha is an adventure. I really liked the ambience of the restaurant downstairs. There are enclaves in the walls with electric candles so the room is dark but candlelit. There is a long acquarium strip with fish brightly lit on the customer facing side of the bar. My date for the evening suggested that the noise from the music might be a problem for some diners, but it wasnt for us. In fact I enjoyed the level of noise as it gave us some privacy and also added to the ambience of the room. You can see the kitchen through frosted glass so you get a sense of how fast things are moving in the kitchen, which makes sense because the service is excellent 5/5. We ordered mushroom dim sum and prawn shui mai with chicken to begin with and these were served seamlessly right after one another. Next we were served crispy aromatic duck with pancakes and hoisin sauce. Again the service was elegant and prompt. After this we ordered egg fried rice and kung pao chicken which was excellent. The chicken was delicious and I could have eaten much more! The chilies were quite hot but not too hot to eat, apart from one. For dessert I resisted my primary urge to order the maccarons and instead ordered the chocolate pebble which was enjoyable. I could see that a lot of thought had gone into the dessert's construction and different textures as you might expect from this Michelin starred restaurant. However for me the dessert was not outstanding nor delicious. I am certainly a fan of Yauatcha and can't wait to visit again! I can see why it has earned its Michelin star as I found eating there an adventure and a delight.",1
4,"We knew that this place had pricey dim sum but we decided to give it a go anyway and yes, it's an expensive meal but the food was quite delicious. Service started off slow but got better through the evening. 
My favourite dish was the king crab dumplings (the dumpling wrap was well made - not too thick nor too chewy) and the xiao long bao was very good (although Din Tai Fung is still the best in my opinion.. gosh we wish there was a Din Tai Fung here in London!!).
The cocktails were yummy and the desserts were beautiful. Overall it was a pleasant evening.",1

1,"we come here (from Washington DC) for my husband's birthdays, since it opened...
food is wonderful ....
but we were rushed out, and we did not idle, we were eating all that time
and the waiter messed up the birthday surprise, he told my husband that the dessert is coming! when I've emailed them, and I told our waiter in person how I wanted to handle it ... all he said: ""ooops""

UPDATE:
I took my girlfriend for dinner to celebrate our arriving in London
(Date: December 18th)
worst experience ever. Waiter from Lithuania did not understand us, did not care to serve us. We were in a basement (I made a reservation for the main floor) it was literary empty, just few tables were busy, he was too busy to chit-chat with his fellow co-workers. 
One of my order was (always is) the crispy duck salad. The table next to us ordered the same their waiter mixed it well for them at their table. Not for us! I had to ask this female waitress to do it for us too, please. My cocktail came after 25 minutes sitting at empty table.
No more, never ever I will go back to this place.",-1
4,Simply delicious. Upscale dim sum restaurant. As a tourist this place was loaded with locals. Fast service and large dessert selection. I wish they had one in Los Angeles.,1
2,"I don't get it at all. This is not how I like my dim sum: unauthentic and overpriced dim sum served in a dark basement (we were downstairs) by unhappy waitstaff that know little or nothing about the food. 
The chicken feet were way too sweet and the pork ribs sour ($@%!), both of these staples of any dim sum meal. The jook (porridge) was okay, but nothing to write home about, as were the rest of the dishes, including the French macarons, which is supposedly one of the features that sets this place apart.
In sum: food bad, service bad, atmosphere not great. The only nice part of the night was the fish tank. It was pretty.
The Michelin folks need to be a lot more choosy in disbursing those stars.",-1
5,"This is hands down the best (and consistently good) dim sum in London - I cannot rave enough about it. A friend of mine introduced Yauatcha to me a few months back. Now, having tried Hakkasan I didn't really have high hopes, but it rocked my taste buds to the core.
We usually go for dim sum (lunch) and have on occasion been for dinner. Between three of us we order about 10 dishes and drinks which only comes out to about £25 each. Some may think that is extortionate for dim sum, but how many places my friend, can you get perfect venison -melt-in-you-mouth pastry puffs? None. I've seen that Royal China have tried to add them to their menu - but they just cannot compete.
Other dishes we order frequently are the pork and chive dumplings, shanghai soup dumplings and all other regulars, think pork buns, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf etc. I have to admit I come here about once or twice a month, that is how much I love it. Service used to be a lot worse but I've seen some improvement in their waiting staff. The hostesses on the other hand could be a little friendlier. 
I also like, that unlike Royal China, you can make a booking and not have to show up at 11am on a Saturday morning just to get a table. As I've said before, hands down, best dim sum in London - and coming from someone who lived in Hong Kong for 18 yrs of my life, I am serious about my dim sum.",1
2,"Really?  this place is way over hyped!  How in the world do you drop so much money on such little food.  Especially when right around the block there is better dim sum and 1/3 the price! 
I really think its just people saying look at this posh place and watch me drop my life savings down the poop shoot.  It was good but my wallet is much much thinner after the meal than before.  
I say go there if your money is buring holes in your pockets.",-1
5,"How can one resist a dimsum place with a Michelin star?  Well, you really can't.
The dimsum here is the best I've ever had.  My sister and I ordered an entire meal, then saw that our table neighbors had some yummy stuff that we didn't get, and ended up ordering another meal.
The restaurant is very hip.  The upstairs is a patisserie and tea shop.  The downstairs is dimsum.  The decor is very minimalist and modern.
Everything here is very high quality and it shows in the price - £60 for lunch for 2.  Though admittedly we did not need to eat until our tummies hurt.
Do make reservations as it is very popular.
If you've been to Hakkasan, the dimsum is just like the incredible dimsum starter there.",1
5,Excellent on every aspect - dont forget to try the macaroons,1
4,"I've been to this place a few times for dim sum. It's not bad at all. Like lots of the places you can eat round here there is nothing especially different in terms of what is being served but I have always found it good.
Some of their non-dim sum dishes are very good. I would recommend giving the place a try, if you feel like it. There's definitely nothing to fear.",1
5,"If you like upmarket Dim Sum, Yauatcha will be right up your street. It's not Chinatown as we know it but rather some kind of newly minted sparkling 21st century version of an old Chinese favorite.
We called in at 7.00 on a Sunday and we were given a table for 2. The tables are close together and as it was quietish, I requested a four-top for us as they were all empty. 
The hostess kindly seated us on a larger table after checking her table plan. 
Our waitress was excellent. I had an idea of what we wanted as I have had Dim sum before but she was great at giving us suggestions. We ended up ordering six dishes all recommended by her and I was very happy with all of them. 
The cocktail I had, called Lalu, was gorgeous and full of lime and zesty flavours. 
My favorite dim sum was the Szechaun Beef parcel and the prawn Cheung Fun. 
Our bill was a £70 for 6 dim sum, a cocktail and a beer, 2 espressos and dessert. It was all amazing and I will be back.",1
2,The food was delicious but the tight small tables and poor service were a big turn off. I won't be going back - far too many great restaurants in London.,-1
3,"I'm not sure how I feel about this place. I've grew up on dim sum and have had it in HK, Taiwan, China, LA, SF, NYC, etc. 
I went on a Sunday morning with a friend right before the afternoon rush. We got there about 12:30 and it was still pretty empty. Upon walking in, I felt disoriented. It was sleek and sexy and modern-- totally not what I expect from a yum cha place. They also have a macaroon display in the window, which I don't quite understand (since when did macaroons become asian?). 
Service: Pretty good, they tended to be above average for London standards.
Food: It's different. It's not bad. It's actually quite good. It just doesnt really look or taste much like all the other yum cha I've ever had. Pricey though-- 5 quid (at least) for a tiny dish with three siao mai in it. (But I shouldn't complain, since I wasn't paying). I have to say though, I'm pretty impressed with the tea. I can't remember which open we got, but it was light, refreshing, hot, and well prepared.
I guess it must be good since there were other Asian people there, but I still kind of like my old school yum cha/dim sum places better. The prices are really something else too. Call me a creature of habit.
That said, if someone takes you here for free, it's still definitely worth it.",-1
4,"It's a bit 'ladies who lunch'. Lots of advertising producers sharing a bottle or two and gassing about which director messed up which job and which producer copped off with which first AD. 
But frankly it's all the better for it!
Tightly packed together tables in a dark buzzy basement with low ceilings and house music oozing out of the speakers. Waiters who look like they came out of Sex And The City. It's fun, why knock it?
And the food isn't bad either. A couple of legendary dishes like the venison puffs and the tea smoked ribs. I had both again and they were as usual delicious.
We wandered in on the off chance at about 11pm on a Sat night, and although it was packed and buzzing, they were able to accommodate us in no time which I think deserves the extra star I'm giving it. 
The menu has plenty to choose from and I applaud the authenticity of much of it. (They have congee if you dare order. Yuck.) You might think it's style over substance but actually there's a lot of good food too just like their sister place Hakasaan.
I've had my battles in there like the time we over ordered and they wouldn't provide us with a doggy bag to take the rest home. Looked at me like I was mad when I made that suggestion. Certainly not something ladies who lunch often ask for. They are all skinny as a rake anyway.
But you aren't fleeced for the experience. It's the sort of place you feel will cost a fortune because of the smart surroundings but actually if you pick wisely it's not that bad. You certainly feel like you've had a run for your money when you roll out of there anyhow.
All in all, for a lively, stylish, buzzy experience in the middle of soho in cool surroundings with beautiful gossiping people, you can't really go wrong if you get a table here.",1
5,"I went to Yauatcha on Monday with a group of friends from Italy (they recommended the restaurant to ME and I've been living in London for 14 years!).
I read the reviews on Yelp and I ordered the venison puff, we all enjoyed its lovely crumbliness and sweet/savoury combo.
The waiter recommended the soft shell crab which was also delicious and accompanied with lots of chilly and sliced almonds.
The crispy duck rolls were also exceptional. The whole dim sum experience was fantastic.
Having Hayden Panettiere dining at the table next to us was also the highlight of the evening!",1
4,"I liked the place. The atmosphere, service and food were very good.
I will definitely go back there next time I am in London.",1
3,"Food was good. Service was not what you would expect from an upscale restaurant and for the prices that they charge. As for Chinese food, there are many choices with better values just a few blocks down in Chinatown.  Don't think I will go back or would recommend to my friends.",-1
5,Great place for dim sum that is extraordinarily good and for that quality it is actually very good value. I would focus on the dim sum. I come here regularly and the place never lets you down.,1
4,"A wide variety of delicious food, creative drink menu in a cool, well decorated interior.",1
5,"When this place first opened-up, I wasn't sure exactly what it was! All you see outside are blue, blue walls. So one day, we decided to venture inside!
The amount of dim sum on offer is stupid! There is such a gorgeous, varied selection, it's unreal and each little piece tastes like heaven.
The amount of speciality / herbal teas they have here is also really great. We aren't made of money so couldn't afford the ones we *really* wanted but the Champagne Green Tea is one I definitely want to go back for and try out!
What a great dim sum place, I really couldn't ask for more at a restaurant like this. It's awesome!",1
4,"I've been here twice, once for a nice lunch - and last week for dinner. The latter definitely suited the place, which is dark, seductive and framed by blue neon lights.
Yautcha does tea well (on street level), complete with great cakes, but this place comes alive at night. Each time I've been there, I've sat downstairs, where the tables are packed in, but it still doesn't seem crowded or uncomfortable.
The best food on the menu is the dim sum (the steamed mushroom dumplings are to die for, and I love the venison puffs), though there are larger Asian dishes and curries if you fancy something more hearty. Make sure you have a dessert as well. I had a ginger and white chocolate cheesecake that knocked me for six for a while as I floated away in a pudding-induced daydream.
The waiters do a fantastic job of recommending dishes if you're unsure (the first lunch I had here, one of the guys just brought us a selection of their best dishes and man, it was good).
Not exactly cheap (I could probably get just-as-good dim sum at Ping Pong - which I prefer as a destination), you're paying again for the place itself. The swanky designer decor, the attentive service and the oh-so-hip atmosphere. That said, I think it's worth it as the food is yummy and it's the sort of place you feel happy having a long conversation-fuelled dinner in and not being rushed.
I'll definitely be going back, if anything just to try the cocktails (the list looked intriguing, but my dinner guests weren't drinking). Next time gadget.",1
4,"A great way of getting some of Alan Yau's quality food without the Hakkasan heart attack inducing prices. Most people talk about the ""funkier"" items like the venison puffs but I actually enjoy the more traditional items like the rice noodles and Singaporean chili crab which are tasty and (shockingly!) pretty authentic. 
Recommend sharing a pot of tea which runs least almost 10 pounds the last time I checked. Close out with the matcha macarons.",1
4,"The food here is really pretty good. We opted for prix fixe option in the back of the menu and were not disappointed in quality or quantity. It loses a star for being overly loud and crowded--they need to lose about 20% of their tables to make this a more enjoyable dining experience. We were practically on top of the tables either side of us, and privy to every aspect of their conversations.",1
4,"They have two floors of modern dining space, a nice selection of vegetarian dim sum. teas, and cocktails.  The service was very attentive.  They were kind enough to warn me up front, and without asking that the chili oil was not vegetarian since it contained fish sauce.  If you've eaten at Yank Sing in SF, you will find this Yauatcha to be of similar quality with a better beverage selection and modern decor.  Definitely worth another visit.",1
5,"Great food, great service! amazing dim sum. I myself had not tried dim sum prior to yauatcha. but ive tried quite a bit after that and this place sits right on the top. the vegetable and chicken dim sum is to die for! 
apart from that, they've got the most amazing vegetable fried rice and desserts too!
should definitely try this place out!",1
5,"This is my favourite place to go for Dim Sum and they serve it all day long!  The tab comes out to be bit on the pricier side, but the selection, quantity, quality and overall attentiveness of the staff makes Yautcha number one on my list!",1
4,"I was intending to visit this place for the umpteenth time again the other week for tea and cakes possibly followed by a cocktail when I realised the amazing cake counter had disappeared.
Anyone know where it's gone? Will it be returning?
I don't think I'll visit again if they don't have the macaroon platter still :(",1
4,"The dim sum here are in a league of their own, as are the cocktails. Creative alchemy seems to be in full force with the imaginative infusions and hybrids of flavours dreamed up and merged together with those cocktails. They are expensive but they are so worth it.
 I am yet to sample the cakes, but I plan to when I can afford to go!",1
3,"Brother-in-law mentioned this place has a Michelin star, so why not? Decor and atmosphere was on the too painfully hip side of things, especially in the loungy downstairs room where we were seated. Low tables and low padded chairs felt a bit like sitting at the kiddy table. Otherwise, I suppose you are getting your money's worth, as the tab will reflect the quality of the surroundings ;)
The large menu of overly flowery, fruity, asian-themed cocktails seemed to highlight their mixologists' importance, but didn't interest me much, especially at 9 quid a drink, but what do I know, the young gals at the other tables were having quite a few.
Well, the eats - dim sum and other Chinese dishes were executed quite well, with authentic, distinct and varied flavors. A number of interesting and unique variations on dim sum were pretty good, especially fried and pastry items, like duck pumpkin puff. Haute dim sum, I suppose. Didn't have dessert, but after reading other reviews, glad I didn't, as it seemed they used to do much better sweets. On the way out spied some plated asian BBQ short ribs in the kitchen that looked tasty, we missed out perhaps?
Almost 4 stars, but quite average service and the steep prices keep me from getting all the way there. Plus, I was getting such a pre-recession posh vibe from this joint, for dim sum and Chinese food, of all things, but maybe that's just me.",-1
4,"Yoatcha is a plush place to have a meal. Booking a table is advisable as both floors are packed, though if you go for lunch, it will still be busy but you will get a table.  My first visit a few years back, I booked a table and still ended up sitting on a large round table with a few other couples, which was fine, but I did want my own table, especially as I booked.
The décor is modern with massive fish tanks and black marble floors. The service is typically first class by the Japanese and the food is exquisite, on my last visit I had venison puffs, which were great, Ostridge dumplings, great! I didn't like the whole fish I ordered, which was haddock, at £30! The spicey squid and rice sticks were delish. They have a great dim sum too. Everything is expensive but you will definitely attentively waited and the food will be great. 
One downside is that on my last visit, me and two friends booked a table, but we still had to wait 20 minutes or so, they gave us the menus so we could get ahead of the game, and I didn't really like that, they really are so busy. 
On leaving the restaurant, you can buy some goodies or teas and herbs to take home, the shop is right next to the exit as if it were a museum, but they do have some nice deserts to take home.",1
5,"This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in London... It's walking distance from the Soho Hotel which is a plus for me as well. The dim sum here is very good but my favorite dish here has to be the duck egg rolls. 
It is not traditional Dim Sum, which is one of the reasons I think I find myself craving it when I'm back home. This is a must eat before I leave restaurant for me every time.",1
1,"Overall left very unimpressed by Yauatcha. Walked in around 6pm on a rainy Sunday evening and were seated only after some fuss and the promise to leave within an hour and a half despite many empty seats available.
Next, ordered two appetizers, but the waiter (who didn't seem to understand English well enough to not mess things up) brough three - one of which we had not ordered. He didn't apologize or offer to take it back. All three appetizers were underwhelming: chicken steamed shu mai, pork buns and something else we had not ordered. Greasy and not particularly great flavors.
We then ordered fried rice with long beans, which for ten pounds I expected would be delicious, but was greasy and tasteless. Beef in black bean sauce - greasy and chewy. 
We took a couple of bites but didn't want anymore of it so asked if it could be packed to take away. They said no- they don't pack food to take away.
Overall a very very underwhelming, over priced experience with cold staff. Would not return.",-1
4,"About a year ago I was at Yauatcha with some friends, and someone got to wondering whether Yauatcha had ever had a Michelin star.  There was some disagreement (some thought it still had a star), so we eventually asked a waiter who, after leaving to consult colleagues, eventually returned with the news that at that moment, Yauatcha was still the holder of one star, but that it was uncertain whether this situation would continue for much longer!  Evidently the fate of the restaurant did not rest with that curiously pessimistic member of staff, for the 2010 list is now out, and Yauatcha still has its star.
I revisited a few days ago, and whilst Yauatcha is perhaps not the restaurant is once was, it's still got some pretty good moves.  The dim sum is some of the best in London, and whilst not cheap, it can be surprisingly good value: it's very much possible to drink tea and eat well for £25, which is perhaps £10 more than an acceptable dim sum you might get somewhere else.  (I've only ever eaten dim sum at Yauatcha; other dishes will be more expensive.)
The food is recognisably traditional, though with a few twists--venison might replace beef, for example.  The presentation is pretty good, even for menu items that sound uninspiring.  Dim sum is not for the truly timid, but although chicken feet are on the menu, there's plenty of safe dumplings and ribs and buns, etc. to be had.  The mushroom cheung fun (mushroom wrapped in a loose noodle sheath) is close to twice the price of the meat and seafood variations, but well worth it.  The deep fried squid was also excellent.
The decor is nice and staff are pleasant.  Neither is intimidating.  It can be noisy, and isn't suited for long, lingering meals.  As other reviews have mentioned, the dramatic cake display upstairs has disappeared--a loss.
Four stars--I'm a fan, and I'll be back.",1
4,"Make reservations and try this place at least once if you like Dim Sum. A good friend of mine recommended this place and we tried it at the beginning of the New Year.  I didn't think to make reservations but luckily my wife and I was seated strait away. Get ready it is expensive here but the service is wonderful and the food is brilliant (it was 50pounds for the 2 of us). This is quite possibly the best Dim Sum in all of London. My favorite is the very popular pumpkin puff, venison puff, and the jasmine ribs. The environment has a modern design but comes with classy service.   
         The reason I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 is I didn't have a chance to try dessert. And this would be a splendid restaurant to bring a date but it is in Soho.",1
4,"although the portions are quite small and its a little over priced, the food is here is nothing less than delicious! didnt get a chance to try dessert, although it looked yummy, so i will return for that in the very near future!",1
5,"In addition to the dim sum restaurant downstairs, I would also highly recommend coming here for the ground floor tea room.  
There is a big selection of teas to chose from, hot and cold ones and the cakes are divine and colourful.  You might even hesitate before eating them, but the taste is not disappointing.  My sister brought me here for some tea and catch up, and I was pleasantly impressed.  It is a bit pricey, but a great location for a treat.",1
3,"It's good but don't expect traditional dishes. Creates a big hole in the wallet, not somewhere I will think of straightaway when i want some dim sum.

5,"Last time i visite London, i wants to eat sth. from asia.
So i go to this restaurant and it was amazing.
It was tasty and delicious.",1
5,Very good across the board. Michelin-rated Chinese restaurants are pretty hard to come by in the US so this was a treat to be in the UK and stumble on this gem. I will also say the best meal we had in London. Hibiscus was good but Yautcha was better.,1
5,"Pricey, above mid-range. Quality dimsum. If you're on a budget, just try their dimsum.",1
4,"I would give it a five, but because the dessert section disappeared, I'll only give it a 4. The desserts were just too damn good! :) I remember a passion fruit soupy/ice-creamery dessert that was heavenly yummy!
Anyway - the dimsum are fantastic. Quite surprising for a posh place like this. I am used to eating dimsum in shabby, dark chinese places ;) But here you have the glitter and the taste all at once. A must-visit if you are around.
If you can, choose to sit downstairs. With the aquarium bar, and the soft lights, it's really cosy. Good place for a date actually :)",1
4,"Really enjoyed our recent visit for pre-theater dining.  Very exotic decor, but oddly soothing.  Waitstaff was not overly friendly, but informative and very efficient.  One of our party had a shellfish allergy and they were really on guard after hearing this news.  ""Shrimp!  Don't eat that!  Eat this!"" ""This has only sweet potato -- you can eat this!"", accompanied by lots of vehement hand gestures.  Only quibbel -- we asked for 4 macaroons and they didn't offer us any choices.  We assumed (incorrectly) that choice was not an option.  We got 3 weird ones:  violet, popcorn and bubblegum (I would not have chosen any of these, voluntarily) and one normal one: tiramisu (yum!) So, definitely specify.",1
4,"This place is ""contemporary dim sum."" I said contemporary because the servers do not push the carts around and the decor and prices are ""modern/pretentious."" The dim sum has a refined quality though and taste is excellent. There are also unique cocktails and beautifully crafted desserts that taste scrumptious. However, I heard that the portions got smaller since I have been there.",1
5,"this place will blow your mind in two ways.
1.)  it's hands down the most amazing dim sum i've ever had in my 29 years anywhere - asia, the americas, europe... this is the best.  
2.)  the prices are RIDICULOUSLY expensive.
does #1 outweigh #2?  yes.  absolutely.  you have to go here at least once.  i don't know how they make the food so good-  superior ingredients is my guess, because if you're talking components it tastes exactly the same as other dim sum places but if you're talking quality there is no comparison - everything from the beef to the sesame oil has its own distinctive freshness and jumps out at you.  i have never had an experience where so many ingredients tasted so distinctively delicious at various times within the same bite (no i wasn't exceptionally hungry, drunk, high, or otherwise unduly influenced).  
but to temper your enthusiasm here are the prices for several of the items we ordered (keep in mind this is dim sum and thus the sizes are accordingly tiny):
*USD / GBP was about $1.62/GBP 1
:: 4 jasmine tea smoked ribs - GBP 10.80, $17.53
:: rocket (arugula) spring salad - GBP 18, $29.16
:: 3 xiao long bao - GBP 3.50, $5.67
:: 3 pork dumplings with chives and tiny dried shrimp - GBP 5.50, $8.91
:: peking duck (not the standard peking duck - it was deep fried dark meat only and it came shredded) - GBP 28, $45.36
:: beef flat noodle - GBP 11.50, $18.63
this is a must-go if you can afford it.",1
5,Exceptional place! The food is amazing and it would be a shame if I didn't mention the guys' effort. The management have obviously done an excellent job  everyone in there knows they're doing and do it with passion and a smile.,1
5,"I have eaten at better restaurants, I have eaten better dim sum, I have had better service. But somehow this restaurant still gets 5 stars because I always come out feeling like I've had the loveliest treat ever. The quality of the teas (and tea cocktails), the beauty of the dim sum, the ritual of it all, and the fish and flowers.
 Yauatcha is a hybrid of a swanky dim sum restaurant and a very posh tea house. Although it's possible to eat dim sum upstairs, the restaurant is technically downstairs, and tea and cake upstairs. The two are very different in character; upstairs is light and airy and downstairs is dark and sexy.
 When you book to eat, you can choose upstairs or downstairs. Evening meals go downstairs, light snacks, afternoon tea, upstairs. You cannot choose the exact spot when you book, however I recommend once you get there that you specify you would like to sit in the main section downstairs, not around the side. In fact you should insist upon this, and prepare to wait a bit longer. Although this may be a hassle, you will enjoy it far more, I promise.
 As a reasonably critical person who has visited Yauatcha countless times over the last six years, which is akin to giving the place spot checks throughout its history, I can say one thing: Yauatcha is consistent. As such it's a great place to entertain friends, treat clients, or take one's partner.
 The style of decor, food, and service treads that fine line between being suitable for business and for romance. One can equally bring one's glamorous Persian girlfriend here late on a Friday night, and one's aging mother for a Sunday afternoon tea. (Currently one has the latter, not the former...)
 You may find the front of house snooty. Personally I love it. I don't want to be greeted and subsequently ignored by anyone other than the impossibly (I'm not allowed to say ""pathologically"" am I? No) slim, beautiful girls who do it so brilliantly. I like my FOH efficient, with that edge of slight disdain that says ""you do realise where you are, don't you?""
 The dim sum is inventive and seasonal, the ingredients are fresh. The menu has naturally changed over the last few years but the favourites still exist to this day; the Baked Venison Puff is a must, although the venison is a little more stodgy than it used to be but the pastry has got even better. Sadly the shark fin soup appears to be off the menu - it's probably best though, isn't it? Oh and I love the latest (Autumn 2010?) addition of the Crystal Dumplings - lovely little translucent steamed things stuffed with pumpkin and pine nut. The Lotus Leaf Rice is another simple, well-executed crowd-pleaser. Mooli puffs are fun little creatures to behold, they are vegetable dumplings with a pastry exterior rolled into the exact shape (and presumably dyed to the same colour) as a little carrot, with some spinach coming out the top. This is high-end-pastry-chef-meets-Roger-Rabbit and I heartily approve.
 It's a terrible shame their cake counter has been replaced. Yauatcha staff say this is because the cake chef left in Autumn 2009. Oh, the gold-flecked chocolate ganaches - I mourn their passing. (I'm not serious. Actually no yes I am.) Nevertheless the macaroons are still great.
 The downstairs decor is stunning. You know how some people, when they walk out of the house, they put on a suit and look smart, at all times? Even if they put on a bit of a shabby jacket, they still look ridiculously hot? The interior decor of Yauatcha is that person. It could never become a bit tatty, because it's so hot in the first place. The tropical fish and the flower displays are very special indeed. Music is ambient and always at the perfect level for conversation, and the restaurant's acoustic allows it to become quite lively when busy, but never too loud. It has a lovely bustly feel, but I never get offended by loud groups here. (I usually hate loud groups.)
 I personally love to enjoy food at Yauatcha on a Sunday afternoon, post-lunch, when the service is relaxed and the downstairs restaurant is quiet.
 I'm sure it's possible to bring children, but really it's not that kind of place - in case you hadn't guessed. Personally I find it nice to get away from restaurants (especially Sunday afternoons!) that are brimming with prams and cots and toys and screams.
 Oh, and the bill? It's not pricey especially compared to a number of notably inferior chain dim sum restaurants I could name (some are very nearby...)
 It caters for all appetites and tastes in food. You simply can't go wrong. Go!",1
1,"If the food was as good as the staff is inattentive and pretentious, then the food would be extraordinary. 
Alas, the food tastes very, very average. 
Combined with high prices, it is not a place I would recommend. I will NOT go back.",-1
5,"Went for a quick bite at 18.30. Place was half empty but reception still checked their bookings, which always makes me smile. I suppose they do need to check that they might have forgotten that 100 people were arriving en mass.
However she was charming and it was all smiles to our table. Been four times here and never been disappointed, food is great. My favourite is the Green Tea Smoked Ribs, but we always try new things. Not China Town prices, but as you would expect from an Alan Yau venture, the quality is several steps up. A real treat.",1
4,"Yauatcha isn't located in the most salubrious part of London - it's in the heart of Soho and right next door to the Berwick Street market.
It has 2 distinct personalities. The most obvious one is a sophisticated tea house, serving the most elegant and amazing cakes and macaroons, which you can see from the big windows opening onto the street. They just look so perfect and colourful and full of flavour. These are served on the ground floor and many people come for takeaway.
The other part to Yauatcha is a high-class (and expensive!) dim sum restaurant on the ground floor. Routine dishes are given a lift with exotic ingredients like venison and even gold leaf. Lovely to eat. Expensive ingredients make it better? Debatable I think.
So a solid 4 stars - lovely experience but heavy on the wallet.",1
4,I tried their pineapple desserts and it was exactly what I expected. It wasn't too sweet and it was just the way I like it,1
5,"Simply excellent. Extremely knowledgable and professional wait staff, incredible food and great atmosphere and decor.",1
3,"So I went to London and was offered a free place to stay by my friends who were working there. Everything in London is expensive. They say Tokyo is worse, but definitely not when I was there. Every time I bought anything it was like I was getting hit by a football in the groin. Even McDonald's was expensive. Now the exchange rate is much better at least.
Apart for the UK pricing, this was a really good restaurant. All the food we had was excellent, and they made some interesting cocktails as well. I definitely liked all the fish tanks. All the decor was well done. We had made reservations so there was no wait. There were some people waiting though who had not.
After all was said and done it came out to be about $80 a person. Of course my friend I was traveling with and I paid for the two friends who we were staying with so it became a cinder block to the groin night, and not in a good way.",-1
3,"This one Michelin starred restaurant assured me that one star can be bought. Food is ok but definitely not Michelin star calibre. Ambiance is cool and chic. Service is horrible. I had been here twice, once for lunch and another for dinner.
For lunch, I ordered some tea and they ran out of the tea leaves then decided to serve hot water without any explanation AND charge me the price of tea. When I complained, the manager came over and told me I will get a small dish for free.  Never a proper explanation nor APOLOGY. 
For dinner, six of my friends and I booked for dinner on Saturday, ordered over £1,000 worth of food and drinks, and this manager lady approached me and told we must leave before our two hour time allowance ends.  Never informed of such a ridiculous policy when I made the booking and this is unheard of in Michelin star restaurant to chase out diners. 
Venison puff is what's recommended, it was ok bit salty for my taste.
Har gau was good
Any spicy Sichuan dish is not recommended as this isn't the right place to have it. Just go for dim sums, if you must visit this restaurant.
Quite obviously, I will never go back to this place.",-1
3,"Dim was okay.  Could get the same quality Dim Sum in Chinatown for way cheaper!  
Service was poor.  Waitress wasn't really friendly.  When asked about the menu and where certain things were on the menu she would just give you this blank stare like you should know.  What a dumb ass! and she wonders why she didn't get a tip.  Maybe if your service was better and you smiled a little more you would get better tip. -_-
Macaroons were pretty good.  I only recommend macaroons they were decent and not overpriced.  
Come here if you don't mind paying for overpriced Dim Sum.",-1

 Sometimes, when one needs comfort food on a lazy Sunday afternoon, only dim sum will do. And as if to prove that comfort and style need not be mutually exclusive, there's Yauatcha. (There's also my new Massimo Dutti heels, the mildly glam-in-an-officey-way exterior of which belies a sensible, I'm-on-the-wrong-side-of-30, cushioned inner sole. But I digress.)
 Yauatcha is a modern dim sum tea house with a refined air and a Michelin Star held firmly between its chopsticks. Formerly owned by Alan Yau, it proves to be surprisingly good value (say, around £25 per head) - particularly if you stick to dim sum and tea. Although I caution that the bill does start to stack up if you opt for larger dishes and wine.
 The ground level, where we enjoy our lunch time dim sum, feels bright and fresh, with shades of blue and a large fish tank lining the entrance. Downstairs, is more dimly lit and clandestine - a popular option for the evening crowd.
 We start with some roasted blue tea, the Fuijan Wuyi Yan, Shui Xian (£4 per pot), which we chose on the basis that other options are more expensive and our waiter tells us they all taste fairly similar. It's rather bland, and doesn't really improve with the food. Choose another one.
 Dim sum comes in sets of 3 (reflecting the number's association with good luck and the word ""alive"" in Chinese superstition, but often resulting in heavy negotations for me and the TPG.)
 The beautifully presented scallop shui mai (£7.50) is a treasure-like bundle of juicy scallops and prawns topped with gleaming jewels of roe. The winter melon dumplings look like pudgy carrots, but are an enjoyable taste of Thai winter melon, black fungus, straw mushroom and gong choi (£3.80).
 The sticky rice in lotus leaf with chicken and shrimp (£4.80) is good (but not the greatest) but then the char sui bun (3 for £3.50) is fantastic (a must) - and also great value compared to the lesser morsels you might get for around the same price in Chinatown.
 We steer off the dim sum menu to try the Szechuan seafood claypot (£17.00) - a fresh and colourful mix of prawns, (slightly too chewy) squid, peanuts, mushrooms, snowpeas, baby corn and chilli. TPG was more of a fan than I, but possibly because I think this a dim sum haven for me and I'm reluctant to diverge to the larger dishes unless it's for something extraordinary.
 Our warm vanilla rice pudding with banana sorbet and caramelised pineapple (£7.50) is absolutely gorgeous, even if the pineapple was a little hard to negotiate. Handmade chocolates and macaroons are also on display - I tried a selection of 4 chocolates for £3 which were reasonably nice but no match for the pudding.
 One possible hitch to any long, lazy, Sunday afternoon plans you might be hatching is that we were warned our table had to be returned after 2 hours - although no-one policed that once we sat down. We paid around £30 per head for our meal.
 Yauatcha comes with my seal of approval for dim sum with a touch of glamour on the side. I was so impressed, that I've already booked us into Yauatcha's big brother, Hakkasan, next month.
 My only regrets are that we missed the bulging, glistening har gua dumplings and the blue swimmer crab salad with sesame dressing, both of which we had to suffer through others enjoying on the next table. As if we need another excuse to go back.",1
4,"For a world class city, London has some pretty dreadful dim sum venues. Fortunately Yauatcha is one of the good ones. Yes, you end up paying a lot more for the food than you would at some of the other places in London (and certainly more than you would at most places in Hong Kong, San Francisco, Vancouver). Yes, you pay for some of the attitude and decor. Yes, the chairs are pretty uncomfortable.
In the end, it's all about the food and you have to admit that some of the dishes are pretty darn good. The har gau are excellent with clear skins and the right amount of bite. The venison puff (cha siu so) are excellent versions with a nice hint of black pepper and a fantastic flaky crust. I especially like the shrimp and beancurd cheung fun; it's their version of  zha leung but instead of a chinese donut inside, they use a shrimp and beancurd skin roll. Fantastic. Save room for the black sesame dumplings. Some of the best I've ever had anywhere with a truly handmade taste and texture.
I agree that some of their dishes (especially the non-dim sum mains) are overpriced. If you can avoid those, you can have an excellent dim sum deal for not much more than you would spend in London Chinatown.
My biggest pet peeve is that they only make one pot with each order of tea leaves. Some of the teas, especially the oolongs, actually taste better with the second brewing!",1
2,"Despite problems with the reception staff, not the waiters, the biggest issue here was that the food was distinctly average. We went for the £40 Dim Sum Special for 3 people, and every plate was no better than average. Crab salad fine, but watery crab, dim sum dry and not flavourful. The crispy duck was crispy only because it was overcooked, and its pancakes too sticky and thick. It's a lovely room, but I was amazed to read afterwards that it has a Michelin star. Taipan in Milton Keynes is a far better dining experience.",-1
5,"bit on expensive side, service can be slow at times when busy, but food is delish! Been a few times already. Can't think of one dish we didnt like and coctails are amazing",1
5,"My favorite restaurant in London!! Yauatcha tends to draw mixed reactions from people, but the great majority agree: Yauatcha rocks!!
My absolute favorite dishes are the Shark's fin Hot & Sour Soup (just the thought of it makes my glands flow), the Shitake & Duck Roll, the Spinach Cube (stunning. stunning.), and the hand pulled noodles with shimeji mushrooms. Give me three of each of these and I'm happy and stuffed.
Bear in mind, this is not a traditional dim sum or high street chinese restaurant. The dishes are, for the most part, variations of the oldies. A lot of the dim-sum dishes would be familiar to you, but this is a menu worth taking time over and trying as many of those that appeal to you. Chances are you won't be disappointed with the flavors of the dishes. The ingredients are obviously of the highest quality and kitchen consistently produces the same high standard every time we've been there. 
Added to which the restaurant (downstairs) has a very smooth decor; subtle, warm and inviting. The bathrooms are pretty slick too...
Be sure to try the delicious teas (white tea... mmm-MMM!).",1
4,"You get a 45 minute booking at this place to scoff your grub and sod off.
Fantastic food though.",1
4,"In short: Delicious food, great interior, kind of slow service. But still nice staff. I passed by this place so many times, but never actually went in. On a Sunday evening I decided to change that. This is a modern and nicely styled restaurant. Part of the bar is an aquarium, seating is relatively low, it's just a bit different from most other restaurants. That makes it interesting. And the food was really good. I just realized that it even has a Michelin Star.",1
4,"SETTING
Trendy but muted restaurant in Soho.
FOOD
Dim sum fare, absent the trollies. Sampled baked venison puff, Jasmine tea smoked ribs, Peking duck spring rolls, crab and caviar soup, hand pulled noodle with Shimeji mushrooms. Fresh ingredients, fine craftsmanship, and delicate flavors.
Dessert was spectacular. Had the ""Victoria"", Glazed donut with chocolate mousse and blackberry compote filling, and ""Tendance Cannelle"" a half dome of chocolate mousse enrobed in caramel with a cinnamon crème brulee center. Colorfully tempting selection of macaroons also available. 
SERVICE
Gracious. Lovely waitresses in stylish, white uniforms with decorative straps (of unclear function) strung around the derrieres.
WILL I BE BACK?
Pricey. Dessert worth a return visit.",1
5,"Wow. Wow. Wow. 
Located in the Soho district of London you will find Yauatcha, another one of Alan Yau's masterpiece restaurants. One of my mates who resides in London was nice enough to intro me to the restaurant by meeting me there for lunch, it was no doubt THE best dim sum restaurant I have EVER been to in my life, thanks Si. The décor of this restaurant was simply stunning, so much so that I can not even do it justice explaining it here, I'll have to leave it at that, seriously. 
I started with a bowl of Hot & Sour soup with shredded chicken for $6.50 quid. It was truly what I expected, a smooth sweet medley of flavours with a slight hint of tartness (doubt that's a word), one of the finer soups I've tried. They also had shark fin soup which immediately put a foul taste in my mouth althought I didn't even order it, I HATE everything about shark fin soup and that is a completely different discussion. I am glad to know that Alan Yau has removed his 40 pound shark fin soup dish from his world famous restaurant Hakkesan. 
Next from the menu I tried the Pork & Prawn Shumai. It was delectably different from the traditional Pork Shumai that I am used to in the GTA. The texture of this particular dumpling was just perfect with the right amount of meat. It didn't blow me out of the water, but it was damn good. 
Next I had a dish which re-shaped my discerning palette for good. It was a baked venison puff, the best dim sum item that has ever graced my mouth. The texture of this puff was perfectly flaky, the filling was of a richer darker meat, and the sweet taste was so good I thought I was dreaming. The puffs came x 3, but I could have done x 25.  
Aside from Yauatcha there is also Alan Yau's Hakkesan which I briefly mentioned above. Hakkesan is considered by many to be one of the best restaurants in the world, and I am somewhat disappointed that I was not able to hit it up while I was in London. However, I really can't picture the quality of food and décor being all that much better than Yauatcha, at most I can see it being on par which says a lot! I just wanted to mention Hakkesan because if you are in London I would highly recommend both of these restaurants if you are a Dim Sum enthusiast. I will warn you the prices are very high averaging at least $6-7 quid per dish, a big change for me because the dishes here in the GTA run for $3-4 CAD, but more than worth it. 
Only after I came back from my visit to London did I come to learn that Yauatcha had gained 2 Michelin starts since its inception in 2004. If you don't live in the UK, book your vacation now.",1
1,"BE WARNED! THE WAIT STAFF WILL POCKET YOUR CHANGE!!!!!
Normally I would have given them a much higher rating but the service CLEARLY was soo bad I have to give them this low rating.
I had ordered the 2-person taste of Yua-Atcha- which was exceptional. HOWEVER the staff was quite rude about stating their policies(they ""never"" allowed take-away - not true) But the main sore point was the fact when the bill came, I paid in cash over the amount(did not have exact change) - now the gratuity of 12.5% had ALREADY been added to the bill's total amount. I waited and waited until finally asked where my change was - she looked confused and walked away. I then asked the manager for the receipt to check the amount I gave them, again he said NOTHING about returning my change. - NOTE TO ALL - BE VERY WARY - I think that they feel that they ""deserved the extra tips....I definitely will NOT be returning to their establishment!",-1
4,Very good steamed dim sum although I was not a fan of the fried or the puffs. Too much pastry for my liking. Trendy restaurant though with fish tanks everywhere. Nice setting and definitely good value for money. I will be back.,1
5,"Pants-wettingly expensive dainty plates of cute, asian perfection. With macaroons.
 Yauatcha is deserving of all its credentials, and is an oasis of calm cleanliness in a particularly filthy bit of Soho. It's mind bogglingly expensive though, with no real set menu, so you can really rack up the bill if you're not paying attention.
 I have been in to pick up macaroons, since they're nigh-on perfect for London. Go for lunch if you can persuade someone richer to pay for it, otherwise just go for tea and cake. It's lovely.",1
4,"ME: "" Hello Yauatcha I'd like to review your restaurant. ""
YAUATCHA:  "" Ok, we can fit your review in a week next Tuesday at 8.35 pm until 10.05 pm ""
------- ---------- ---------- --------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- ------- 
So you got the booking? Congratulations. A few years ago that was one of the toughest things to do here in London. The night-time 25thCentury Dim Sum bar with it's aquarium-filled cocktail bar and 1 Michelin Star was the talk of the town. The Dim Sum craze began here with Yau's creativity, coolness and excellent design.
It helped that they had edible GOLD-painted dumplings too!
Those bling-bling dumplings have sadly left the menu but plenty of other extravangances exist and the prices can rocket sky high for some small dishes. And if you are trying the world-class teas and masterpiece petit fours upstairs then you could be forgiven for thinking they screwed up and just converted prices one-to-one from Chinese Yuan they are so high.
But don't let that fool you. Yauatcha is the cheapest place I've ever had a filling Michelin-starred meal. If you come in a three (3 is the magic Dim Sum number) then you can stuff yourself with many dishes and even have cocktails and quite easily leave without spending more than 30 each. That's pretty magical considering you'll not eat at many places so obviously cool and 25th Century.
It's sounding like the perfect date place too, isn't it?
Well it almost is... but think of all those awkward moments when little dumpling number 3 is lying there and you have to decide who gets it. Take my advice and do your dating mid-afternoon with the tea and cakes upstairs. Yau's Taiwanese tea-expert wife is the lord of this section and this lady gets it right - easily the best Asian teas in town.
So why is my once favourite restaurant in the world only getting four stars? Because of the system... the booking, the time allocation and the..

4,"Yauatcha is the place to go for meticulously made morsels of dim sum gorgeousness. I'm not experienced enough with dim sum - although I've enjoyed my fair share - to know just how experimental or creative it can be without departing from its essence or origins. But Yauatcha appears to both retain the familiar core of dim sum and push the boundaries of taste and presentation.
 At Yauatcha you could dine out on presentation alone: they take visual beauty very seriously. Each element is artfully combined to play colour against texture against size and shape.
 But most memorably, the clever an unusual combinations of basic ingredients (pork, prawns, scallops, soft-shelled crab, for example) with subtle spices and seasonings, encased in truly world-class pastry, amount to a sparkling dim sum fantasia beyond reasonable expectation.
 The highlight of the afternoon was quite possibly a lovely, moist, spongy, buttery pastry sprinkled with sesame seeds with a venison (yes, venison) stuffing that just oozed with sinful suggestiveness.
 Jade dumplings, so-called because of their green hue, stuffed with wild mushrooms were another inspired marvel.
 The tea menu is equally staggering in its breadth - we practically got high on so many delicate, aromatic teas.
 And all of this happens under the watchful eye of slightly dopey goldfish and miniature carp in a long fishtank.
 Service is somewhat erratic and indifferent, but when the dim sum starts flowing, coming at you in waves of colour, you are past caring.
 This is a damn fine restaurant.",1
4,"This place is a fantastic  dim sum style Chinese restaurant and tea-room. It is pretty funky and trendy in here which means it is on the more expensive side but the food is certainly worth it.
I have visited a couple of times now for special occasions, and the place is perfect for cosy dates! I would request to be seated downstairs in the main room if you are looking for a bit of atmosphere as they have a beautiful sky effect with gorgeous lighting.
There is also a fabulous range of oriental inspired cocktails but they tend not to taste very alcoholic (even though they most certainly are!) so it is worth keeping an eye on how many you order! Upstairs there is also a patisserie which is lovely to visit for tea. I would definitely recommend booking in advance as the place can get very busy.",1
5,"When you go there you have to try ""barbecue spare ribs"" 
Little bit over the budget but you'll try one of the best restaurants in Central London. Definitely worthy to visit.",1
3,"This place has a Michelin star?  Ha thats freakin funny.  I wonder if people really understand Chinese food.  I've had a lot of Chinese food in some of the most heavily populated immigrant communities and across several continents.  This is not even the best Chinese food I've had in UK.  The food isn't bad but worthy of Michelin star.  Pretty funny is you ask me.  This place is gorgeous and the layout is absolutely gorgeous as far as restaurants go, especially for Chinese.  The macaroon display at the front is beautiful but I didn't especially like them, a bit too sweet for my liking.  The other reaon why I think I didn't enjoy the meal as much was the price tag for dim sum.  It was on the corporate card so I shouldn't care but it's the principle damnit.  
Food was good with a bunch of hit and misses among the bunch.  The har gow was nice, well made, good texture to the wrapper.  Har gow was ok.  Some of the other shrimp dumplings we had were also very nice.  I also enjoyed the duck rolls.  There were definitely some low points with the noodle and meat dishes.  Did any of the people who reviewed the restaurant actually review based on food or the fact that this place is Michelin rated or that the space is stunning?  Come on people let's do better.  This is not a 5 star restaurant, maybe 4 if you order smartly and get their good dishes.",-1
5,"This is by far the best dim sum I've had in London.  It does not come cheap, for sure, but it's one of the restaurants that lives up to the hype.  Everything I tried was fantastic.  The only place where I saw a bit of room for improvement is in the fruity cocktails, which tasted a bit art artificial.  But overall, great stuff and I look forward to going back.",1
5,This was an amazing dining experience!! and some of the best food i've ever eaten!! try a venison puff if you wanna know what I'm talking about! Or a duck pumpkin ball! This is exceptional food. Try it!!! wow!!!,1

My second experience was for lunch with girlfriends.  Three hours later, 12 dishes ordered and 2 desserts -- we called it a successful outing.  Their cakes are beautifully made and as tasty as they look.  I recommend the violeta (sp?).",1
5,Fantastic fusion.  Great take on traditional Chinese food.  Makes me want to move to London.,1
4,"Modern, expensive, but exquisite.  You could easily drop a few quid here without blinking, so choose carefully.  Everything we ordered was excellent.  Not your normal dim sum restaurant, so if you're expecting large helpings of cheap, greasy Chinese food served on carts by old Chinese women that don't speak any English try somewhere else.",1
4,"Nice place with great dim sum.  The atmosphere is swanky but not over the top.  We ate downstairs with a cool sushi-type bar that felt swanky.  Service was reasonable and so were prices.  Not sure I'd proactively rave about this place to my friends, but there was nothing particularly wrong with it.  Food was quite good.",1
5,"A totally different dining experience - excellent quality of food, a unique venue.
 Would definitely visit again.",1
4,"Though not really 100% authentic dim sum, I really did appreciate their efforts to blend east and west cuisine. The food is pretty good, but also very innovative with some creative twists on the classic cantonese style of dim sum. 
If you're looking for somewhere that's different, or perhaps an introduction into real authentic chinese food, this is the place to go. It has a nice ambiance and the wait staff is very friendly. 
The only slight problem I had was that I believe they charged for tea? That's quite unheard of for a dim sum restaurant. 
Otherwise, it's a good place to unwind and eat some dimsum.",1
4,"The dim sum is pretty expensive than other dim sum restaurants in London, but the experience at Yauatcha is topnotch. Stay for the wonderful pastries and sweet desserts after your meal, I would say that it is one of the best parts of the restaurant. Not keen on the fact that each table has a time limit of 90 minutes, but it should be more than enough time to enjoy your meal without feeling too rushed.",1
5,"I have a confession to make. I have a major dim sum weakness. So has my sister. So it only made sense that her birthday dinner should involve cakes that look so pretty it would be a crying shame to defile them by eating them (we didn't take much convincing though, no arm-twisting required) and guzzling our collective bodyweight in har gau and venison puffs. Don't do what I did and do a last minute booking (sister decided to change plans on my a day before) or you'll be put upstairs, which is very nice but not quite as pleasing on the beautifully designed basement floor. It's always packed to the rafters from Thursday onwards too, which is great when you want to have raucuous conversation with someone you've not seen in ages, without offending anyone. The service is ultra efficient and attentive. They even top up your tea for you.
 My view is this: Yauatcha is a treat for the special people in your life. So far the only people who have been taken under my steam are my mum, my sister and an ex with whom I am still friends. So if I take you to a place with a blue glass wall, you've got to be doing something right! I acknowledge the fact that the aforementioned statement is unavoidably political and likely to result in 300 odd- demands from my facebook friends to take them too, or risk being de-listed. I'll take you all when I'm a millionaire. I promise!",1
4,"Phew!  After reading the reviews, was a bit wary of the experience I was going to have at Yauatcha, but ended up having a great meal.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the food and really helpful in sorting through the maze that was the dim sum menu.  We had a friend that was running late and didn't get any of the typical attitude about a member of your table not being there, and happily grazed away on dim sum and good cocktails.  We did get reminded of the 2hr turnaround time on the table (which I absolutely loath) but fair enough on a busy night.  Nice setting, great service and good food--would definitely go back.",1
4,"Deserves its awards. One of the best Chinese restaurants in the Capital. In the cool and expensive category, at least. I went with Chinese friends from Beijing who thought that the food was very good. Believe me, they are hardly ever complimentary about Chinese food in the UK! The beefs? Well, the teas are seriously good but at £5 for a small pot they're a bit of a rip off. And the seats. Oh, the agonising kiddy height seats cunningly combined with the massive support under the table that keeps your feet folded under you. I am really short at 5'7"" and I got cramp. STILL ... I would eat there every week if I could afford it. The decor is really uber chic and the take away sweties and tea counters are good.It is not that expensive to lunch off dim sum and they are seriously good.",1
5,"OK been here a few times and wish I had more money to be a regular.
 We went for cocktails recently and chilled watching the beautiful poeple at work bring. Went for drinks and had these amazing cocktails. The drinks were amazing.
 I had the Lemongrass cocktail and as its one of my favourite ingredients to cook with in alocohol it is even better!
 Left with a box of macaroons and reliable as ever.
 I have eaten here a couple of years ago and will eat again soon as soon as the purse strings have opened up!
 We are planning to go back again in a few months for dinner.
 Just go.",1
4,"Yauatcha was recommended by a friend of mine as the informal version of London's well known restaurant Hakkasan. Alan Yau won Britain's first Michelin star for his Chinese cooking at London's Hakkasan  and has opened Yauatcha a couple of years ago.
Placed in middle of Soho my first trip there was in a rickshaw straight from a musical. We did not have a reservation and we also risked to miss the last order at 11pm at Saturday. After several left and rights in a labyrinth of narrow streets we arrives safe and sound. 
Friendly greeted we entered the ground floor of a modern decorated restaurant having our eyes drawn to gold fishes swimming in the display windows. The waiters all are dressed in a uniform designed by Tim Yip, who won an Oscar for art direction in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. During peak hours this restaurant is packed, lucky for us, we did not have to wait for a table and were seated in the chic teahouse and patisserie. 
I prefer it to the restaurant in the basement as I have to my front colourful patisseries displayed and to my back direct view into the kitchen, where Chinese chefs prepare the dim sums. Ordering several starters to share and some jasmine tea I finally get to try my prawn and date dumplings, which literally melt in my mouth. These Chinese dumplings were among the best I have ever tasted. For those who want to have a little bit more work I recommend the duck wrap.
We finally have time to relax and recover from a rather busy and packed Soho, the musical and the bumpy rickshaw ride.",1
4,"Yauatcha is a unique place for devouring Chinese food as if there's no tomorrow :)) such a chic decor, gets you in the right state of mind from the moment you enter the restaurant, the food exceeded my expectations, and I was left feeling happy, full and delighted with the flavours and mouth watering dishes  a must for all Chinese lovers!",1
1,Food to eat,-1
4,"Yuatcha was created by the same people who created Hakkasan. This is a more casual version, with dim sum served all day. I had the King crab Shanghai siew long bun (a variation of xiao loan bao). I didn't like their version really much, Hakkasan makes it better. I was excited that they had chicken feet in chlli black bean sauce here. The flavor was more prominent then normal chicken feet dim sum dishes. The best thing I had here was the prawn and beancurd cheung fun. It had such great texture and taste. The outside was soft dumpling texture, but the next inner layer was the asian churro texture (think chalupa) and filled with deliciousness. For dessert I had the warm vanilla rice pudding with banana sorbet and caramelized pineapple. It was disappointing. So I bought some of their macaroons (yuzu chocoloate, coconut, green tea, vanilla, lemon, and chocolate) to go.

The reason for coming to Yauatcha though is for the food. The menu is a playground of different flavours some of which are truly innovative.
With over 24 different Dim Sum, 150 teas and a kaleidoscope of brightly coloured pastries on display that can be boxed and taken home, Yauatcha is a place to indulge and spoil yourself, but be warned, it is expensive.",-1
5,"I typed up a massive review saying how great this place is then my computer crashed and i've lost it all. So to summarise, this place is INCREDIBLE! Everything about it is fantastic and it thoroughly deserves that Michelin star!",1
4,"After seeing pictures of the gorgeous desserts they offer, my friend and I popped in for dessert. The raspberry delice, amongst other beauties, was shaped like a rose. It tasted as good as it looked. Having a sweet tooth, I have eaten a lot of dessert in London and I have to say that this is my personal favourite. There were also hand painted london fashion week macarons, which had glitter and such decorations on flavoured shells. Also superb. I'm giving the place 4 stars as I have not tried any of their savoury offerings, but cannot recommend them enough in terms of dessert!",1
4,"When Yauatcha first opened I didn't understand the hype. And then, I went for dinner one evening.. and ended up going back so often(4x within 2 weeks) I got heartily sick of the food..! ;)
 But that's not a criticism of the dishes, because.. had I not loved the food, I would not have gone back time and again, bringing different groups of friends there.
 These days, I still visit.. but less often. I usually bring friends from out-of-town there for dim sum with a twist... if they fancy having Chinese.
 I like the fact that chefs at Yauatcha have come up with an inventive dim sum menu (and unlike other Chinese restaurants, continue serving dim sum past 5pm).
 Although, to be fair.. these days, it's not so uncommon to find innovative dim sum dishes at other Chinese restaurants, still.. I go back to Yauatcha specially for some of my favourite steamed baskets: enoki mushroom & prawn dumplings, shitake & duck roll, shanghai spicy dumplings just to name a few. The mango spring roll is sweetly delicious - just be careful not to burn your tongue in your haste to get in a yummy bite.
 I'd recommend the Singapore Fried Noodles (altho there's no such dish in Singapore!) for back up, just in case you're not full by the end of the meal.
 Be prepared to pay at least 20% more for dim sum at Yautatcha. In fact, some of their prices are exorbitant but, if you fancy a treat, then by all means, tuck in! I wouldn't recommend ordering ordinary dim sum dishes at Yauatcha (e.g. Har Gau, Siew Mai aka prawn & pork dumpling, Char Siew Pau etc)... because these, you can get at any other Chinese restaurant, and at cheaper prices too. Always go for something special and different at Yauatcha, because.. after all, you're paying for it!
 I adore their tea cocktails (non-alcoholic).. and always order a Plum Cut Larrisa when I'm there. The Mama-Zhao is nice too, if you fancy a thicker smoothie sort of drink. But everyone who's ever tried my Plum Cut Larrisa insist they want to order that on their next round. So there you go, quench your thirst!",1
5,"i keep on going back for their congee ... to me this is the best congee ... i will miss yauatcha but as a consolation, i was told that they have a sister restaurant, hakkasan in nyc!",1
4,"After a long flight , and navigating out of the madness that is London Heathrow, I looked forward to my first hot meal.  At Yauatcha.  Getting in was half the fun, since on the outside, all one saw were blue glass walls.  The space inside (the upstairs tea shop) was hip & fun and ready for the lunch crowd.  After settling in and given the complimentary Chinese pickles, i poured over the long list of items on the menu.  At Yauatcha, I really like their particular format for dim sum.  No one is pushing carts and hawking dishes, so you're not sitting there just waiting for stuff to come by.  You can order whatever you want from the menu.  Spend more time with your company, and again, just enjoy the surroundings.
For the 2 of us, we had a pot of tea, 7 dim sum items, and a rice dish.  The roasted Anxi Tie Guan Yin was very subtle, but had a mild smoky taste.  Some of the standout dishes included the Wild Mushroom Dumpling.  Oyster, shimeiji, and shitake in a chive-flavored dumpling skin, dotted on top with euryale seeds.  Perfect starter.  The Prawn Cheung Fun had the added crunch of brunoise of zucchini (or I suppose I should call it courgette as I was in London).  ;-).  The Pan-fried Turnip Cake had a whole mess of herbs and dried shrimp, a far cry from the bland affair at a lot of dim sum places.  The Sesame Prawn Toast was a throwback to my childhood.  Except here, there was a whole prawn, aside from the prawn paste.  The last dish was the Egg White & Salted Fish Fried Rice.  Typically, this dish could get bogged down with being too greasy, and too salty ingredients.  Here, it is very mild and perfectly seasoned.  A perfect finale to a perfect lunch.
Why 4 stars?  This is dim sum kicked up a few notches.  The dishes have been enhanced to make them more special.  It is in a modern, cool room  that provided a lot of the usual convivial vibe at dim sum houses.  Perhaps purists might scoff at the Westernization of it all, but i simply loved it.",1
4,I love yuatcha and always go here to satisfy a dim sum craving and then treat myself with the absolutely amazing macarons afterwards. Highly recommended.,1
5,"Wow! This place was so good, great service too. Excellent crowd, hip yet not obnoxious LA hip. Definitely will go back.",1
4,Went for some tea and desserts yesterday. Hostess wasn't too friendly but the overall experience was good. Love the contemporary decor and food was delicious. Good place to spend an afternoon chatting.,1
4,"The main reason i like this place is for their amazing desserts.  Just one peek through their window and you'll see some beautiful creations staring back at you.  The blue-cubed blueberry one is divine though i only chose it for the colour so can't be more specific in what was in it.
Second best thing is that you can get the cakes to go, which is preferable to having to actually dine in.  Not that the food or the dim sum is bad but as pointed out below the service is slow slow slow!
Recently went with a friend.  We said we just wanted cakes and were told we had 40 minutes, which would have been fine if we hadn't been ignored by all the staff having an impromptu staff meeting for 20 minutes.  We sauntered over to the dessert area and ordered our cakes and the lady placed them on a nice dish each and said someone would bring them over.  We should have taken them ourselves as we waited over 5 minutes and we severely pushed for time.
For quality of food this places rates highly but it has a long way to go to even be close to an enjoyable experience.",1
4,great up scale chinese food.  really good execution on a lot of classic chinese dishes.  better value that Hakkasan,1
5,"Very impressed with this one. Have only been once, but went for the afternoon tea (£28 for two, weekdays 3pm-6pm) which was extremely generous in size and absolutely delicious. Not the best dim sum I've ever had, but there's a great ambience and it was absolutely delicious. For the money, I don't think you can do much better in London.",1
4,"Even though this place is known for its dim sum, it definitely brings a few twists to the entire experience. The atmosphere is so much more different to those you'd find not too far away in Chinatown, a combination between dark wooden panels, bright blue colours and a very colourful fishtank (I'm assuming filled with tropical fish).
 The dim sum is definitely of a much higher standard with some different twists including a number of dumplings with game meats in them. Of course, you will end up spending a little bit more on dim sum compared to other places, but it's great for something out of the ordinary.
 Their tea selection is also significantly different for those that want something other than the standard Chinese selection.",1
4,"Yauatcha does the most fantastic generous afternoon teas. I highly recommend ordering one to share between two as an alternative to late lunch. They always serve a small selection of dim sum (including venison steamed buns which they are famous for), along with demi versions of their cakes, macaroons and truly wonderful scones. Quite often I taken friends there on a Saturday at about 3 for a late lunch. I usually order a couple of other plates of dimsum and then share the tea. Otherwise, if you haven't tried it, the cactus lime truffles are heavenly.",1
4,"My friend took me here as a birthday treat and i was pleasantly surprised. The dim sum dishes offered are quite innovative and the noodle dishes were nice and a good size. There is a wonderful selection of teas also.
 The only thing I didn't like too much was the slightly rushed service during the meal.
 Other than that I would probably go back again for a special occasion, and even more so just to visit the shop upstairs that sells the wonderful macaroons. Lots of different flavours, the Pandan flavour is awesome!",1
5,"A favourite. Posh dim sum sums it up. The food is fresh - you can see it being made and then cooked. The decor is superb - sleek and sophisticated. The service is really efficient and pleasant - never pushy, always attentive and precise.
 A huge range of green, blue, and smoked teas are available and the staff are always happy to recommend something that goes well with the food you've ordered. The food is classic Chinese fusion but steers clear of the outlandish or merely sensational. Quality and flavour is the keynote.
 To finish, select gold leaf topped violet and rose flavoured cakes or light chocoloate mousses topped with lime flower and candied cinammon. Just looking at the cakes makes you think you've gone to some kind of food heaven.
 Innovative cocktails and soft drinks complete the 'event' that each meal here inevitably becomes. It's a treat.",1
5,"Oh my goodness I'm soooo in love with Yauatcha. I don't think I was a fan of dimsum before I ate here and now I love. Love love love. Even if i can't pronounce the name.
 I let my friends order whatever the felt was right and they did a damn good job. Highlights were Salt and Pepper squid, Deep fried Quail (it was like posh KFC - fatty and sweet and brilliant) and the sea bass and crab dumplings were pretty amazing too.
 This is the best Chinese food I've eaten in London. There's a great atmosphere. It's buzzy enough to be fun, but dark and quiet enough to be romantic if you wanted to come here with your other half (and it would impress on a date as well - take note people).
 Cocktails are amazing. Huge. With flowers in and stuff. But you don't get drunk. You drink them because they're yummy. They do a ginger mojito thing which is great.
 I love it here. I really love it here. It's not cheap - drinks and dinner will set you back about fifty quid a head (although I reckon if you were a couple it would be much less as you wouldn't order so many dishes between you - maybe about £30?), but it doesn't matter once you're here. It's all worth every penny.
 Can someone please take me back there?",1
4,"If you are looking for a dim sum experience beyond the usual Chinatown stuff, then Yauatcha is one place to go (Royal China Club is another good one). Like other Alan Yau creations, you'll find chic decor, plus well-dressed waitresses.
 For around 3 to 5 pounds, you'll get a serving of dim sum. My favourites include the pork and prawn shui mai and the simple chive dumplings. There's also a number of different types of teas on offer, unlike other places.
 One problem we had was the 2 hour time limit, though it was partly our fault as some of us reached late. But otherwise, we had a good dim sum experience here.",1
4,"I simply love dim sum and I will go all out to try different venues and types of dim sum. This is an amazing place for dim sum another of Alan Yau's creation! Good things never come cheap, so expect about £40-£50 per head. However expensive, the exceptional food is well worth it! The interior is quite charming, dark and modern opposing to the usual Chinese restaurant setting. It provides quite a pleasant twist from the mundane which complemented the unusual ingredients for some of the dim sum selection as well. The variety of tea leaves available is huge including hand rolled ones as well!
One downside of this restaurant is the service. The place is constantly packed during peak hours and the number of waiters / waitresses is insufficient to cope with the crowded, very often you will need to wait for quite a while before being served!",1
4,"Hot on the heels, okay well two weeks after, of Yauatcha being sold by creator Alan Yau to a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority I decided to finally check out the dim sum on offer by the restaurant. The premium price tag on the dim sum has previously prevented us from treating this place as an every day dim sum dining experience but we thought we better get in to check it out before there was any change to the formula that has so far proven to be a major success for Alan Yau.
 Blue is the overriding colour when you first behold the sight that is Yauatcha. Upon entering the restaurant you will see before you an elegant brightly lit modern and cleanly designed room. I'm not sure if bookings are still essential but today at just after noon we were able to dine as walk-ins. We were actually taken downstairs today where there is still a theme of blue from the frosted glass that covers the kitchen and the chefs to the long aquarium running across the front of the bar filled with bright colourful goldfish but suddenly we were plunged into darkness - a Ping Pong-ish style of decor.
 The service is as you would expect in a restaurant of this calibre - efficient, friendly and accommodating. Upon first sitting you are presented with the drinks menu which is an almost overwhelming list of teas and wines. You won't find bottomless pots of simple tea here - not like the pots of tea you get at regular dim sum places at any rate. There's a large variety of blue tea, black tea, green tea and flower tea on also. Not to mention they also have a wide selection of iced teas amongst which I can recommend the Lime and Passion Ice Tea which is my dining partner had and the Melon Ice Tea - both of where were extremely refreshing.
 The dim sum menu features some of the regulars such as Har Gau, Shumai, Cheung Fun, and Steam Pork Bun. There were also a number of items I'd never seen before on a dim sum menu a couple of which we tried out including Ostrich Dumplings (quite delicious and self-saucing) and Baked Venison Puff (very similar to Barbecue Pork Puff but obviously with venison.) As the prices were quite high we couldn't be too adventurous but it would have been interesting to try other dishes such as Chilean Sea Bass Mooli Roll, Native Lobster in Black Bean Sauce, Wagyu Beef Cheung Fun, and Box Dumpling. We couldn't resist the Jasmine Tea Smoked Organic Ribs, which we also sampled when we went to sister restaurant Hakkasan. They weren't too bad but not nearly as tasty or fall off the bone as the ones from Hakkasan.
 The price tag for our one meal today would have bought us two meals at any other restaurant but it was worth it to check out the hype that is Yauatcha.",1
5,"Situated on one of the crappiest streets in London, honestly the market is a dive, is a gem of a Chinese restaurant. It's stylish design stands out amongst the fish-sellers and spread over two floors you should always manage to get a table, though it's advisable to book for large parties.
Food wise there is a wealth of choice, from gorgeous dim sum to set meals. The drinks menu also offers a wide choice but the main attraction, for me at least, are the beautiful desserts that they have. Glorious creations beautifully presented and, though at £4.50 each, they are a bit pricey one bite will assure you that it's worth it You can also by desserts to take out which is perfect for any special occasion or indulgent snacking.
As stated, prices aren't cheap but not overly extortionate either. Service can be a bit slow considering the wealth of staff that they employ but on all occasions I've been there staff have been very helpful, offering suggestions to compliment choices rather than to run up the bill.
Definitely a place to try",1
5,"I went there with 5 friends to celebrate Bday. We had a lot of different starters, mains and deserts. Food was amazing service too. Place is quite expensive. Dinner for 6 without wine £600. I will definitely recommend this restraunt and will get beck there one day ;-)))",1
4,"The thing I really like about this place is the variety it offers. The dim sum is amazing, but there are a number of other dishes on its menu that really are beautiful - for example, the baked cod, which was the best fish I've ever had. And yes, the Venison Puffs are unique!
 The venue itself is just on the right side of pretentious. It was relaxed, yet bustling and the decor was really chilled. However, it won't be long before it needs a refit, as I'm sure it will begin to look a bit dated over the next year or two.
 So, you may not want to believe the hype, but give it a go. I had an amazing meal and will be going back for yet another visit fairly soon.",1
5,"A fantastic selection of cakes, teas and juices. A nice place to enjoy high tea in a different atmosphere to the traditional english one.
 I went with friends and we enjoyed a cake and a drink eah, Staff were courteous even though we weren't dressed up to the nines, and the cakes were amazing. So much thought had gone into the ingredients of each one.
 Yauatcha is a real treat when you are out and about in London, even if you just stop by to look at the cakes in the window because you don't have enough money to stop in on that occasion!
 I haven't tried the dim-sun but I imagine it is as well polished as the rest of this chic cafe/restaurant.",1
3,"Great place for a variety of tea's and cake in an upmarket surrounding.
 They used to do three scones in a cream tea style that was really good value for money, but alas I believe that's no more.
 Downstairs hosts dim-sum and is good, well portioned, good flavours although you are paying for it.
 Really good surroundings and decor though!",-1
4,"Just got back from lunch at Yauatcha. Delicious!
Liked the decor, too, although maybe a bit dark in the basement for lunchtime, would love to come back one evening.
We ordered lots of different dishes and shared them, but they all tasted amazing. Particularly the duck roll!
I got taken here on a business lunch so didn't have to pay, otherwise the visit might have left a bigger dent in my purse than I would have preferred. But as I said, it was delicious, so maybe worth it!",1
4,"This is my favorite Dim Sum house in London. Every trip to London requires a visit and a big purchase of delectable pastries and other goodies. I tend to hold camp here for meetings as the atmosphere is perfect. I prefer to sit upstairs as the air is light (after all, I only go during the daytime). 
All the pastries are amazing and they seem to introduce something new and innovative every few months. Perfect for my regular quarterly visits. BUT, what never ceases to amaze me the most is their packaging. Superb is all I can say. The packaging alone is worth visiting and collecting.
Yauatcha will always be a favorite (and easier to get a table at than the big-brother Hakkasan).",1

 Yauatcha was stunning. I was fortunate enough to be part of a corporate night out which included dinner at this restaurant. We entered the restaurant for our 7:00 reservation and had a short wait in the front shop area which is exquisitely designed and sells a selection of macaroons and chocolates in house. They are extremely tempting and a few in our party bought a selection to take home.
 We were lead downstairs to the restaurant which is a square brick room with a partially hidden kitchen, sparkly lights on the ceiling (sounds tacky  it isn't) and cut outs in the brick with faux candles. I can imagine what the room must have looked like at one time, and am very impressed with what they've done.
 The service was absolutely stunning, and I can hand on heart say it was probably the best service I have ever had especially considering we were a group. At one point the manager came to me (I was the organizer) and asked me how my food was. He then very specifically asked how the service was and to please tell him if there was anything. It was extremely sincere and very surprising. A colleague later told me that the reviews about their service on the website were very poor so this appears to be something they are working hard on and have completely turned around. This is impressive, and if you were ever put off from a visit because of this I recommend you visit. For the food I just asked them to bring us a selection to the table. It was brought in even intervals without any long waits, and the empty dishes were quickly whisked away. If we needed another glass or bottle of wine it was almost immediate. I couldn't believe it. We were all very impressed.
 The food was also very good. Highlights for me were the Beancurd Cheung Fun which I believe was beancurd and pork in a long roll, the scallop shumai with the most exquisitely cooked scallops, and the Ribeye Beef in Black Bean sauce. I didn't try it but was told that the Orchid Pao Chung (Orchid Tea) was amazing. They chose a wide range of dishes for us, and served a perfect amount of food. We didn't drink a lot (3 bottles of wine for 9 people) but it turned out to around £46 per person including tip which is fabulous.
 I can't wait to go back, and hope it can live up to my previous experience!

4,"Crispy aromatic duck was amazing!  Loved the decor, food and vibe of this very crowded restaurant.  The staff had a bit of a problem with our order for a wine flight but eventually got it to us with an extra glass to make up for the wait.  The wines were all top notch.  Would recommend this restaurant.",1
2,"Went on the 1-Jan-13 to welcome in the new year and it was very busy as expected. Quality of food was very good though but the experience was totally ruined by an obnoxious and sarcastic waiter. Service was downright unacceptable as he keeps forgetting our order of extra drinks / coffee and we even have to ask the dessert menu twice. Said waiter always avoided eye-contact and finally we decided to complaint to the manager. We told her to take the discretionary service charge off the bill and she kindly obliged. She apologised for the unpleasant service experienced by us and even took off 2 of our desserts order from the final bill.
We appreciated her help / offer but sadly, I don't think I will be back in a hurry. Don't mind splashing out for good quality food on special occasions but service level was just atrocious! We overheard the same service problem on an adjacent table before we left. I would have thought for the price they are charging, the least they could do is provide decent service. As I mentioned, food is great but let down terribly by their unprofessional service!!!",-1
4,"Yauatcha is yummy. Desserts are to die for, french patisserie with asian influences, like kiwi tiramisu. A lot of dim sum varieties for a pretty reasonable price although if you add in a few main courses it can get a bit expensive. Upstairs has a more casual feel while downstairs is dark and suitably trendy. definitely worth a visit or two",1
4,"Yauatcha has become a must everytime I visit London. The menu is very diverse but I end up ordering the soup dumplings, sticky rice and pork and shrimp dumplings every time I come.",1
4,"It is a strange day when I find myself reviewing a bit of cake, but needs must.
 If looks dictated the flavour then this cake could well be the best in all the kingdom, but they don't, so it's not.
 It's deceptively heavy looking from the outside, however, once inside it has a surprisingly good mixture of light textures and flavours which left me wanting another fork full. A sophisticated fusion of tastes and textures. Very good indeed, but still not the best in the kingdom.
 The shop itself is a delight. A huge array of incredibly good looking cakes. It's a photographers dream (as well as a foodies).",1
5,"The best dim sum in London. Once you've been here, you won't go anywhere else.",1
5,"Yauatcha, part of Alan Yau's growing restaurant empire, is an ultra hip tea house and dim sum eatery. It is my favorite place for dim sum and drinks. The stunning interior reminds me of something out of Tokyo. Upstairs contains a cozy, relaxed environment to enjoy with friends and a pastry counter which has some of the best sweets ever as well as teas, candles, and other treats. Downstairs is dimly lit with the kitchen overlooking the crowded space, best for an intimate dinner. I dream about Yauatcha's dumplings, pork buns, and desserts. You will to after trying this Soho hot spot.",1
4,"We went on Sunday... After me not being there for 2 years. Much different vibe on a Sunday afternoon versus a Friday night during much better times! I was pleasantly surprised with the families there. Sure its not authentic dining but I am one for a beautifully designed restaurant, excellent service and yummy food which this one does. I think our waitress persuaded us to order a little too much, which we were happy to eat but still a little too much. Duck salad and prawn toast very recommended. What I have been doing there for the last year is buying their sweet macaroons as hostess gifts, they look great and the packaging is original.",1
4,"A nice place to go for a special occasion--but you will end up paying at least twice what dimsum in Chinatown will cost you.
 What the premium pricing does get you, however, is some of the freshest dumplings you will ever have tasted. The dimsum tastes like it is made to order, unlike the mass produced stuff that has been sitting in bamboo steamers all morning. There are also many items on the menu that are certainly not-dimsum or Asian at all: honey glazed lamb ribs, venison puff pastry, etc., that are an interesting take on fusion cuisine.
 People often talk about the decor here: it is an interesting modern and trendy looking space but very un-Chinese. In fact, other than the kitchen staff, almost everyone else you will encounter (at the door or serving your food) will be Caucasian PYTs of both genders. The experience felt more LA than London.
 So save up some money and give the place a try, and you'll walk away with a dimsum experience you will still be talking about a year later.",1
4,"A stunning tea-house and restaurant, I've been here a number of times and have never failed to have a wonderful meal.  Which is great because this is one of only a few London hotspots that is both oh-so-trendy and consistently worthy of its price tag.  
I love being delighted by food, and Yauatcha gives a lot:  I fondly remember the venison puffs and shitake and duck rolls... and you'll write home about the ostrich dumplings.  
My only negatives:  (1) some items, like the duck pancakes, are no better than you can find elsewhere, (2) the service - kind but they often strictly enforce the 2-hour table rule (they once slapped our receipt down before we could order dessert).",1
4,"My first Alan Yau's restaurant in London was the famous Hakkasan which won first Michelin star for its Chinese cuisine. It's a wonderful place. Once again I wanted to have some Dim Sum for brunch. But I wanted to change and that's why Piotr and I have been to Yauatcha. This restaurant has a tea-room on the ground floor and a Dim Sum restaurant in the basement. As we had drunk a lot of beer these last two days, we decided to be reasonable and ordered rest silver needle tea... light and delicious. Then we had a Beancurd Cheung Fun (Pan-fried bean curd with prawns and yellow chives), Har Gau (Scallops and prawns with fish eggs), Szechuan wonton (another kind of dumplings), Prawn Ho Fun (stir-fried noodles with prawns) and Malaysian Kweito. Everything was absolutely delicious. Only the Kweito was not my cup of tea. Really, it's a nice place to visit while in London. Don't pay attention to the waiters who can be from indifferent to obsequious.",1
5,Beautiful place with delicious food. Dim Sum heaven.,1
3,"I came here having been hooked and reeled in by the spotlit rows of immaculate cakes in the window. But once in, I couldn't just order cake could I? So myself and a friend managed to share a fair few char sui buns and some gyoza dumplings between us before getting down to business with a crazily geometric pineapple concoction and a layered coffee and cream tart. It felt almost wrong eating these 'creations', they seemed just too perfect to look at. We finished with a jasmine tea, served in a delightful traditional jug. I would have to agree with other reviewers though, and say that for a pricey restaurant such as this to make such an effort with its food only to be let down by its waiter service is slightly sad.",-1
5,"Alan Yaus signature Chinese restaurant that started the whole dim-sum craze in London. The original, and still the best, dim-sum fine-dining experience in the city. Situated in the heart of Soho - the people who come here are a mix of celebrities and foodies. The décor is stunning, from the ground floor restaurant to the bustling downstairs eatery, flanked by fish tanks and cool, minimalist décor. Always busy so definitely book ahead. Only downer is they only give you 90 minutes to have your meal. Go anyway, you won't be disappointed.",1
4,"yauatcha is a temple where i go to revere the soft shell crab, squid with chili, baby steamed vegetables and tea smoked ribs. as chinese retaurants go, this is a triumph. brilliant on all accounts. my only issue: the cruelly-enforced 2 hours maximum table time. unless i am mistaken, yauatcha is a one-star michelin restaurant come on, guys, you can't push your customers out at gun point, especially given these prices.",1
5,Thought this was great  had a twisted ankle when I went though so getting down the stairs was a challenge. Lovely staff let me use the lift  it was a goods lift though and I think it came out near the kitchen. Nice flavour and very good food,1
5,Prices are expensive but this is unique Chinese food in London,1
5,"DIM SUM fans your temple awaits, on wandering Londons soho we came across this gem after making good our escape from a cutpurse loitering in the quieter parts of Soho, which was lucky for him as we were not the lost tourist fodder he took us for. On entering the ground floor we were shown downstairs to our table. The decor is an ultra modern take on Buddist calm, hundreds of pin point lights in the ceiling and candles in recesses in walls. The food? simply the best I have tasted, prepared by artisan chefs, and as fresh as you'll find anywhere, particular favorites are the venison dumplings, although the whole menu is mouth watering and making your choice is not easy, so allow time to enjoy and savor the experience. Being in Soho, as one would expect, the waiters are groomed and runway thin, and the service is attentive and informed. Love it. Bill: £150 inc drinks, two covers.",1
5,Amazing is the only word for this place! Make sure you sit downstairs as its majical with little starry lights and gorgeous decor. Upstairs is really nice for tea and cake but it's definitely a must for dinner. It's not the cheapest of places but i'd say it was worth the pennies.,1
4,"I've never been to the restarant downstairs for dim sum (but i hear great things) but i have sat upstairs for an afternoon sipping chinese tea and eating cakes. My friend took a few of us there for her birthday one year as it was a lovely way to spend the afternoon. It was very sophisticated and a different way to enjoy your birthday. I didn't love all the cakes, but we got to have a good selection so im sure there's something for everyone.",1
5,"I went here twice in 3 days. It's that good! I was worried that the second time would disappoint but not the case. First of all, be prepared to wait an hour (we went on a Friday night and on a Sunday night and waited both nights). But you can enjoy a delicious cocktail at the bar while you wait. I enjoyed the Viceroy Manhattan. Boozy and delicious!
My favorite dishes were chicken ruby and black daal. Holy moly. Talk about complex, rich flavor. The daal has a bit of creaminess (it's vegan so I don't what they put in here!) that I've never tasted in a daal and that I was so here for. The chicken ruby is just beyond words. Also good were the lamb mimosas, lamb chops, the puffed poori with chickpea curry, cheese bread and the roti.
The lamb raan bun (basically a lamb sandwich)  and the chicken tikka rolls were fine but underwhelming compared to the others that hit the spot.  
I'll come here (at least once!) every time I'm in London.",1
4,"I would post a photo but it would have been of our empty plates. 
The place is huge, yet intimate. It's loud but in the best ways. The menu is extensive but everything we tried was solid. We went on a Saturday and it was busy but they have the most amazing bar where you can sip on some hand crafted cocktails and socialize. 
I was visiting from Southern California and would have loved to see a concept like this in our area. We will be back!",1
4,"This will be review no. 350 for this particular branch of Dishoom reflecting just how popular this chain of Indian street food has become. I'll be keeping this one short as everything has been said before.
There are always queues but it's worth the wait - our estimated 1 hour 20 minutes turned into about half an hour's wait before a table became available. The interim at the bar was a bit stressful as there just wasn't enought space. When we finally found a table to perch on, staff were very helpful and we relaxed with our first drink.
By now we all have our favourites at Dishoom and mine's the okra chips. We shared a selection of daal and chicken dishes, everyone was happy.",1
5,One of the best Indian restaurants ever! So sad this is located in London and no where near Chicago! I dislike Indian food but was so amazed at the quality of the food and the price! I cannot wait to travel back to London to eat here. Try to make reservations as people have been know to wait hours to get in!! You won't regret coming here while visiting London! Wishing I was there right now!,1
5,"Another trip to London another Dishoom. After experiencing the bacon naan during our previous visit I knew it was going to be a #1 priority for this one.
The shoreditch location has a super cute outdoor space with plastic walls that shelter you from the elements. It has cozy (but very worn and not so comfortable) sofas where you can sit and enjoy a leisurely breakfast to start your day. We ordered a bacon naan roll each as well as chai (endless refills) each and a buttery bun maska to share. 
The food came out quickly and was all around excellent and delicious. This will definitely be on my food list for my next visit as well.",1
5,"Came here on a trip. I asked around for recommendations for a good food spots in London. Everyone mentioned Dishoom and now I see why. It was a cool spot we went at a good time and didn't have to wait in line but 30 minutes after we got there it became really crowded. We Got about eight dishes and split it amongst five people. My favorite was the non-and side dips. 
The service was excellent. Everyone is very nice and accommodating with substitutions. One of my new favorite Indian spots!",1
5,"Hands down my favorite Indian restaurant in London, maybe even ever ( apart from being in India). This place is always packed! I've come for both dinner and lunch and lunch appears to be the easier time to get a spot. Dinner time, the lines are massive and you're likely going to wait for 1-2 hours, IT IS WORTH IT. 
Last time I was in town, I waited close to an hour and we were starving! But it gave us more of a reason to order everything on the menu. I heard today that they are finally taking reservations, so that's an option! 
The patio seating out front is amazing. The weather was great today and we were able to snag a table right away (it was 12:15! So we were lucky). We ordered quite a bit of food for two people, but we devoured it. The black daal is a must order! Get some butter naan and garlic naan to go with it. You will not be disappointed. We also ordered the paneer which was nice and spicy.",1
4,Super fun and flavorful modern Indian place.  Definitely come early as lines are long and they don't take reservations.  We sat on the patio on a beautiful summer evening and enjoyed a huge range of dishes to share. Cocktails are also creative and refreshing. I can understand why Dishoom locations are so popular!,1
4,"When I visited London, I obviously wanted to try cuisines that the city was known for. In other words, what kind of food do I eat when in London? You know...ones I can't find in the US? So I made a basic list: English breakfast, Indian food, Fish and Chips.
For Indian food, I decided to try Dishoom. I was informed by my friend that anyone who visits London to check out Dishoom. So...I did. I yelped it and was supremely excited to see lots of positive reviews. As such, we headed out to Dishoom in Shoreditch for dinner that night. 
Reservations are recommended to guarantee a table, otherwise I highly suggest you arrive early. Remember, Shoreditch is where the techies work so there's lots of people in the area. We went at 6pm and we were lucky to snag a table. But around 7-8pm, there was a long queue to get in. Dishoom's reputation definitely lived up to the hype for being a well known establishment.
Ambience is quite lovely. The place had a very tavern feel to it; clean and professional. The employees were very nice and friendly. They greeted us formally as we walked in. It was, however, a bit dark but the lighting made it very exciting and appealing. We were seated downstairs which looked like a basement where you house and age wine. It was dope.
Our waitress was very kind, attentive and responsive. Most importantly, she was well informed about the menu. She fielded all our questions and made key recommendations. 
For my drink, I ordered their very own Dishoom IPA. It wasn't too bitter, and actually surprisingly smooth. Lighter than the usual IPA but I liked it.
For appetizers were ordered Pau Bhaji, Lamb Samosas, and Dishoom Calamari.
OK THE PAU BHAJI was the BEST dish from my entire experience. The waitress recommended this and I was extremely pleased by it. It's a bowl of mashed vegetables with hella butter and they give you homemade buns to eat with. Absolutely tasty and delicious. This is a must order here. Also, it's a Bombay thing, so try it to fully immerse yourself in the Dishoom experience. 
Lamb Samosas - I'm not a big fan of lamb, but it was very well spiced and delicious. Point is, I enjoyed it despite disliking the taste of lamb.
Dishoom Calamari - it was ok. Tasted like any other calamari dish I've had. A tiny bit disappointed here but not big deal.
For our main courses, we ordered Murgh Malai, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Masala Prawns, House Black Daal, and Chicken Berry Britannia. 
Murgh Malai - It was cooked very properly, but wasn't flavorful. It was ok, not bad.
Dishoom Chicken Tikka - A bit disappointed because I had better Chicken Tikka, but still good. Not amazingly good.
Masala Prawns - Grilled well, tasted good, needs a bit more seasoning. 
House Black Daal - Dishooms signature dish. Very well made and unique consistency in terms of texture. I liked it very much. My 2nd favorite dish next to the Pau Bhaji. Must order.
Chicken Berry Britannia - Had well chosen mix of spices but I was disappointed because it was drier than what I was used to. Spices were well played though. 
Would I come back? Absolutely! I would also recommend this place to anyone visiting London. They have to stop by and check it out.",1
5,"It would have been easy to let the two hour line on a Saturday night or the ridiculous phone reservation system that kept me on hold for 10 minutes deter me, but I'm glad I didn't. (To be fair I DID see them bring out platters of drinks to the people in that two hour line.) When I got a reservation for lunch on a weekday, I informed the family, ""We're going to Dishoom now! Chop chop!."" 
We sat outside on the charming verandah that gives the illusion that you are sitting inside. (Another interesting decor element are the Crapper brand pull-above-you-to-flush toilets in the bathrooms.)
The samosas were excellent. I loved the addition of cinnamon and clove. Unlike some samosas elsewhere, these were wrapped in filo. The chana salad included pomegranate seeds, golden raisins, and chickpeas, and reminded us of jhalmuri.
The black dal is advertised on the menu as dal for people who don't like dal. I think that's because it's in a makhani-like sauce. We were told we needed it as a sauce for grilled items. After trying it that way I disagree that it's a necessity. I've had tikka lots of times without a sauce. The chicken tikka was very flavorful, clearly marinated for some time and nicely spiced. The gunpowder potatoes were really good and served with yogurt. The naan was fine. 
I was impressed that the children's menu was not dumbed down to only offer pizza and chicken fingers like at many places.. My kids had basa marinated in yogurt with Bombay potatoes (same potatoes as ours) and kuchumber, along with a choice of juice. They had fresh squeezed o.j.
They offered two types of chai - be still my (jittery caffeinated) heart. The regular chai was too spicy and a tad bitter, but I liked the spices. The chocolate chai was really great. I did notice when I got my chai refill that other than the cocoa on the rim of the glass and the whipped cream, it actually tasted a lot like the chocolate chai. Could the cocoa on the rim be masking the spiciness and bitterness? Either way, intriguing...
The food was all uniformly good. It was hard to decide on a best item. We decided it was on par with Sakoon (the husband gave the edge to Sakoon), an Indian restaurant in our city of Mountain View, located in Silicon Valley - another area with a large Indian community. So if you like Dishoom, now you know where to go in the Bay Area.",1
5,"So many people recommended this spot to me and I'm glad I went - really great and unique food!
I visited here twice for breakfast and really enjoyed my experience:
Kejriwal - such a unique and tasty plate of eggs and toast , but with a twist...everything tasted fresh and I loved the balance of spices used to make this fantastic dish. As far as I know, this is a one-of-a-kind dish and you have to get this when you're here.
Chocolate Chai - this is a really good blend of chai and dark chocolate...the drink was spiced with the perfect blend and the chocolate adds another layer of uniqueness to the drink. It wasn't too sweet and a perfect drink to start the day.
The service was good and attentive...there's a reason why people rave about this place!",1
4,"Enjoyed this hip Indian restaurant in Shoreditch!
This was the first restaurant that we went to once we landed in London. We missed our original lunch time reservation, but they were able to accommodate us at 2 
pm on a Friday. They kindly introduced us to the bar and let us know we could order some drinks while we wait. Soon after we ordered, they had a table available for 2!
The service was great. Our waitress was pleasant and attentive. The food was good! 
There were some sauces that came with our apps, was a fan of the green sauce.
What we ordered:
Lamb samosas - soo good, prob my fave thing honestly. Crispy and flavorful.
Okra fries: delish but gotta be a fan of okra's gooey texture
Spicy lamb chops: yummy! Flavorful and tender.
Chicken ruby curry: tasty curry!
Garlic naan: good because it's naan, but lacking in the garlic flavor department
To sum it up, everything was yummy, but not like out of this world delicious. Also, I was so glad we did not smell like food after we left especially since we had to be out and about. Def make a stop if you can. Get the lamb samosas!",1
5,"Honestly the best Indian food I've ever had. It's a little pricey, but worth it! 
I came on a Friday afternoon and had NO wait! I had:
- the unlimited chai tea (tasted lovely, not too sweet and not too much spice) 2.50
-prawn koliwada 6.20 .. id say pass on this. For the price the spice wasn't the best
-house black daal 5.90 must try with garlic naaan! 2.90
-chicken ruby 9.50 my favorite part of the meal!!! The chicken was super tender and the sauce was full of flavor.",1
3,"We came around 5 pm for dinner. Did not need a reservation but the restaurant was quite busy. Filled up by around 6. 
For two, we ordered the veggie samosas, garlic naan, chicken biryani and 1 lamb chop. The veggie samosa were very well seasoned and on the sweet side. The biryani and naan were nothing special. The lamb was tender and flavourful. Overall the meal was just average and did not live up to the hype. 
The portions we ordered were enough for us, but may not be enough if you guys are really hungry.",-1
5,"Ok ok I admit Dishoom is really good. I don't love that you know you're going to be waiting at least an hour for food, but, the food is actually really good.
We came here with some friends on a week day evening around 6:30 and waited about an hour. But within 15 minutes we were warm inside and able to buy drinks, and those cold 15 minutes we were offered chai and peppermint tea! So life isn't so hard after all.
Anyway, after the wait we were taken to a lovely table and super cozy chairs. I was really excited to sit in the front area! Our server was very attentive and friendly, and the food was delish. 
We had veggie samosas, lady fingers (fried okra), chilli garlic bread, mattar paneer (veggie curry) jack fruit biryani, paneer tikka and mashed spicy potatoes. Everything was delicious but I was especially blown away by the mattar paneer and the jackfruit biryani. The curry was especially creamy and flavourful, but the biryani was really the star because that jackfruit tasted so meaty and had the best flavour and texture! Yes please I'd definitely get it again.
And I'll come again and be happy to wait :)",1
4,"Came here during my first night in London. Got there and was told the wait for 2 people would be 1hr+, but my coworker said they're usually faster than the estimate so we went inside and got drinks. While we were in line to check in, a waitress came by holding free samples of sherry, chai, and champagne - how delightful! 
By the time we got a spot at the bar and ordered/received our drinks, we were called to our table. We got a chance to through the menu while we were waiting at the bar so we knew what we wanted to order when we got seated. This has to be the favorite place I ate at during my short trip in London. 
We ordered a variety of things: the lamb chops (my fave!), chicken curry, garlic naan, corn on the cob, a salad, and some other vegetable dish.  Our waitress was great - she was super friendly and gave us recommendations. Everything was delicious! I would definitely come back to try other menu items. They also have free wifi (for those traveling with no cell service like me).",1
5,"I personally not a big fan of Indian food.  But this place completely changed me, the food is so delicious and perfect.  Even the washroom is nicely decorated.  The only downside is the wait time, we came here twice and both times we need to wait for at least 1 hr and of course no reservation can be made.",1
4,"Heard this place was hard to get into but we made a reservation for an early dinner at 5 p.m. and got in with no problems. There were several empty tables around us but they quickly filled up as we got closer to 6 p.m. This location is fairly big with two levels of seating and an outdoor patio. The downstairs space seems to be a little more romantic.
We started with an appetizer of vegetable samosas, which were perfectly cooked and served with 3 different chutneys. After that we shared the sheekh lamb kebabs, biryani rice and naan. Everything was great! only complaint was that the lamb kebabs were a little dry but the flavor was excellent. 
Staff was friendly and attentive and they had a great cocktail/wine/cider list. Highly recommend this place if you love Indian cuisine and are looking for great food and a lively atmosphere!",1
4,"One of the most beautiful and impeccably-decorated period-style restaurants, with one caveat: you cannot book a table. This place would surely be 5 stars if they instituted a booking process. Waiting for an hour or more in the (a more than 50% chance of) rain is not the best way to start out a dinner. But the fact that we muddled through this uncomfortable process and still managed to enjoy our meals is probably testament to how great the atmosphere and food inside actually are. 
As other reviewers have mentioned, Dishoom is modeled off of Irani cafés that sprouted in Bombay in the early 1900s. Trying to emulate that upper-class convivial café culture while offering exotic twists on high-end cocktails, Dishoom has hit the nail on the head for Indian Chic. Everything is good. The garlic naan is luscious. The curries are outstanding. Don't forget the dals or chickpea dishes. Sublime! They service breakfast as well. The vibe here is ""come in and hang out."" If you can get in the door, that is.",1
5,"best Indian food i've ever had!! I came here 3 nights in a row to try and get a table. On the first two nights, the wait was 90 minutes, so I went elsewhere. On the third night, the wait was 45 minutes. I decided to take the chance and wait, and I'm glad I did. 
I ordered the Chicken Ruby and Garlic Naan.  Prices are a little high for the portions, but I expected that since it's The chicken was so juicy and tender, and the flavors were amazing. The garlic naan was also very good and tasted fresh. I dipped the naan in my chicken ruby as well as the three sauces they put on each table. All the sauces were delicious but unique. 
I'm happy I decided to wait for Dishoom, and I would wait an hour and a half if I came back!",1
4,"Amazing place.  Glad we stopped by.  Friendly staff and fantastic food.  Enough food to share. The food came in less than 15 minutes. 
Make a reservation on their site to avoid lines.",1
5,"First time eating Indian food and what a great experience it was! The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor verandah style seating, which makes you feel as if you are eating dinner in the family room of a house. Low coffee like tables, sofas and a fireplace set the mood. 
We decided to try and share a variety of plates and some drinks to make sure we experienced as many of the menu offerings as possible. For drinks we went with the Kingfisher beer, typical Indian beer, which was light and refreshing. We paired the beer with the Dishoom Calamari to snack on. The calamari deserves a shoutout as it was not only crunchy but the Dishoom drizzle really made it spectacular with its not too potent garlicky and sweet taste. 
As the main entrees we shared garlic naan bread, basmati rice, the Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Lamb Boti Kabab, House Black Daal and the Chicken Ruby (chicken curry). Everything was uniquely spicy and flavorful. The lamb was tender, the chicken curry sauce creamy, the Chicken Tikka well marinated in ginger juice and the lentils went perfectly over the rice.
To finish off our meal we shared the Dishoom chocolate pudding, which was reminiscent of a molten lava cake and some liquor infused chai - naughty chocolate chai and bailey's chai. 
Dishoom definitely set the bar high for Indian food and I hope I can find similar places back home. Otherwise, I'm back to London for some more Dishoom!",1
4,"The good, the ok and the ugly 
The ugly: 
- We had to wait for 30 mins to get to the bar and another hour to get a table
- They lost our credit card :(
The ok:
- Drinks at the bar and the dinning room were different and I preferred the drinks at the bar - wish I could order more from there
The good: 
- While we were in line they brought out masala chai!
-  The drinks at the bar were super unique and tasty 
-  The food was delicious. Some of my favorites lamb chops, Ruby chicken, okra fries, prawns koliwada. Things you can skip lamb raan bun and chili cheese toast.
- They felt terrible about losing our card so the meal was on the House :)",1
5,"Stumbled on this gem by accident and it was a real treat!  As soon as we turned the corner we could tell we were in the right place by the aroma in the air.  Dont be discouraged by the lines, grab a drink, socialize with friendly gathering of people in bar area and prepare for an epic taste experience!",1
5,"I've been to Dishoom both times I've visited London, and I can safely say that it's best Indian food I've ever had. No hyperbole in that statement - really and truly I've never had anything that comes close to their dishes.
The experience began with a worthwhile 1-hour (if not longer) wait, and at this particular location, their staff served chai and sherry for the guests waiting in line. That type of hospitality translated its way into every aspect of the dining. Before you're seated, you'll probably order a drink, and I highly recommend the Colaba Colada - pineapple and coconut-cream classic with a Bombay twist: a little coriander, chai syrup, lime juice and dark rum. 
When we were seated after just under an hour, we dove head first into the menu and ordered an array of items:
-Dishoom calamari: a take on classic calamari, perfectly crispy with some delicious Indian spices
-Dishoom chicken tikka: their version of tikka masala but in a spicy marinade as opposed to a thick sauce; perfectly hot and packed with flavor
-Sheekh kabab: spicy lamb kebabs that were out of this world, especially with their raita.
-House black daal: paired really well with the basmati rice and the plain naan
When I tell you that every single item I had was perfect, I'm not exaggerating. I wish they came across the pond to Boston because it's going to be an expensive commute for me to fly to London when I'm craving authentic, unparalleled Indian food.",1
5,"Delicious, beautiful, trendy, and reasonably-priced. No wonder this chain is so popular and opening everywhere! 
Walked in by myself around 6pm and was told there is a 30-minute wait. No problem, went to the bar and got their namesake IPA. Pretty good beer, as expected. The bartenders are friendly and cute, gave me some good recommendation for drinks and where to go. Before I knew it, my table was ready. 
I got fried okra, chicken ruby, basmati rice and garlic naan. Everything was fantastic. Everything. I had too much food so I shared my okra with my neighbors and made friends :) 
Dishoom is awesome, now go line up!",1
5,"This place is amazing. I loved every single dish I got here, we ended up ordering 3 more dishes. The mango lassi was super good too! We ordered the garlic naan, the yogurt (raita), Black daal, chicken biryani, chicken tikka, vegetable samosas, and last but not least the chicken ruby. Seriously everything here was sooo good. I would definitely recommend the garlic naan and chicken ruby! Order the rice on the side and you're good to go. I already miss this place!",1
5,"Dishoom is without a doubt the best Indian food I've ever had! Decided to go here for lunch with a friend who had recommended it. I'd heard how good it was, but I'd never been.
The atmosphere is meant to invoke the feeling of being in a Bombay café from the 60s. And they've got it spot on. 
You have to get to Dishoom early if you want any chance of getting seated relatively soon after you arrive. We waited about 15 minutes before we got a table. We arrived around 1pm. 
The server suggested having a chai, which was the most delicious chai I've ever had. It's also bottomless, which is great. 
After my friend and I perused the menu, we decided on the lamb biryani, black dhaal, chicken tikka, some rice, and garlic naan. It was all SO delicious! The food is family-style, so it's easy to get a bunch of dishes to try with someone else!
If you're in London, Dishoom is worth a visit, even if the queue is really long!",1
5,"We planned on eating here to get our London-Indian fill before we even left for our trip. When we arrived to the location, we found a line way out the door and the doorman said the wait to get inside was about an hour and a half and the wait once you were inside was another half hour. My husband looked at me like I was clinically insane when I said we would wait. But we did wait and it did take about 2 hours to get sat down at a table. I tried to order a little too much because we were so hungry at that point, and the waitress reined me back in. When we finally got that food, the wait was all worth it. Best Indian EVER. We got chicken ruby, tikka paneer, and lamb raan bun with naans and rice and holy moly we raved about it the entire trip. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Wait for it, it's worth it.",1
5,"Every time I visit London this is my must have! The breakfast and dinner are both amazing and two completely separate menus.
Breakfast:
What's good
+ Sausage and Egg Naan Roll - what's not to love about this...sausage and a runny egg smeared with cream cheese and chutney wrapped in warm and delicious naan bread. 
+ House Chai - probably THE best chai I've had so far and you get free refills...yes please!
What's meh
- Big Bombay - nothing special here, it's pretty much a typical homestyle breakfast dish just with slightly different flavors. Wasn't wow'd by this dish at all
- Keema per Eedu - this is actually a super savory dish, but the pieces of chicken liver were a bit large and dominating for my taste. If you love chicken liver this is the dish for you.
I'm not going to talk too much in detail about dinner because almost everything we ordered was delicious like:
- House Black Daal
- Lamb chops
- Garlic naan
- Chicken ruby (any curry really)",1
5,"Just blown away from this place. The food was awesome, the drinks were creative, and the service was excellent. We came here for dinner and ended up coming back for breakfast later in the trip. 
We ordered a feast the first night it was hard to recall all of it but we had a few rice dishes, a curry, cheesy bread, naan, fried okra, corn....to start. Those were all spot on! The star was this slow cooked lamb shank with this yogurt sauce that the waiter insisted we try. Hands down the best lamb I've had. Paired it with their in house beer and it just blew our minds. 
Breakfast was equally as impressive. There's just too much to recommend - come and you won't be disappointed.",1
4,"Obviously a great experience. Really enjoyed the food, and excellent environment. The wait time was a little crazy, but the chicken ruby is something I dream about. The black lentils were okay, as were the other little things here and there. The fried okra is also particularly memorable, and popular since it's recommended by a lot of the staff there. 
The sauce of the chicken ruby: perfection. The garlic naan: perfection. The biryanis were tasty, and all of their curries are prepared so well. The restaurant decor is consistent across locations, and offers a nice, upscale but not too in-your-face as it could be so you still feel normal wearing totally casual clothes.",1
5,"I think it's my favorite Indian place in London! It was my second time in Dishoom but first time at their Shoreditch location.
The restaurant is nice, I like the atmosphere. The service is good and fast, good advices and the staff is really friendly.
we ordered different dishes to share: Bhee, vegetable samosas and murgh malai as starters. Then, as main dishes, we ate the lamb biryani, the chicken ruby (a recommendation from the waitress and it was awesome), black dhal and some roomily roti.
Everything was really tasty, full of spices and delicious. We ended up super full as usual !
I finished with a Masala chai, perfect as the rest of the dinner.
I really love this place, the only bad point : the queue to get a table as they don't take reservation for less than 6 people",1
4,"We ordered the chicken tikka, chole poori, roti and kachumber and chaat salad. Our favorites were the chole poori and chicken tikka. The three sauces that came with the chole poori were delicious! The chicken tikka had a nice spicy flavor. Definitely will go back to try other dishes.",1
5,"Great cocktails, lively vibe, great outdoor seating, amazing chili cheese bread, lamb, chicken masala and more. Everything we ordered just hit the spot, alongside the music and drinks!",1
4,"Food was super good. Always very packed unless you go during off peak hours. Was a little pricey, but very delicious. Huge win for Gluten Free foodies as much of the menu is already gluten free!",1
5,"We would eat here every day if we could.  The food is so fresh, flavorful, so delicious it's okay if you're on fire everywhere!
We ate here for breakfast and dinner and there was a line and a wait both times (thankfully our luggage meant something and they found a way to seat us for breakfast before our flight)!
We ate all we could at dinner, the fried okra, the red curry chicken, the cheese naan, calamari, the very necessary yogurt sauce.  The fries.  It was all just the best Indian food ever!
I had my first authentic full English breakfast here and it was enormous and perfect as my last meal in London!  I also saw the only orange eggs here I've ever seen in my life and I bake frequently and have friends that raise chickens for eggs. 
The bottomless chai is also wonderful and really if you've never been to London or had Indian food, please do and eat here!  You'll see why it's the first place everyone else goes too!",1
5,"Exceptionally good modern Indian restaurant. Only negative was the long wait (odd for a Wed night) - although, this is a sign of how popular this place is. Waited about an hour for a seat. They have, however, cracked the mystery of how to provide great customer service in a busy restaurant. From the complimentary chai shots served to those waiting in line to the knowledgable bar and table staff who seemed genuinely passionate about their roles, this is really a stand out place. They also have lots of vegetarian options and you can have a good meal for two plus drinks for around £35. Check it out.",1
5,This was the best Indian food I have ever had. Too bad I had to go all the way to London for it:). Go early or late to avoid the long wait. It's worth it if you have to wait though:).,1
4,"I loved this place. First time I've seen an Indian fusion concept done on a large scale for sit-down restaurants. The restaurant is meant to imitate and maintain ""dying breed of Bombay cafés."" 
From walking in, the decor and set up was very reminiscent of that in India. From the ambiance to the furniture, signs for café rules, and the silverware; the environment was very well considered.
The menu itself had many items that included traditional Indian/Bombay cuisine as well as fusion dishes. I tried the Lamb Raan, which included a sandwich with minced lamb, veges and chutneys; Bombay cole slaw; and salty snacks on the side. The flavor was not the best I've had for Indian, but the execution was very strong and well presented. The Bombay cole slaw was surprisingly good, seeming to be made with masala powder in the standard recipe. The Chaijito (mojito with chai syrup and ginger) was pretty good as well.
The best was the chai at the end, made authentically. Will definitely be returning to try more of the menh when back in London!",1
4,"I liked Dishoom, but I didn't loooove it. 
I love Indian food in general, and this was definitely great, but maybe it was that I'd come with inflated expectations (Dishoom came repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, recommended by everyone I knew), but honestly, I just thought it was good, definitely above average, indian cuisine.
The vibes of the place were great, the chai was tasty, the food was flavorful, but I wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes to eat here. 
Everything I had was great, especially the Murgh Malai. This was definitely a table favorite. I kept seeing recommendations for the black dahl, but I have never been partial to dahl and this dish changed nothing. (If you don't like dahl, don't expect that you will like this, it does taste just like dahl.) 
Food was delicious! But again, I didn't think this was mind-blowing in any respect, and I don't think I really was exposed to any flavors I hadn't previously experienced at other good Indian restaurants. It certainly is worth trying, but it isn't worth a long wait.",1
5,"Omg I love this restaurant! Some of The best I've had in London. We ordered just about everything on the menu and everything was tasty!!! Definitely go with whatever the server suggests and try and much as you can! If you can't handle spicy food, then maybe Indian food is just not for you. ‍",1
5,"The best Indian food l've ever had in a clean and contemporary restaurant!!
Would suggest doing family style if, as the plated could be easily shared.",1
5,"Came in for lunch, same menu as dinner but shorter queue. They stop takeout orders after 5pm.
Okra fries, crisp spiced bites, had to fight off my husband for them
Lime lamb chops, I felt they were over charred but my husband really enjoyed them. Sprinkles of pomegranate seed adds visuals 
Chicken ruby was highlight for me, rich creamy curry with tender chicken pieces...scoop with Bhatura (puffy fried bread) and enjoy 
Black daal, hard to describe to flavor but good, thick black lentil soup. 
Hip vibe and super friendly serve. Outside veranda seating available.
(Written by husband)",1
5,"This is one of my favorite spots to eat in London and apparently a lot of others too. They don't take reservations so you will have to wait in line to be seated. Even on weeknights the wait can be around 1 hour at peak time (7-8pm). I suggest going early (6pm) or late (9:30pm) if you prefer a shorter wait.
First stop is the bar. They make delicious cocktails. 
Once seated you can't go wrong. We ordered the chicken tikka, masala prawns, lamb biryani, chicken ruby, black house daal, bowl of greens and garlic naan. All delicious but my favorite was the lamb biryani. I wish we had ordered two orders of naan instead of one to dip in the sauces.
Great meal! Can't miss if you are in London.",1
4,"Come here for the food!! Amazing authentic Indian food - service and cocktails were not the highlights. We arrived slightly early and headed to the bar. My boyfriend got a Dishoom IPA which was delish - I ordered a bellini cocktail which was crazily sweet.
We were led to our table on the outside patio (fully enclosed - except for the sliding doors which weren't working properly on this particular night = winter cold draft). 
Service was slow - and my boyfriends glass of wine was served with a massive crusty food fingerprint smudge. Dishes we ordered were forgotten on both our table and the table next to us - the servers had to be reminded and finally came out at the end of our meal. 
That said, the food itself was AMAZING!!!
- Black dal - Traditional style, smooth and delicious. Watch out for all the butter in this bad boy!
- Lamb Raan - My boyfriend lived in India for two years and LOVES this dish - the most amazing succulent, slow marinated and tandoor cooked leg of lamb. It falls off the bone!
- Chicken ruby - Classic English style curry.
- Chicken Tikka skewer - Succulent chunks of chicken perfectly cooked in the tandoor
- Rumali roti - Thin bread that unfolds like a giant napkin - much less filling than naan.
- Garlic naan - The classic for dipping into a curry
There are three locations in London, but the Shoreditch one seems to be the most popular. This is a must visit for Indian food lovers.",1
3,"I've never been excited by Dishoom. Maybe I've ordered badly, or been in a mood. But I've always heard great things about the bacon naan so I was pleased we were in town early enough on a weekend. 
We were quickly seated in the busy restaurant and our order taken relatively quickly. Drinks came as expected. Then we waited. And waited. And more waiting. Outer waitress never came back to our table. 
My bacon naan was tremendous. Loved it. But waiting for 45 minutes beforehand? Not cool. Paying was also time consuming. 
I'm still not excited by Dishoom.",-1
5,"This is easily the best Indian food I have ever had.  I cannot even fathom what it would take to make me think otherwise.
We had a group of six including two non-endian food eaters who had been converted by the end.  Our host ordered for us and between the paneer, chicken tikka, dosa and sauces we were excited by every bite.  The Naan was perfectly cooked and they paid great attention to the authenticity.
The cocktails were out of this world.  Each one was exceptionally balanced, well thought out and perfect for the evening.  Their bar staff had a lot of fun making the cocktails and you could tell with the theming and concepts behind them.  I highly recommend trying as many as possible.
If anyone from Dishoom reads this, please open a location in Washington D.C., it is going to get very expensive for me to fly to London every time I am craving Indian Food.",1
5,"Oh the joy this place has brought me. Starters Okra fries dipped in magical batter and fried, Maatar paneer and Ruby Chicken, spiced lamb chops (amazing), rice raita and garlic naan. My stomach is so grateful for this meal of lovely perfection. Incredible service, efficient, attentive, timely. Add that with a great ambiance and beautiful decor. Dishroom has truly mastered creating a brand that is sure to carry on Long success.",1
5,"This place is beautiful and the food, while not the best Anglo-Indian I've ever had, was still amazing. 
I had come in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon back in December. Even though I was only dining by myself, I still had to wait about 20 minutes or so before a table was available for me. I sat in the adjacent sun room, of sorts, that is just outside the main entrance of the restaurant.
 
Once seated, I ordered the bhel puri appetizer to start, and then the paneer tikka with rice and garlic naan on the side (because, ya know, you can never have too many carbs). The bhel puri was pretty good and the paneer was just as I imagined it would be: a little dry but rubbed nicely with the tikka masala mixture. Portions were large and the service was quite good. As weird it sounds also, the bathrooms were also nice, and I liked their old-fashioned toilet tanks and wooden seats.
 
You can certainly get much cheaper Indian food in the area, but I think this place is worth a visit if you're looking for a more posh dining experience.",1
5,"My husband and I have decided that Dishoom is probably one of our top two Indian food restaurants. I've had Indian food in LA, NY, DC, Virginia, Tanzania, every gosh-darn place I've lived (unfortunately India is not on that list) and still Dishoom is  a top two in my life. First, the ambience is really elegant and comfortable (except for the privileged jerk who was seated next to our table who treated the servers in an incorrigible way). Despite having to deal with the prick, the staff was gracious and patient. 
Like what many reviewers say, this place has an hour long (or more) line but they gave us chai tea for free as we waited. We ordered their signature dishes: lamb raan, black dahl. No words can describe the flavors experiences from the lamb tan. It was exquisite. As for the black dahl, my husband threatened to become a vegetarian if he could have this dish every day, and the man is a tried and true carnivore! I've never been to a place where the side dish was actually the centerpiece of our meal. We couldn't have enough of it! Great Indian food and if you're a visitor in London looking to experience the best Indian food there, like we were, look no further.",1
5,"If you wanna get in without having to wait, come right before they switch from the breakfast menu to the lunch menu. We came at around 11:30am and we're promptly seated to enjoy one of the best lunches I've had during my trip to London.
My two friends and I ordered so much food, the waiter was questioning our judgement. Even though he was right and we tapped out with a good amount left, he also gave us a bowl of raita on the house. So... essentially he added to our pile of food.
Everything is amazing so you can't go wrong with anything you order. I personally got the chicken ruby, garlic naan, and pau bhaji. Everyone raves about the chicken ruby and I also wanted a curry type dish to dip my naan in, but the true star of everything I ordered was the pau bhaji. A curry is a curry but the pau bhaji I haven't had anywhere else.
My friends got the chicken biryani, lamb samosas, cheese naan, cucumber salad, house black daal, chili and cheese toast, and paneer tikka. One of my friends also ordered the house chai which was delicious and has free refills! 
Needless to say, this place is worth the hype. I had incredibly high expectations and it met them. The service was also excellent with the free raita and our server kept our waters constantly refilled.",1
5,"I am a NYC foodie on ""holiday"" in London 
Went here with my son on recommendation by a friend in NYC we ordered many dishes to try and share... loved all of it especially the mattar paneer and samosas 
Tried the Gola ice dessert and was pleasantly surprised 
We are definitely returning to this place when we return to London 
Also love the fact that is located in Shoreditch!",1
5,"It's no wonder this place was packed with a 30 minute queue at weekday lunch. Thankfully we found seating at the bar and were able to order off the full menu. 
Service was fast and friendly. They have it down to a science but the only theory you need to know is that they make amazing, mouth watering food.
Starting with the fried okra that was well seasoned along with three dipping sauces. Then came the heavy hitters of spicy chicken tikka masala, perfectly baked garlic naan and lamb biryani. The biryani was served in a clay pot sealed with dough to lock in the warm goodness. Tender chunks of lamb accompanied the beautiful coloured rice. A cool raita helped it all go down.
Let's not forget about their interesting drink menu, featuring traditional Indian drinks or jazzing up classics like their sweet and smooth take on the Old Fashioned. 
Before finishing the meal and seeing the relatively inexpensive bill for a full meal with cocktails, I already proclaimed my desire to return. I can't wait to try more from their tempting kitchen.",1
5,"The wait for this place was quite long and I could see why. Not sure I would wait another 90 minutes for this place, but as a first-timer it was worth it. During the wait, a server was kind enough to be passing out mini chai teas or a type of shot to the people waiting in line. Also, the people waiting to be seated are allowed to go to the bar area first and order a drink, which definitely helps pass the time. I ordered a rose drink, which was a fragrant rosy yogurt drink and a perfect alternative for those who aren't feeling in the mood for alcohol.
The décor was impressively well coordinated -- I'd describe it as a rustic shabby chic, with its quirky lettering on the walls (""no flirting with the cashier, no heavy petting"" -- haha!). 
The food was pretty tasty too. I recommend the chicken tikka, which is one of their family handed down recipes. The chicken's texture was succulent, and so soft that when I dipped it in the sauce they would split in half. The garlic naan was also very good; it came with its own yogurt based sauce but I chose to dip it instead in the trio of three sauces that are offered to every table, since they were the more flavor packed alternative. I also got a lamb biryani, which was a combination slow roasted lamb and flavored rice in a pot. It was also good, but the real winners for me were the chicken tikka and the naan.
For dessert, I ordered the chocolate cake with chili ice cream -- quite an odd combination, but they somehow suited each other. As a fan of lighter, and more refreshing dishes though, I preferred the mango kulfi I ordered, which is the Indian version of ice cream on a stick.",1
1,"This place is the definition of hipster. Meaning that although the cuisine is international, unless you are young and trendy looking, don't count on decent service. 
My partner and I were initially seated in the veranda. Mind you, it was 31 degrees outside and their definition of insulation included a few random space heaters.  The veranda was half empty, although there was a long line out the door.  As we didn't feel like eating dinner with our coats and beanies on, we asked to be moved inside. Clearly we should have been more specific, as we were then moved to the loser basement space for those of us apparently not cool enough to be seated in the general restaurant area. Again, we were seated in a subpar, half empty dark area away from the general crowds. This was disappointing, as we were looking forward to enjoying the restaurant experience, including the ambience. I echo the sentiments of other yelpers that although the food is pretty good, the service is too cool for school. If you're not a hipster, expect to be treated poorly.",-1
5,"This is by the best meal I had in London (and maybe life). This is not a drill. I love Indian food, so I couldn't pass up the chance to try out the highly rated Dishoom restaurant. This was my first stop and meal in the area before drinks at Happiness Forgets, so I was super excited to try some of their dishes.
Must Try's:
- Butter-bhutta: next level corn on the cob. Love the chili, butter, lime on top of the grilled corn. I am drooling thinking of this.
- Black House Daal: simmered over 24 hours, there is a reason this is highlighted and outlined on the menu. Pure dopeness. Trust me. Taste the creaminess in it. Tastes like winning the lottery twice.
- Lamb boti kabab: are you serious???? I'm not even a fan of lamb and this was a standout. The meat is smothered with this delicious spice rub that penetrates it all the way to its core. You like boring drab dry meat? This dish is not for you.
- Ruby Chicken: for all you basic Indian food lovers, this is your default chicken tikka masala and it's the best you will ever had
- Bowl of greens: sounds basic, but come on, get your veggie on with some grilled broccoli, snow pea, and spinach dressed in some delicious lime and chili sauce. If you're like me and don't get eating bread or rice (I'm weird, I know), this is your go to side dish.
Also shoutout to the beverage game here. Watermelon drink (non-alcoholic) and the toddy were also friggin mind blowing.",1
5,Minus the long wait to get in it was well worth it. Everything tasted terrific and gulub jamon was the best ive ever had. So happy i went.,1
5,"Favorite spot to eat in London. Be prepared to come to the restaurant right when they open or you can stand in line for hours. Really. If you can make a reservation well in advance I would make certain to do so. Had we known about the wait time we would have done this before traveling here- but we were bound and determined to eat here and someone recommended coming around 9:45 so the chances of 7 of us getting a table would be better. We did, and they were. Our wait was only an hour compared to the three hour wait that we left for the few nights prior. 
The wait IS worth it, however. Every. Single. Dish. Is perfection. Garlic, cheese and original naan all are melt in your mouth incredible. If you really are a lover of Indian food I would recommend ordering every dish off the menu- none will disappoint and the drinks are equally impressive. 
Huge fans.",1
5,"One of the best Indian places I've ever tried  they don't have your typical tikka Marsala but they do have a chicken ruby that is a MUST TRY. Great for one person and doesn't come wth rice so you have to order that separate but I'm salivating at the thought of how delicious the sauce was and how the chicken was perfectly cooked. 
The ambiance is super cozy, feels sort of like a den and it's dimly lit and nice for a date or even a bigger party. I love that they're open about later than a lot of other restaurants in the area. 
The front door was a bit confusing (or maybe I'm directionally challenged) but once we found it, the restaurant was the highlight of my night.",1
2,"Not the best food I had, but, the expectation and the matching decor to the younger casual hip crowds compensate the shortcomings. It's decor is more of French Gastro Pub/Brasserie style. 
The spices are too much and after the half of the meal, all 3 of us lost interest in food, just the black pepper bomb in all 7 dishes and not enough happiness signal reached to the brains. I think we weren't full but done with too much spices of the same kind.
The beer was from London, and, not impressive, the blueberry beer came in a can, felt CHEAP.
The food side was underwhelming in the end. But, our waiter and the beverage waitress are real charmers.
The foul tactic at the entrance door was really not nice. The greeting staff said the waiting is 1 hour 25 minutes, but, if we ordered the drinks inside (at the bar area) the waiting will be shorter. Indeed, whether you order the drinks or not, within 25 minutes, we were seated. And, the exit is on to the main street, and, the arriving guests might never guess but think that the place is fully packed as they see no one comes out through the entrance. That could sell one or two more cocktails or beers, but, that is clearly a deception.
Unique enough to try out, but, I wonder if I would go back to try their food again. But, the deluded people put on their smile all the way. I guess they succeed in casting some good spell.",-1
3,"Food: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Value: 3/5
Arrived 7:30 pm on a Monday and still waited 1.5 hours for a table for 2. Hungry from the wait, we ordered 4 dishes to share. Everything was tasty but nothing was out of the world good. Bill came out to be around 70 quid for 2 people.",-1
4,Great food. Great service. Great management. 4 stars due to a vegetarians unfriendly mistake. But it was addressed and taken care of in the best possible way. If it wasn't for that - 5 STARS,1
5,Literally the best meal I had in London! So good I had a layover for 4 hours at heathrow and we left just to go to dishoom ( another location) anyway I wish we had one in New York because omg this place is amazing.,1
5,"Fantastic Indian food!  The dahl was amazing, the naan hot, the flavors terrific.  I came with a friend we shared about six different small plates, each one better than the next. There was a line to get in, it was worth waiting for. 
 Our waiter was helpful in deciding what we should order and the drink menu was terrific as well.
Will return!!!",1
5,"We definitely went overboard in all the dishes we ordered, but it was gluttony at its finest. As we didn't know what to order, and everything looked delicious, we simply went crazy, but everything we ordered was delicious. This is why these are opened all over London, they're simply that good and really unique. 
I think the prices are pretty reasonable, especially if you don't go totally nuts with what you order. Wines and beers are around £5 and a lot of the dishes are just a few quid. 
The spicy lamb chops were excellent. Definitely a good portion for just £11.90. The House Black Daal was excellent, as were the lamb samosas. Paneer Tikka was tasty too. Really everything was very tasty. Order a bunch of things that look tasty and you won't be disappointed. 
We also really liked how the service was quick and food just comes at you in an avalanche. When we came in there was no wait, but I imagine even if there was a wait it would move quickly.
Dishoom come to America!",1
4,Favorite spot in Shoreditch. Especially great for lunch. The door can have a spotty maitre'd sometimes who doesn't seem to want your business (the only down star) but the food and waiters are absolutely exceptional. I could eat here every week!,1
5,Amazing place and must visit restaurant to satisfy taste buds for Indian food . Very different and refreshing ambience . Cocktails are too good and they serve some of the best Indian appetizers. Vadapav was a surprise . The main course delicacies taste even better than restaurants in India. This place is a perfect combo of a End of the day bar hang out and a dining restaurant,1
5,"Great food, drinks and atmosphere! Try the lamb bun, you won't be disappointed. All the dishes we had were delicious.",1
5,"Best meal we had in London. We went twice in our 5 day trip, that's how amazing this place is. Our favorites were lamb samosas, chicken curry dish, cheese naan and dahl. Don't forget to order a side of yogurt sauce. Just amazing!! Skip the far far appetizer, don't skip desert the chocolate pudding it's to die for.",1
3,"This is my third time coming to this Dishoom location, as I make it my priority to visit any time I am in London because the food is AMAZING, but the reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of the 5 it had in my heart before is because of an experience I had on April 20th. My boyfriend and I arrived around 8:30pm to the restaurant knowing it would most likely be a long wait because of how popular the restaurant is and the time of day, but this was his first time in London and I was determined to have him try one of the best restaurants in the city. We wait for about an hour but we're offered complimentary drinks and able to look at the menu beforehand, so we had no issue with that. 
This is where things went left. When we finally were seated, our waiter asked if we'd been there before and after he hurriedly explained the menu it took him another 20 minutes to take our order (after we flagged him down of course). After we received our food from another waiter we did not see our waiter for the duration of our meal. No refills, no asking if the meal was good and everything was to our liking, nothing. He constantly checked on his other 2 tables and laughed it up with his co-workers. He even reached over our table to give his co-worker a receipt but didn't address us at all. It wasn't until we asked another waiter to get a manager so we could explain the situation. that he finally came to the table, but this time...only to clear our plates. He still said nothing. The manager had to check us out and offered a free dessert for the problem, but it was not about a free dessert, as we declined. It was about the blatant disrespect and overt dislike for people of color from this waiter that we wanted to bring to the manager of the establishment. It's an Indian restaurant for goodness sake. Do not hire people who clearly are not willing to serve everyone.",-1
4,"Is this place cheap? No... not at all!
But when it comes to a decent Indian food night, dishoom is definitely the top choice!
From the cocktails to just the quality of food, you can't fault anything (besides the price so get your wallets ready)!
Personally I thought for the price i expected even better but none the less it's a restaurant I'd come back to!",1
5,"Back to our favorite Dishoom location for an early dinner in the outside area, beautiful, quiet and peaceful. Everything was delicious and we had too much food so we carried out leftovers. It's crowded here -- you'll encounter many obstacles on your way from the garden to the downstairs bathrooms -- which is a testament to the enduring popularity of this location near so many alternatives.",1
4,"The wait is long, always, even on sundays. The cocktails are fun but really small in portions. Vibe is good. 
Tried the chicken tikka, prawns and the signature kaali daal with garlic naan. Portions are small so you have to order 2-3 dishes per person. The tikka was great, but the memorable dish was the daal. I think it  was a tomato bisque with black daal. Pure awesome.",1
4,"On a recent trip to England, we asked a local friend for a recommendation for a good, local Indian restaurant. They recommended Dishoom. My fiancee and I are huge fans of Indian food, so we took her recommendation.
First, let's get the ""bad"" out of the way: Dishoom is so popular, and so good, that the wait on a Sunday evening is over an HOUR. Seriously, there's a line out the door and into the street. This is just a symptom of their success. Frankly, they just need to open another location or two. Incidentally, our friend warned us to go early, like 5 pm, if we didn't want to wait too long. We figured that a Sunday night wouldn't be too bad, so we got there around 6. The line was spilling out into the street.
Now on to the ""Good"" (and there is a lot of good... )
We met with the hostess outside, and she got us on the list, and into the line. While on line, a waiter comes through and brings out shots of various things. Sherry on one trip, maybe a chai shooter on the next. It was a nice way to wait in line, and socialize with our fellow diners.
Once you make it to the door, they send you to the bar to wait some more. I think this is part of their business model. The bar is packed tight, with no place to sit, and almost nowhere to stand. Be pushy, or you'll never make it to the bar, and never get a drink. The bartenders are fantastic, and make some beautiful, artful drinks. We had 2 rounds, and that was great.
We finally got a table, in the outside room, which was blissfully quiet. 
The waitstaff was fairly good. Friendly, mostly on top of it. The downside is that, again, being very busy, you can't get a lot of service. We waited ages for refills on water, mostly because they just don't have anyone filling water.
Now, on to the excellent: The food. Fiancee spent months living in India, and she said this was as close as she's had since. We tried an excellent spread of different items, and they were all excellent. I think the Ruby Chicken was my favorite. Everything was spiced well, without being extreme.
The cost was not particularly out of line. We spent a lot, but that was due greatly to the multiple rounds of drinks. I think each dish was priced well.
I want to give Dishoom 5 stars, but for me, the crazy wait on a Sunday evening, both outside and in the bar, knocked off a star. I can't even imagine what a Friday or Saturday night looks like! Another slight knock: We asked the host to call us a cab, and they called us a car that I think was not an official cab. That was a little dicey, but it worked out OK. The driver was nice, anyway.
Given the experience as a whole, I give Dishoom a solid 4 stars. I can see how they have so many 5 star reviews, but it wasn't quite there for us. Really good, but too many people for my taste.",1
1,"This place horrible. I don't understand how people rated it that high. Food was terrible, price was high for the quality and quantity, and ambient is noisy, waiters are not polite. Our waiter left us in the middle of taking orders to do something else. Dishes did not come in the order we asked for. I don't know what to say about food, it is not even close to Indian Irani as they claim for, sambosa was horrible, fried ocra was half salty and dry, fish tikka was horribly grilled, with no taste, needed a lot of hot chutney to take the soapy taste away. I assume they have other branches. This was a complete waste for us visiting London for a week only.  Avoid this place!",-1
4,"Gluttons* of England, Gluttons of Ireland,
Gluttons of every land and clime,
Hearken to my joyful tidings
Of the scrumptious breakfast time!
Dishoom is continuing to expand across the city of London! This Bombay-style café, which started in Covent Garden more than half a decade ago, opened locations in Shoreditch, King's Cross, and Carnaby over the past few years, for a total of 4 restaurants in London! 
Dishoom is modeled after iconic cafés that were established and operated in Bombay (now Mumbai, India) in the mid-to-late 1900s by Zoroastrian merchants from Iran (known throughout the Indian subcontinent as Parsis - literally meaning Persians). It is quite a unique blend of bustling energy and a relaxed, laid back vibe. 
The food at Dishoom would be described as ""non-traditional"" in relation to the food offerings at the multitude of Indian restaurants that operate all over the UK. Breakfast is the best meal with the most typical of Parsi dishes. My personal favorite is the Keema Per Eedu, spiced minced chicken, interspersed with diced chicken liver, and topped with two fried eggs. This protein-rich deliciousness is served with two buttered pau buns. Another favorite of mine is the Akuri, a heap of spiced scrambled eggs also served with pau buns. 
The Kejriwal (fried eggs with chilli cheese toast) and the Bombay omelette are mad tasty, and the fire toast comes with a pineapple-pink-peppercorn jam, which is some of the most delightful combinations of sweet and spicy flavors I have ever experienced. ""Oh man"", declared my taste-buds, ""that pink peppercorn and pineapple is my jam!"" 
The only slight disappointment was the Dishoom slaw. It is supposed to be a creamy coleslaw with pomegranate seeds in it, and there were literally 3 pomegranate seeds in the bowl full of slaw; not even joking! 
In a city like London, where an abundance of exceptional restaurants makes it impossible to pick a favorite, I find myself drawn to one of the Dishoom locations when I have time (and stomach capacity) for only one meal.
 
*Note: I'd much rather call myself a ""glutton"" than a ""foodie""; it just is a more apt description of what people like myself are.",1
5,"Really great breakfast, had a bacon and egg naan roll. It was delicious and blended well with the cilantro and chutney. My only recommendation would be to have the bacon on the side as its taste is somewhat obscured by all the other flavours. Service was prompt and friendly, and prices were pretty reasonable too. I'm a fan and will definitely be back.",1
5,"I'm no expert in Indian food but this was AMAZING. We got:
- vegetable samosas (5/5)
- pau bhaji (5/5)
- chicken ruby (5/5)
- chilli malai pomelo (5/5)
- dishoom chicken tikka roll (4/5) - not a very shareable plate as the rest of them, and I wish they had told us - I also feel it's a lackluster dish compared to the many other better options
- house black daal
- lamb boti kabab (5/5) - they managed to make a 'dry' dish still delicious and flavourful
- gunpowder potatoes (5/5)
- side of basmati rice & garlic naan (5/5)
We also got chaijitos and the viceroy's old-fashioned, both expertly crafted cocktails.
I would highly recommend going to this place! We sat on the veranda and it was very cosy, with great food and great service.",1
4,"Excellent food and fun environment. Nice and spicy. It's good if you have enough cash to buy a bunch of things, some wine, and chai to finish off. The rice was nicely cooked and the service helpful. Some folks in my party thought sitting in the basement was a downer, but it had nice ambience. Sadly, no opium pipes available, as a sign said.",1
2,"Been to dishoom for many yrs and Shoreditch one a few times. Always the worst experience, the service and food quality. The Lamb chops that I always ordered are burnt in this restaurant, turned in totally black and not hot when the dish arrived",-1
5,"Was skeptical about coming here as I was dreading a long wait, but am so glad we decided to try it! The queue outside was long when we arrived, but we were promptly checked in and given warm chais while we stood in line. The line moved fast and we made it inside to the bar area to complete our wait with drinks in hand. We were seated before we knew it. Staff was warm, efficient and helpful throughout. But let's talk about the food! We ordered a lot of it, and all plates and bowls were mopped clean by the end. Ruby chicken curry, chicken tikka, black daal, bowl of greens, naan, roti, rice. The flavors were outstanding- no surprise why this place is so popular. Will definitely return next time we are in London.",1
5,"Indian restaurant in Shoreditch center!
Bombay style interiors and corresponding menu that takes excellent score in everything; friendly staff, tasty food (tried brunch and loved it!), nice prices.
Don't just turn up - the queue is quite long all the time. Instead, book your table through their online system in advance.",1
5,"The food was amazing! The items I tried and recommend:
Okra Fries
Gunpowder Potatoes
Lamb Samosa
Get them all!",1
4,"Great atmosphere. Colonial India feel, I like it. Tbh I'm pretty critical when it comes to eating Indian food when going out but this place served decent chops and black daal. Dhal. Dahl. Daaahl. Wonder what the actual spelling of that word is 
Anyway. Taste was 8/10. Atmosphere was 8.5/10. Good service. 
Oh damn.... I remember I had a old fashion, but the viceroy old fashion (think that was the name???). Yea that was dope. 8/10.",1
5,Best meal  in England--one of my favorite restaurants of all time. Worth a wait. They serve you drinks and chai in line as you wait and you can order drinks and small plates once you get to bar.,1
5,Unbelievable! Best Indian food I've ever had. So many great options and very cool atmosphere. Had a bit of a wait but was totally worth it! Still dreaming of the meal and it's been almost 3 weeks since my visit.,1
5,Lives up to the hype but the service is a little weird. Still you should try to go!! Get in line early and it shouldn't be too bad. Definitely have the lentil dal with the roti- delicious and I think about it all the time.,1
5,"We came to this restruant because of the amazng revews on yelp... it was even better than what they said. The service was great, and the waiter was super helpful, and the food was GREAT! The best dish was the dal by far!!! I highly recommend this place!",1
5,"Excellent food. Excellent venue. A good experience, with amicable staff. Just wait to get served. But try the spicy lamb chops for sure.",1
5,"I went here twice when I was in London previously, this experience was again top-notch.  It has an interesting decor, great service, perfectly cooked food, and an interesting range of flavor profiles on the menu without taking on too much.  
Their cocktails and chai's are also out of this world.  A tiny bit on the pricier side but worth it for all the reasons listed above.",1
5,Food was really good and prices were reasonable. They have a gluten free menu that includes choices of deserts. I went with kids and they all loved the food. Portions are a bit small but then we got to order several different dishes and liked all of them. Service was quick and staff was polite. It is pretty casual and loud so kids were just fine being themselves. They add 12.5% tip to the bill. It seems like a popular place ... we made reservations and on our way out there was a long line of people outside.,1
1,"The food was okay but the appropriation of Parsi culture as a marketing gimmick was unacceptably crass. Imagine a Jewish-themed restaurant, with the walls decorated with menorahs and the wait staff wearing yarmulkes, except that the management and waiters were all, let's say, Chinese. This would undoubtedly cause an international uproar. Just because the Parsi community is almost extinct doesn't make this any more acceptable.",-1
4,"Lovely place. All the dishes were on point. The Mattar paneer was especially delicious. And that epic cheese naan with its perfect chewiness. We rounded out the meal with a lamb biryani and the chicken tikka. 
Service was a bit hectic, but to be fair the place was still totally packed at 14:30.",1
5,"It is the first time we have eaten here and we were impressed
We booked a table for three people ( the third person was on there way) and was told it would be 45 minutes so we had a coffee at the bar. Our table was ready earlier than we had been told and the third person had still not arrived but this was not a problem , unfortunately the third person was stuck in traffic so we ordered. We had chicken berry Britannia,ruby Murray and chole bhatura it was delicious,hot ,flavourful. The staff were excellent very helpful and answered every question we asked about items on the menu. The dishes are small but it was enough for us and slightly overpriced but this is trendy Shoreditch but that said the overall experience was excellent",1
5,"First time here. On a training course in London and thought I'd try it out. Walked over a mile from my hotel as it was a nice mild evening. Got there and loved the vibe of the place but was told there was over an hour wait for a table.
Thought I'd chance as I was already here. Waited about 20 mins in the outside queue and was served a couple of free sherries, nice! Once inside had to wait another 30-40 mins at the bar.
But once I was given a table, let me tell you, it was totally worth it. The food was absolutely delicious. No complaints whatsoever. Ordered a Salted Lassi, Masala Prawns and a Lamb Biryani. Everything was spot on. Would gladly come here again and highly recommend it. Great atmosphere too.",1
2,"Yelp, you really effed me over on this one. Dishoom was by far our most disappointing meal of our 10 day U.K. trip. London is known for their top notch Indian food so I was expecting this place to blow me away. Instead, it just made me homesick. 
I toughed out the 90 min wait because I knew London on a Saturday night would be ridiculously crowded. I hated that we couldn't leave the restaurant while we waited like you often can in the states. They still use the old beeper system, and it took 20 min to get to the hostess stand to get it. We spent the rest of the time in the bar. 
Service in the bar was awful. The waitress got orders from three other parties around us, but we were ignored. We flagged her down when she returned with their orders quite some time later. We snacked on the pau bhaji which was spicy and unique, like Indian sliders. I got some chai to warm up, and that did the trick.
We were seated three different places. First the hostess offered to seat is ""somewhere more quiet"" when a large party took over our area. Apparently, ""somewhere more quiet"" was directly next to the fiery hot kitchen on a high top. No thanks. The third place was just right. 
I got paneer tikka, and my husband got prawns korma, some of our favorites at home. Dishoom's versions were way more expensive and not nearly as good. My husband's prawns were small and didn't come with the creamy sauce we were expecting. My paneer tikka was just pieces of cheese with a slice of bell pepper in between. That's it. Luckily, we did get the black lentils and garlic naan, and those were standouts. 
Anyone going to London, please ignore the high star rating of this place and try somewhere else.",-1
4,"Great service - fast paced environment but very welcoming.
Great for sharing and food is delicious! 
Lots of small plates so you can try loads of different things. 
Very busy - but always accommodating",1
4,"Wow really loved the indian food here and their mango lassi! Their naan was absolutely perfect, and it vanished from the table a few times. If your in the area with your friends this place is a must for dinner... you won't be disappointed!",1
5,This place lives up to its reputation. Everything seemed pretty well priced in an open cool environment. The curries and lamb were all well cooked. The food came pretty fast but it did take a while to clear. I would definitely come here again based on the quality of the chicken tikka alone.,1
5,"Going to London, I was super excited to eat good Indian food. I asked a friend who recently traveled to London where to go and she immediately recommended Dishoom. The restaurant itself is beautiful and in a really great area of London. We originally wanted lunch but we got there during brunch time so we ordered a couple breakfast items and then waited till lunch to order more. For breakfast we ordered the bacon and egg naan roll. It came with this delicious chutney-type sauce that was excellent. It was a really, really awesome dish. The lunch items we got were also delicious!! Best Indian food I've ever had.",1
5,"Great drinks and amazing Indian small plates. We got the bhel, ruby chicken, black daal, and grilled lamb. Everything was FANTASTIC and sufficiently spicy.
Also, be prepared for a wait.",1
5,"We came on a Monday night around 7-8 pm and the line was already out the door. From what I've heard it's like this every night so be prepared to wait. The queue for the bar was about 20 minutes and then the queue for a table was about an hour. It was our last night in London and I realllllly wanted some Indian food so we waited. The staff at the front and inside were very friendly. While we were waiting in the bar queue outside a hostess came around w complimentary drinks of sweet sherry wine, chia tea, and lemon water.. she came around every few minutes which was a really nice touch cus you had something to sip on while you waited. Once we were at a table we started ordering to our hearts delight. We got the veggie and lamb samosas, the ruby chicken, some rice, naan, and a few other things that slip my mind. Everything was well worth the wait. The place does not disappoint. Definitely plan on making a trip back here for their brunch.",1
4,"Hubs and I were visiting London and interested in getting some Indian fare for dinner one thursday evening.  It was fairly late, on a weekday, so we were a little surprised to hear that the wait would be 1.5 hours.  But no matter, we weren't starving and we were on vacation, so thus, not a school night.
Ultimately I think we only waited around 45 minutes, so not bad at all!  Dishoom is so very charming, the decor and everything really sets the tone and mood for what you'll eat.  We tried to think of any chain in the US that comes close to what Dishoom achieves and came up short.  This place is pretty great.
We followed the advice of many reviewers before us and ordered the Ruby Chicken, along with a biryani and prawns.  I had the viceroy's old fashioned which was quite nice.
In short, the food was stellar.  My one comment would be that the biryani was a bit under-seasoned, but still quite delicious.
I almost wish we'd been hungrier!  Then we could have tried more things.  So much yum to be had!",1
4,"I've been to all but one of the different Dishooms, and this is my second favorite in terms of food. But it has the best ambiance and service in my opinion. 
I came for dinner on a Tuesday for a party of 3, no reservation. Started waiting around 6 and got seated a little before 7:30. Wasn't bad, we sat next to the bar and had a few drinks. I got here reasonably early. Line definitely got worse as time went on.
We ordered chicken tikka, the special lamb dish (specific to this dishoom, okay lamb shank...tad dry), daal, naan, chicken ruby (this dishoom makes the best of this) and chicken biryanni.",1
3,"Gimmicky and a little clumsy. Overall - a pleasant brunch experience. 
The seats on the veranda, whilst lovely to look at, are generally either too high or low for the tables, making a lengthy stay uncomfortable. The seating inside is much better, though the restaurant is quite gloomy for a sunny Sunday brunch. 
Despite having ample staff, the service was very slow. Our drinks and food orders were incorrect, though our server was very apologetic and happy to rectify. 
The food was pretty good though, and that is the most important! Inventive and reasonably priced. We came for the brunch menu, and enjoyed our tapas style selection. I also highly recommend the chocolate chai.",-1
5,"I find it hard to take the time to write about beans but the daal here begs for it. I've never had beans prepared in such a way that I wanted a second helping. Don't miss the black daal!
Beyond the unforgettable daal, the entrees and non-alcoholic drinks were outstanding - really loved the virgin bombay colada. We had the chicken ruby (like a curry) which had a wonderful sauce of which we devoured every last drop. The murgh murai and sheekh kabab (lamb) were outstanding, I'm partial to lamb but this time the chicken beat it.
We waited about 45 minutes on a Sunday night after being told the wait was over one hour. We thought that time was a godsend as the Covent Garden location had a 2.5+ wait the night before.",1
5,Hands down the best Indian food I've ever had! our waitress was really nice and gave us great recommendations on what to order and of course we ordered it all! We had more food than either of us could eat but the food was just that good. The walk back to the hotel was hard because we were stuffed and both wanted to take a serious nap.,1
5,The best Dishoom. Take the chicken ruby and order it with basmatic rice. All the lens was delicious,1
5,"Fantastic! The line went faster than estimated and the food was great. I recommend the Okra fries, samosas and calamari as small plates. The Chicken Ruby was excellent as a main plate. I can can see why this place has such great reviews. The atmosphere as on point as well.",1
4,"I lived around the corner from here and dropped in for the first time on a lazy Saturday morning with a local friend. We were seated in the lovely garden like patio which gave you a sense of being somewhere exotic without the corniness. 
Been back many times since. I think it's excellent for all occasions, great vibes. And of course the food and the drinks are always on point.",1
5,"The decor is hilariously colonial but it's kinda cute in an endearing way. The food however, is AMAZING. There was 5 of us and we were able to order a LOT of food which was probably the best way to do it. The okra fingers were so lovely but I think the show stoppers were the daahl and the chicken ruby curry. It was super crowded though and took us a while to get a table, but once we did the food arrived relatively quickly. Honestly, it was so good I'm still dreaming about it.",1
5,This place is fabulous.  Delicious.  Hip.  Did I mention the food is excellent?  Last time I was in the area they were closed for renovation.  Happily this visit they were open and we were treated to an excellent meal.  I will definitely be back!,1
4,"Went for dinner on a Saturday around 10 and only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Very cool interior.  We ordered calamari, okra fries, daal, lamb chops, and naan. Everything was delicious, but I prefer my naan a bit softer and doughy-we, whereas this naan was thinner and crispier. I also had the chai, which was the best of my life. Pricey but definitely recommend and want to go back to try the many flavored laasis!",1
5,"Best Indian I've ever had. The menu had a little bit of everything...the spicy lamb chops were dynamite, but surprisingly, the calamari and okra fries stole the show!
The staff were super friendly, and out waitress offered up a great, inexpensive wine recommendation.",1
4,"This restaurant is extremely popular, had good ambiance, food comes out fast and while waiting for a table they serve complementary drinks. They also have decent prices. However, the food is only decent but not amazing and I had to wait 1.4 hours to sit down, although I could order drinks and apps at the bar after waiting 20 mins. I went on a Wednesday night.",1
5,"DELICIOUS and worth the wait! Came here on a Sunday night around 7PM and waited about 1.5 hrs for a 2 person table inside. The wait isn't so bad - they bring out tasty cups of hot chai and sherry wine to everyone standing in line, then once you reach the front of the restaurant they give you a buzzer and let you order drinks and snacks at the bar until your table is ready. There is a very cute patio with seating, but it seemed like you needed to specify if you wanted to sit out there and/or wait even longer for those tables.
For 2 people we ordered 4 dishes with garlic naan and everything was better than any Indian food I've eaten before, although they are not the dishes you'd expect to see at a more casual Indian food place (they're better). 4 dishes with naan (and no rice) was more than enough food for 2 people. 
The Keema Pau was really tasty - spicy minced lamb with peas and onions that you eat with soft buttery dinner rolls. Then we had the Chicken Ruby Curry - I liked this better than my old standby favorite, Butter Chicken. The curry had a lot of spices in it and they all worked great together. The House Black Daal was my favorite thing that we ordered. It came in a delicious creamy tomato-y sauce. We also had the bowl of greens to get some vegetables in, which was good and interestingly flavored. We had a Bhang Lassi (non-alcoholic) for dessert. This was amazing! The yogurt drink was thinner than I've had at other places, which I preferred, and it came with candied fennel - the whole thing tasted like a candy milkshake (but not too sweet) and was delicious.
The service was great and fast, and I especially loved the decor and the way that the menu explained what the restaurant is all about and how they're trying to recreate the feeling of an old Bombay Cafe in London. It's great to eat at a place that not only serves amazing food but also puts a lot of effort into giving the place a great overall aura and awareness of the culture and history of the place you're eating in. Highly recommend, don't let the wait discourage you!",1
5,"Excellent food. Great service. Had the Dishoom calamari, chicken ruby, awadhi lamb biryani, house black daal, bowl of greens, butter bhutta, and garlic naan. The house black daal was the favorite with the butter bhutta in second (basically it was elote with Indian spices).",1
5,"4 out of 6 dishes were remarkable, best i've had.  1 dish was sort of ordinary (chili cheese toast) nothing special - i'm not even sure why we order it and seems out of place with everything else they have going on, on their menu.  The keema was a little salty and probably my least favorite, its memorable for being the only dish that wasn't outstanding.  The rest of the food was eaten with a chorus of ""OMG!"" after every bite.  Waited an hour, it was well worth the wait. Food came out fast.  Enjoyed conversing with the front door guy.  Great dining experience.",1
4,"The perfect spot for a leisurely get-together with friends over delicious food and addictive chai (seriously, I could drink a gallon of the stuff). Beautiful decor and subtle acoustics means you can have a good old catch up without the echo factor.
So many great food options but my favourite have to be the daal and the naans various - all wonderful and full of flavour. Recommended!",1
5,"Great food, great space. The wait CAN be a bit extreme around peak times, so I would avoid if possible around dinner times, especially on the weekend. Tip: If you don't mind an early-ish dinner, reserve for ""lunch"" at 5:45, and you'll be eating by 6:30 p. This is what my sister and I did, and we were able to avoid the wait time completely.",1
5,Best Indian restaurant in London I've been to for the 10 years I've lived here. It's quite hard to get in as the queue is always massive but totally worth the wait. Black Daahl is just insane.,1
5,This was fantastic. The service was great and menu was really fun. Great cocktails as well. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I was a big fan of the Jackfruit Biryani.,1
5,"Luckily we came on a Monday afternoon at 2pm and it was not crowded at all. We requested to sit in the veranda which was super cute, faint scent of incense that made me feel like I was in an anthropologie store. We shared the prawn kolowada (yummy, could have used some lime), chicken tikka (very nicely seasoned, cooked well, white meat a bit on the dry side) , the mattar paneer (soo good, more satisfying with rice instead of naan IMO), garlic naan is much more satisfying than the roti. The house chai is the most delicious I've ordered in London. we also shared the kala khatta hola ice dessert and unless you really like Asian salted dried plums, you might not enjoy this, not even past the fifth spoonful. I can see why everyone raves about this place!!",1
5,There are several locations but I was told the shoreditch one is the best so we came to meet up with some friends. The line can be quite long. We put our names down and were told that it would be about 60-70 minutes but you can wait by the bar to get a drink. There are a few standing tables by the bar if you can snag one. We probably only waited 35-40 minutes so at least it was overestimated. The food is delicious. You really can't go wrong with anything you get.,1
4,"Good food and great service. Well worth a visit. 
The staff go above and beyond. 
There were a couple of issues when we went but I e-mailed after our visit and all problems were resolved straight away.
Reasonably priced too. 
The interior has an industrial theme and I fell in love with the toilets.
Recommend!",1
5,"London's love for Dishoom runs deep. Apparent from the growing list of accolades that the restaurant has accrued, ranging from customer reviews to the platitudes of food bloggers and critics alike. While the playful yet meticulous décor, the obliging staff and the complimentary 'Chai-Fi' all play a part in generating such a loyal following, the food is ultimately the lynchpin of Dishoom's success. Vibrant, experimental, filling and affordable- it's a rare fusion of these factors. Few restaurants in the capital have such highly recognisable dishes- they are so photogenic that they reappear on foodie Instagram feeds and are retweeted by your brunching acquaintances on Twitter. 
While it's not a quiet success, there's no shame in fighting for a table at Dishoom. The atmosphere is spirited, service is timely and the food is fun and satisfying. Why would you travel further afield for a potentially lacklustre pop-up? 
I made my inaugural visit to the Shoreditch location for a Sunday brunch in February 2016. Immediately, I was impressed by how large and lively the location was. The front of house staff and the servers were warm and congenial- we were seated in an area with plenty of room and our server was patient as we scrutinised the menu. Options range from healthier fare- including a bottomless porridge- to cooked breakfasts and the widely celebrated (and much photographed) naan rolls. There was no real competition: we succumbed to their reputation and ordered one bacon and one egg naan with masala beans on side, a breakfast lassi, a Virgin Mary and a round of Americanos while we waited.
Plenty has been written about Dishoom's naan rolls with earnest reason. And everything you've heard is probably true. Freshly baked naan is pulled from the tandoor oven by an assembly line operation in the open kitchen downstairs, arriving as a springy soft casement- still warm from the oven- for every filling. Amply substantial and a thing of beauty- especially compared to any stodgy white bread variation- this elevates the bacon roll into luxury. The filling is equally laudable: my two eggs oozed with golden yolks, mingled with the hot sweetness of the chili tomato jam, the mild creaminess of soft cheese and the hint of fresh coriander. It arrived with extra tomato chili jam on the side, which I took as an impetus to cast cutlery aside and dig in with my hands (nimble fingers were required to dip small chunks of bread into the small ramekin).
The masala beans also triumphed, evading a sugary and gloopy tomato sauce for a robust, mildly heated and fragrant base. They were delicious paired with the naan roll, especially for those who are ravenous (and we were). The breakfast lassi was a thick blend of oats, yogurt, banana and mango, resulting in a rich smoothie. It coats the throat and is a deliciously fruity liquidised meal that completely lacked the syrupiness of a cheap mango puree-based drink.
Even the coffee hits the right notes at Dishoom, where Malabar coffee is served, made from Arabica beans 'from a single estate in Sunticoppa, Karnataka, are bared on wood to the monsoon winds' (in their own words). It was full-bodied devoid of any bitterness, making it a strong and easy palatable cup.
At under £5.50 for the bacon naan roll (and £4.90 for my two egg roll), Dishoom offers superlative value for a deliciously filling brunch. We left with full bellies, licking our fingers and wondering just why we had waited so long to visit. 
Maybe we subconsciously knew it would be a floodgate for future Sunday trips- better to start now because we have to start making up for lost time somehow.",1
4,"Fantastic food, excellent for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Definitely order the black lentils and the ruby chicken. A bit pricey but well worth it. 4 stars only for service - we were forgotten about multiple times and had to flag down many servers to get our orders in .",1
5,Excellent Modern Indian food. The cocktails were good as well. It is about time they modernized Indian restaurants to accompany good drinks with good food.,1
5,"Paneer tikka on point tho 
And that mango lassi lemme not start
The ambiance and staff were really nice and then neighborhood was cool AF",1
5,"Epic good!!! We had the black daal and okra and a few other dishes. The daal was so deeply flavorful, rich and almost meaty (even though it was vegetarian). My daughter said it was one of the best meals of her life.  Do come early, otherwise you will be in line. We came at about 5:00 
 or maybe a little earlier on a March afternoon and walked right in. Right after that, the line began to form. As Southern Americans we shared our fried okra with an elderly couple from Norway who had never tried okra. That was a sweet memory. And now when I fry Southern fry my okra I use chickpea flour (graham flour) in my batter. When you travel you learn things!",1
2,"My god. What does everyone see in this place? This has got to be some of the worst Indian food I have ever tried.
Not 1, not 2, not 3, but ALL 5 of the dishes we ordered were drier than the Sahara desert. So dry that we had to treasure the extremely stingy (half a shot glass) sauces that came with our starters, so dry that we had to ask for extra sauce that never came, so dry that we had to choke the food down.
Now I can forgive the dry samosas, or even the salty fried okra, but lamb chops are supposed to be juicy and packed with flavour damn it! Also one lamb chop on my plate was medium while the other 2 were well done, how does that even happen? Half of it was inedible fat anyway.
The worst I have to say was the paneer tikka. Paneer is supposed to be drenched in sauce not slightly grilled and slightly seasoned. With plain basmati rice, my friends dish practically tasted like nothing. 
On the plus side, the atmosphere is cool and buzzy. And the prices aren't crazy expensive. Well.. maybe they are for the quality of food served.",-1
4,"I haven't yet had a meal here, but went to their bar on a weekend. Great drink menu with exciting selection. Had a few nibbles which were good. Costly all around but can be worth it for the atmosphere.
I'd love to go back for dinner and the place smelled amazing!",1
5,"Wonderful service! Our waiter was extremely helpful and kind. We had vegetable samosas, ruby chicken, garlic naan and white rice and everything was delicious!",1
5,"This restaurant served the best Indian food I have ever had in my life! The lamb raan, raita, black daal, paneer roti, and everything else we ordered was so unbelievable!! I am really going to miss this place. I wish they had it in Los Angeles!",1
2,"I don't get the hype. I guess if you're into average-tasting, overpriced Indian food in a trendy setting with neglectful service, this is your place.
We waited for 1.5 hours for a two-person table on a Wednesday night. We stood outside for a while, but they brought out some warm chai and a sherry shot. Okay, despite the wait, it's s good start -- full of promise. 
We spent the bulk of the waiting period standing around the bar area, where they encourage you to buy drinks and snacks while you wait. (Cha-ching!) Eventually our buzzer vibrated and we were led to a downstairs table. 
They have seating areas upstairs, downstairs, and even in a detached tent. The environment is chic and trendy, but I found the actual substance of the Dishoom experience to be lacking.
Service was awful. No one ever came to refill our waters until I flagged someone down at the end of our meal and I asked for it. And instead of asking if we even wanted dessert, they just left us with a dessert menu, even though all we wanted was the check. After waiting for a while (guess he wasn't too interested in taking our dessert orders either) we had to flag him down again and ask for the check. They automatically add on a 12.5% optional service charge -- perhaps they think that since few people would opt out, they're safe with giving subpar service?
They don't ask about your preferred spice levels. I would have preferred my food to have been spicer. We ordered the black daal, the royal chicken, a garlic naan, and the roti. The servings were so tiny, we contemplated ordering a lamb biryani too but decided against it when we saw it arrive at the table next to us.
More than once, while taking a bite of the chicken curry, I got a cardamom pod, a big slice of ginger, and other chunks of spices in my mouth. If you're going to give me such a small dollop of food, I would at least expect all of it to be edible.
The black daal tasted decent but was nothing special. It actually arrived as a light brown color, was waterier than I expected (for something supposedly stewing for 24 hours), and strongly resembled Mexican refried beans.
The roti was borderline awful. You only get one large piece in an order. It's extremely thin, extremely dry, and kind of crispy. It tastes very plain. You'd be better off mopping your food up with flour tortillas (for less price too). The garlic naan was a similarly paltry portion -- two tiny triangles in the basket. The naan was flat and dense -- unlikely that it was baked in a tandoori oven. 
The best part about this place was the free wifi.",-1
5,"Dishoom was our first stop in London. Went there for dinner around 9pm with out reservations. We waited in a line outside for about 30 minutes, the entire time the staff would bring out cider and cups of chai while we waited. Once we put our name down we went to the bar area and ordered drinks. The Bombay Gimlet is great. The atmosphere and decor is beautiful. For appetizers while waiting for our table we had the Okra Fries and Samosas.. very tasty! The chatni's are phenomenal. For dinner we had the ruby chicken.. absolutely a must to order! The daal was amazing as well as the raitah* yogurt. The cauliflower had so much flavor. Dishoom is one of the best places I've had Indian food at. Definitely one of my favorites. Too bad it's only in London as I'm from California!",1
3,"I've been waiting to go to Dishoom for about two years. I had heard it was expensive and that better Indian food was to be (easily) had for the price. But ... I still wanted to go. A lot. 
When my mom visited - an avid Indian food fan and a girl who grew up on adventure books of the British-era India - I finally had a solid reason to do it.
We tried to avoid busiest times so we could get a seat out in the patio, which is fantastically outfitted to feel like 19th century India with lots of wicker and greenery and brass. We still had to wait about 10 mins but had a cocktail from the bar before heading to our ""seats"".
The downside to the eclectically styled patio is that the seats suck. Like royally. They *look* pretty cool and seem fun but the aren't fun to sit in and even worse to eat a meal from. Low slung and laid waaaay back, we perched awkwardly and uncomfortably on the edge the entire time. Ick.
Then I found out why it's so expensive - it's ""sharing plates"" These extortionately priced menu items can be found masquerading as tapas, and they are designed to get you to order 6-7 to share between 4 people at £10+ a pop. Boo. Plus our party didn't want all of the same things.
So we ended up ordering just what we wanted (4 plates plus I HAD to have some cheesy naan) despite the waiter pushing and pushing to order more, more, more!  Spoiler alert: we had plenty of food. 
Another crappy thing about sharing plates as that the kitchen use it as an excuse to send the food out whenever they damn well please. So my husband's sandwich came out 15 minutes before anything else. Sort of awkward for him to eat while we waited and waited for our food.
So ... add a couple cocktails each to the bill and we easily spent probably £150 or more. Yeesh. 
Nice atmosphere and nice food and glad I went, but certainly not desperate to go back.",-1
5,"This was the best Indian food I've ever eaten. The only complaint I'd make was that my waitress wasn't as attentive as I'd expect. Took so long to bring drinks to the table that the Bellini was flat. 
I would definitely go here again.",1
4,"This place had been on my radar for a while and randomly walking by the Shoreditch location on a Saturday evening around 5:30, I'm still shocked but quite happy that my husband and I decided on an early dinner. Note - we got there suuuuuper early for dinner but there was no wait and we got right in.
The food was fantastic and the service excellent. The big hits were the lamb bun, vegetable biryani, and garlic naan. Also the house chai and the Malai Kulfi are excellent. 
I really like the décor of the place, and this location is quite spacious which is nice.
We left around 6:45 and there was already a line about 20 people deep. So glad we got there early!",1
3,"After all the hype and the excessive and constant queuing at all of Dishoom's venues, I had very high expectations for this restaurant, but it didn't hit the mark for me.
My friend was visiting me from the States and she really wanted to try out Dishoom after reading about it on a blog. Personally I despise waiting in line for anything but she was willing to go early to queue up, so I was sold! She showed up at 6 PM on a Wednesday and they offered her a table immediately, so I guess the lines don't start that early at the Shoreditch location. 
We tried the Okra Fries (spicy, crunchy, tasty), Prawn Koliwada (can you really go wrong with fried shrimp?) the Chicken Ruby, Paneer Tikka, and of course the 'house specialty' Black House Daal. Perhaps it is a red flag when a restaurant's specialty is an Indian basic as daal. It was good, but not mind-blowingly so. The chicken was okay but a bit spicy, and the paneer was hearty but again, missing the expected wow factor. We also ordered lamb kebabs which the waiter forgot to bring, but he was very sweet and apologetic and gave us a free dessert instead, so he made up for his mistake with the Memsahib's Mess.
In all the food was enjoyable, but I just can't understand why people would queue for hours for this place. London is covered in delicious Indian restaurants where you can get far more food for a better price.",-1
5,Crazy delicious food and friendly attentive service. Come early to avoid the crowds as they don't take reservations. Don't miss the black lentils. I found the menu a little difficult to navigate so ask the waiter to take you through it and order to scale. The bespoke IPA is solid.,1
5,"I'll begin with an obligatory complaint about the queues. There will be a long queue on a Friday or Saturday night. Don't complain. It's survival of the fittest here. If you're going as a group, delegate the weak one (whoever gets off work first) to queue!
The atmosphere here is energetic and it's full of young professionals gathered at the bar waiting for their tables so once the host staff hand you your little vibrating black box of joy, feel free to join them you young go-getter, you!
Cocktails here are fairly priced and some quite unique. If I recall correctly I had a chilli martini and it rocked! 
We were seated in just under an hour and the time seemed to fly past so it was no big deal. The food was well worth it and once seated everything arrived very quickly. 
Considering the very obvious trendy atmosphere and decor, I didn't expect too much from the food. I'm by no means an expert but have eaten my fair share of Indian food and prefer to hunt out authentic fare so expected the food here to be a somewhat 'Westernised' version of Indian food both in presentation and taste. This was the case to a lesser extent than I had anticipated and the food was thoroughly enjoyable. It was nice to see some tasty desserts on the menu. Although mostly not of Indian origin, they were delicious nevertheless.
The price was very reasonable and our waiter was the happiest man I've ever met which made the evening even more enjoyable. Service was included (thank you I love you London, making the awkward far less awkward.) 
Would definitely go back again.",1
4,"First of all, if you're coming to Dishoom for dinner (particularly on the weekend), be prepared to wait! Saturdays and Sundays after 7pm, expect an 1hr - 1hr 1/2 wait at a minimum. Luckily, while you wait outside, the wait staff offers complimentary refreshments such as sherry or lemonade, which definitely makes the wait more bearable! Inside, you wait at the bar for additional time during which you can order drinks or starters. 
I started with Pau Bhaji - a mashed veggie mix served with two buttered buns. It was tasty but I wasn't a huge fan of the texture, which was a bit thin for my taste. 
Not long after I finished I was seated at my table, which happened to be downstairs. Unsurprisingly, with a place this busy they try to fit in as many tables as possible, but it certainly didn't feel crammed. I ordered the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and some garlic naan. Despite how busy the place was, the food came rather quickly. 
Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed at first glance! The portion size was small, and was served with a pittance of vegetables. That said, it was absolutely delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The naan wasn't quite as fluffy as I'd have liked, it was a tad over-grilled.
For dessert I had Memsahib's Mess, which includes fresh cream, strawberries, and crushed meringues.  I found the cream to be really heavy in the dessert and would have liked it to have been more whipped as to provide a little more contrast with the crunch of the meringue. 
I'm sure I'll return, but probably with a bigger group. Dishoom is definitely a better place for a group with whom to share and be loud than for an intimate dining experience.",1
5,"The best Indian food I've ever had. And the ambiance is totally hip and cool. Definitely get the Black Daal and Chole Bhatura. So flavorful and comforting. Everything we had was delicious though. We also had the Fish Tikka, Mattar Paneer, and Garlic Naan. I want to come back and try the Fried Okra and Pau Bhaji.
The drink menu is to die for as well. I had the Mango and Fennel Lassi, which was an amazing flavor combination. It was great to have a yogurt drink to balance out the heat from the hot orange-colored sauce that they bring to your table.
If I lived here, I'd eat here once a week for sure!",1
5,"During my trip to London, my friend took me to this place really raving about it. I don't enjoy eating Indian food outside very much because it's usually the same everywhere. But this place was pretty exceptional!
We went for dinner time, the line was very long and started from outside the building. Probably waited about 45 minutes to an hour in total. I got a beer from across the street to keep myself occupied while waiting. When you get a little closer to the entrance they offer you some small drinks- and brandy and juice (or lemonadeI forgot what). Once inside (which I had to chug my beer bc they wouldn't let me bring it in, but it's okay because the guy was a good sport about it), you wait more but you can order drinks. Their chai is phenomenal! I got the Bombay Pimms bc I thought it would be fun to try the whole East meets West thing. Anyways, that was good too! Surprisingly strong bc I remember feeling buzzed by the time I was done...
It's pretty dark inside and feels fancy like classic and rich. You would take someone on a date here to really impress them. Where we were seated, we could see them making all the naan, that was exciting for me. My friends and I (4 of us total) ordered probably 6 to 7 dishes and were stuffed after. I freaking adored the paneer naan. Yes you heard me...whatever chicken we ordered was my favorite as well. I found the shrimp to be too spicy for me (but I don't usually do very spicy).
Definitely glad we went here, we had a great meal and were able to just walk to nearby bars to enjoy the rest of our night in Shoreditch!",1
4,Really good Indian fusion. It's an Iranian twist to Bombay styled Indian food. The chicken biryani was really good. We also had shredded lamb fish but would go for lamb chops next time. Very busy so make reservations ahead of time.,1
5,"Thus place is fantastic! We came here for lunch on our last day before heading out to Heathrow...we had our luggage in tow; it was a bit of a haul and we were put on the waiting list (didn't make a reservation) about 45 minutes. My family wanted to ditch and go across the street but I held to my guns and we stuck it out. It only took about 20 minutes because I optioned to sit out in the patio. We ordered the calamari, chicken curry, lamb chops, lamb kebobs, and the grilled shrimp, rice, naan, and the dishoom sauce. We ate everything. There was nothing left. It was a great taste to end our trip in London. Oh yes. And my family thanked me for being stubborn and making them wait it out",1
5,"We visited at 8 pm on a Wednesday night in late July:
A local recommended this Indian restaurant. I checked Trip Advisor and the reviews were great. We read warnings about long wait times. The restaurant does not do reservations and it's true you have to queue to keep your reservation. We arrived to find a long queue. I didn't want to stand in line but the friendly hostess assured us in 30 minutes we would be at the front of the line which means you can then go to the bar and get a digital beeper. While in line, they offered us a variety of complimentary beverages. After 30 minutes, we made it to the front of the line and graduated into the bar. There we enjoyed a few drinks while we waited another 30 minutes for our table.
Once we sat down, our service was prompt and friendly. Our Server, Grace, was super friendly, helpful and prompt. She strongly recommended the Black Daal. I must say, I'm not a big fan of Daal... But this was simply the best Daal I've ever had and the best dish of the night. We ordered a chicken Ruby dish... Awesome. Not too spicy but with a nice kick. We ordered the lamb Sheesh Kabob... Tasty but slightly dry. And a veggie salad and some roti. Absolutely delicious. The place feels fresh and hip and the atmosphere was young and professional. I can't wait to go back!",1
5,"Party of 4, w adults and 2 children.  We were told 1:15 wait, but they seated us in 40 minutes.  Excellent service throughout our meal.  The waiter was very helpful in picking dishes.
This is by far the best Indian food I have ever had in my life.  Too bad we were on vacation and can't come back.  In fact, if I had the means, I would fly over from the states once per month just to eat at dishoom.  There is a reason the place books up for weeks ahead of time and there was an hour wait on a Monday night!!  Excellent food, 5 star all the way!  Quit reading this and head there NOW!",1
5,"I am from Bombay (not Mumbai, never Mumbai). I had to try out what Dishoom claims to serve--the kind of food you'd get in Irani cafes back home. The menu definitely looked promising: kheema pav, far far, etc. Not everything's in there, but there's enough. I am not a purist anyway.
The drinks on the menu are good. Especially, the chais--regular, chocolate, Baileys, the lot. The lassis are average, I'd say. In terms of food, what stands out is the okra, koliwada prawns, britannia biryani, mattar paneer, spicy lamb chops, & the frankies. It isn't the regular London curry house fare, but it is good. What really surprised me were the desserts: memsahib's mess & malai kulfi were amazing. 
But what most people do go here for is the eclectic decor & the outdoor seating area. Both are worth the premium that you pay for. Good service and a great place to catchup with friends.",1
4,"Dishoom for me is a go-to place more for the ambiance and the menu, which tries to encompass Mumbai food in a booklet.
I got pretty nostalgic looking at the menu, but promise is one thing and delivery another. The food is strictly okay. The over expectation probably added to the disappointment levels. I had the koliwada prawns, naan, chicken and vada pav. Nothing except the vada pav left me dazzled. 
This place does make you love it though. And for someone from Mumbai, it makes you very very nostalgic - the service is super quick, staff is very busy, there's Thums Up Float and Nimbu Paani on the menu, the decor bears some touches of an Irani restaurant. All remind you of home. I am particularly thankful to Dishoom, and I am not being dramatic here, for including Thums Up and Malabar Coffee to their menu *tears of joy*.
Should probably try their Irani food and breakfast spread next time. It's all about second chances.",1
5,"The best Indian food I've ever had. Perfect execution, best menu selections, and dangerously delicious cocktails - watch out. 
Decor, atmosphere, food, service all A+!
Beware of the long lines though. Get here early! They only take reservations of parties of 6 or more after 6p",1
4,"Came here with a big group for dinner. Very cool vibe. I didn't think it was the best Indian food I had ever had, but it was very solid. Keep in mind that it is Persian Indian fusion and not just straight up Indian food. The naan was quite delicious.",1
5,"Breakfast? Yes, breakfast! 
'Til 11am weekdays, and noon on weekends. We made it in just under the wire for Saturday breakfast with friends, and we were absolutely delighted with the offerings. It's not a super extensive list, but they do what they do quite well. 
My pal and I both ordered the egg and bacon naan (served with a wonderful spicy jam) and then the housemade granola + yogurt and fruit to split. We both wished we'd ordered our own granola, as 1. it was fantastic and 2. the portion was a bit small for 5 quid. However, it was tasty. The boys enjoyed the bigger breakfast plates and were also very satisfied. 
Service was swift, friendly and we were seated immediately and prompted for drinks. The bloody mary was very different (in a great way) and all the chai and coffee were well received, despite being served in glass. There's something I can't quite grasp about hot drinks served in glass, but that's how they do it here. 
Highly recommend for breakfast, it's a different spin and one worth trying most definitely. Just don't skimp on that granola, you'll regret it when you try to order more and it's past breakfast-time!",1
4,"This place is a mix of bombay Cafe and hipster chique with hipster staff. 
I have been here many times for breakfast and dinner and I can tell that the experiences are different.
Breakfast:
It wasn't crowded so the staff was quick and friendly. The atmosphere in the morning is nice. We ordered the famous bacon naan roll and sausage naan roll and they are really good! Everytime when I am in London I have to eat breakfast here. 
Dinner:
The evenings are always crowded and however the staff is still friendly, it takes more time to order. Or to get the right plates. Instead of the starters they gave us the main dishes first...the food was OK, not the best. This is good for people who are crying when they eat spicy food. Although I am crying sometimes I prefer spices. 
Overall I am a fan of Dishoom, because the trendy atmosphere, the breakfast and the affordable prices.",1
5,"By far, my favorite food I ate in all the places I traveled to it Europe. EAT HERE! First, the environment is super cozy and dim lit. Secondly, the service was outstanding. Our waiter helped us with our choices. I'm glad he did because wow! The food was terrific. We had naan and the black house daal! Best Indian food I've had, hands down. I wish I lived closer so I could enjoy it more.",1
5,"Best Indian food outside India. What else do i say.
I was in London for a week and ate breakfast 4 times and dinner 4 times. Dishoom is inspired by Irani cafes in Bombay. Walk in and you will feel like you are in India. The wait is pretty long. If you go after 7 expect to wait in line for about 30 minutes and then maybe another 30 at the bar area. I would recommend going early. 
Breakfast: 
- Bottomless chai , must have. This is just like I would make it at home. Soothing and a great start to the morning. 
- Akuri : Delicious indian scrambled eggs with indian bread
- Bombay omelette : Fluffy and has a great
- Chilli cheese toast with eggs : ZOMG this is the best and takes me back to my life in bombay. Cooked to perfection 
Dinner
- Ruby chicken : this is butter chicken , almost as good as eating in india '
- Naan : Perfect naan actually cooked in a tandoor, thin flaky , heavenly
- Chicken biriyani : Parsi style biriyani from Bombay. Made to perfection with marinated chicken spiced with pepper perfectly. 
Drinks 
- thumbs up flip : Thumbs up is Indian coca-cola. This drink is served with egg whites and whiskey 
- Chai : anytime of the day 
Desert: 
- Kulfi : average
- Memsahibs mess : this is strawberries , merengue and cream muddled to perfection.",1
5,Graet place. Great service. Great food. Be sure to reserves place before you arrive. The lamb dish is So yamni.,1
4,"I came to Dishoom with a group of 11 people and can honestly say that I would love to go back pretty soon. 
Firstly, as our group was for 10 I telephoned three weeks in advance to make a booking. The only time slot they could give us was 5:45 which wasn't ideal but, given the popularity of this restaurant, I took. 
The staff were all very pleasant and helpful on the phone, and when I called a week or two before our reservation to ask if they can add one extra person onto the booking, I was nicely amazed that this wasn't a problem at all and done straight away by a chirpy sounding lady on the other end of the phone. 
When we arrived we were quickly seated, skipping the big queue outside. Kind of felt like VIP, actually. Perhaps the waiters came over a little too quickly to take orders as we felt a bit rushed to decide and order. 
The food came out in a good amount of time and I found mine delicious! None of that stodgy Indian food you usually get in other places, this food was light. The portion sizes are smaller than you would expect but it was enough to make me nicely full without giving me tut opportunity to overeat. 
Unfortunately not everyone else in our group felt the same and some ended up ordering a second thing to fill the gap. One person did comment that apparently they could taste that the meat was cooked separately to the sauce and added after, which I personally thought was nit-picking but oh well. 
The food is quite pricey for the portion sizes you get which I feel lets this place down. In terms of value for money, I guess it's lacking but it's pretty obvious that this is a place you wouldn't come to if you're on a tight budget.",1
5,Large vibrant space with warm atmosphere in homey setting. Speakeasy style with period music playing. Good menu for sharing or for left overs. Decent prices. Quality food - all was good. Spicy. There are vegan/veg/dairy free menus all on request. Hidden in an alley around the corner from the  main street near by. Open late - came late at 10:30pm and avoided the wait. Friendly staff. Good cocktail menu and nice beer. Seems it would be good for large groups as well as couples. Low light.,1
3,"I would love to have been able to give this 5 stars, but the service was poor enough to bring it down to 3 stars.  (and I'm really generous with customer service, check my other reviews if you don't believe me!)
We had the lamb and the black lentils.  The black lentils were incredible!  Honestly, I think they were the best Indian dish I have ever had.  
Just a note to americans, rice isn't included with the dishes.  Be sure to order it or naan.
Its worth going to, but brace yourself to be treated poorly by the staff.",-1
3,"I have mixed feelings regarding Dishoom.
 On the one hand, the food is really good and I like the somewhat non-traditional approach to the Indian cuisine. In addition, I really like the decoration and the atmosphere which really remind me of a colonial comptoir. The terrace is also nice, but some of the tables are not convenient when you are trying to eat something.
However, I am really appalled by the lackadaisical service. First of all, one either has to come at an ungodly hour (i.e. 4-5 pm) or take the risk of having to wait in a queue for 1h30. Seriously, either they could raise the prices or allow people to book in advance. The personal, while polite, stand out by their lack of enthusiasm (and I have been there 3 times). 
I would still recommend the go if only once to try their Chicken Berry Britannia and the Lamb Botti Kabbab paired with a Lassi, they are all really good.",-1
5,"Last Sunday a friend and I went to Columbia road flower market. We were up and out early doors to make the most of the sunshine and were planning to get breakfast there as I've seen some reviews saying there are some great cafes. I didn't spot anything I fancied (did have a great freshly squeezed juice!) and knew dishoom was nearby so we wandered back that way hoping there would be a table.
I've been to dishoom before - twice in Leicester Square and once in Shoreditch and allll for dinner - boy can I recommend the paneer curry, their rotis and naans and to finish of a kulfi! But I really love the Shoreditch branch and have been dying to come for breakfast
It was actually quite empty on a Sunday at 11 but I guess as they don't take bookings that could be why? Also the place is massive with lots of seating upstairs and down. My fav part though is they have a conservatory type area with sofas where they open the roof when it's sunny. This area was pretty busy but i was desperate to sit out there so we waited ten minutes for another couple to leave!
Right now for the food - wow! I can't wait to go back already. I was lucky my friend agreed to get a few things and share everything. So I started off insisting we got the famous naan roll (I've seen it in so many mags and websites featured as one of the best brunch/ breakfast items), my friend chose the granola and then we decided to get the maksa bun to go with the chai we had ordered. What we didn't realise is that the maksa came with a chai. This came first so we were happily dipping the toasted buttery bread in chai while waiting for the rest. Would recommend but won't  be getting again - just a one time thing for me!
Wow was the naan good! Cream cheese, crispy bacon and chilli jam in one of their delish naans served warm obvs. I'll def be getting this again and I also saw someone else with a sausage and egg naan which looked really good! 
We finished on the home made granola which was full of tasty nuts with their vanilla yoghurt and fresh fruit. Lovely way to finish and utterly stuffed!
This is a definite recommend for both dinner and breakfast and I can't wait to come again! I want my bf to have the big bombay so I can try it all and also fancy the look of the Akuri (scrambled eggs) with a side of masala beans!",1
5,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS AND WONDERING IF YOU SHOULD WAIT IN LINE, WAIT IN LINE!!
Y'all. It's a serious wait. Ours was at least 40 minutes outside followed by another ~20 at the bar. I can't lie that that's a long time. But it is SO worth it. We got there around 8:30 and were leaving the joint at 10:30.
Things not to miss: 
black daal: eat it with a spoon, sop it up with naan, baste it on everything. I don't care.
chicken tikka: so tender, so juicy.
toddy tapper: this drink was lit on fire. I repeat: lit on FIRE.",1
5,"One of my favourites to visit when in London and in need of good Indian flavours. 
The menu is more street food than curries but everything has such great spices that you can't complain. 
Like others have said, I would eat there every day if I could!
To avoid the queues I suggest getting there right on 5:30 and choose a weeknight it's only slightly less busy.",1
4,"Dishoom should be a must-go list for those that like Indian.  Though expect a wait.  We discovered it at 9pm on a Friday after touring Brick Lane, and the place was packed.  Were told it would be about an hour wait.  But, they have a very efficient system to handle the masses.  We were given a beeper to alert us when our table was ready and directed to the bar.  While queuing for the beeper they offered complimentary port and lemonade.  The bar was making up wonderful concoctions and they offered us free okra fries and prawn crackers to pass the time.  (Even if they don't offer the fries to you when you go - you should order these - spicy and good!)
Atmosphere is warm with a moder asian flair divided into several different rooms to give wherever you sit a greater sense of intimacy.  There's a downstairs dining room as well, but I'd shoot for the main floor if you can get it.  
Food: Exceptionally good. Just the right amount of spice.  Shared the ""Bowl of greens"", a chicken curry, rice and samosa.  All were fabulous - and totally a great value.
Bottom Line: Great food, great service, great value and great atmosphere.  Now, if it was just a better kept secret so the wait wasn't so long to get in.",1
3,"I'm REALLY RUBBISH at going to those 'in places' y'know. The more I'm told to do something, the less likely I probably am to...actually do it. Like watching Breaking Bad. But, at the end of the year, I finally got around to visiting.
We managed to get a table within about ten of arriving at around 2.30 on a Sunday afternonn - a far cry from the mega-queues I'd expected. Which was a good thing. I went for the Chef's Special of the Lamb Raan Bun. Slow cooked pulled lamb with dishoom slaw and crisp-chips (basically, supersuper thin little chips which were definitely more crisps than chips - but really tasty and well seasoned). The lamb itself was an absolute joy - falling apart in my mouth, and great with one of the spicy chutneys that they brought out too.
Unfortunately, despite the food being excellent, I felt pretty disappointed with the service. We were seated in the small, covered side area and were often left waiting for long periods when we were ready to order/for the bill/needed something. Our food came out at completely seperate times, and I was given the wrong ice cream at the end.
If Dishoom's service matched up to its food quality then it's be close to a five star score from me, but unfortunately I felt slightly 'shafted' with our seating which dampened the experience slightly.",-1
5,"More than likely you'll have a wait. They say it's an hour but generally it's a lot less. EVEN if it was an hour wait, I WOULD wait. This restaurant is absolutely amazing. By. Far. My. Favorite. I live in the US but if I ever visit Europe again, no matter where I go, I will have to stop in London just to come to this restaurant. IT. IS. THAT. DELICIOUS. I have never had Indian food. But this place definitely put a huge standard for me. We had lamb, naan, chicken, potatoes. I mean everything was pure magnificent. Our waitress was such a doll. Everything from standing in line, waiting at the bar and being seated was perfection.  As anyone who enjoys going out to dinner knows that doesn't always if ever happen, but this place absolutely gets an A+ for everything.",1
5,"Bacon and egg naan and bottomless chai for breakfast?? Erm, YES please. Amazing. The food was so good we actually asked for the menu back to order more (but filled up on chai instead). 
I have tried to come here on an evening but the queue is just too long for me...I get hangry pretty quickly. So breakfast seemed like a great solution: no queue, calm and relaxing, and bacon and egg in a naan. 
I will definitely be coming back (probably armed with snacks to keep my hanger at bay while I wait in the queue for a table) so I can try their dinner menu!",1
4,"A little torn between a 4 and a 5 for this one! The thing is, the great dishes Dishoom serves are GREAT, but as a pescetarian, my options are a bit more limited. I've particularly loved the black daal, the bowl of greens, the naan, and the matar paneer (paneer curry, basically), with the matar paneer being one of my favourite dishes in all of London. The cocktails are always interesting, and the beer selection is pretty good. The atmosphere is great, and the staff are always lovely and friendly.
It's the starters that let the restaurant down a bit. I didn't really like the calamari or the samosas, among others. I thought it was great that the desserts are more interesting, but it can veer to the too strange spectrum.
All that said, I always recommend Dishoom to visitors and residents of London alike. Worth at least a couple of visits!",1
5,"Oh Dishoom. 
How I do love thee. 
This is the type of place where you want to lick the plates clean. Where you purposely order too much food so you can take some home for later (if you can stop yourself from gobbling it all down that is). A benchmark for not just other Indian restaurants, but almost all other restaurants against. 
Consistently amazing. Sure the no reservations thing can be a pain, but take that in stride and go on less busy times (when you'll only have to wait 30 min instead of 2 hours). Go to the bar, have a drink or 3, and ogle the awesome decor. It's seriously gorgeous. 
And the food. I cannot get over it. The daal is maybe even better warmed up the next day. I don't care that it's vegetarian. It's made from dreams. Also the greens with chilli and lime. And the naan. And all of it.",1
5,"This is a fantastic restaurant and bar which offers great meal and drink options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
It is the ""go-to"" please for Indian in East London but make sure you get there early in the evening to get a table as it's super busy and popular most nights of the week!",1
5,Nothing to complain about here. Except that it's hard to get a table! But what can you expect from a top notch restaurant that does everything right. Enjoy.,1
3,"Luck was in our favour when we visited Dishoom and we were told it would be just a 15 minute wait and that we could order some drinks at the bar while we waited. Our drinks hadn't even been made by the time we were whisked away to the front section of the restaurant which was more like a cosy living room (complete with Christmas tree) than the rest of the restaurant which was more formal. I was very surprised that we were given two sofas with a coffee style table to sit at for just the two of us as they could easily have fit four people on it.
We'd originally planned to get brunch but were too late so instead had to choose from the all day menu instead. The choices are pretty varied but since I couldn't have my original choice of their famous breakfast naan rolls I decided to recreate something similar with chicken tikka and a cheese naan which sadly wasn't anything to write home about.
My dining companions's meal arrived fairly quickly but it took far too long for mine to come out after it to the point that her food was starting to get cold from waiting. In fact the service was really poor overall, I had already almost finished my drink by the time my main course came out and the second one I ordered didn't arrive until after I had finished eating.
I wasn't going to have pudding but I was very intrigued by the Memsahib's Mess which was basically Dishoom's own version of Eton Mess made even more amazing by the addition of rose syrup.
I'm so glad I did as it was divine and made me want to return and give them a second chance given all the many positive things I'd heard about them before going. Maybe I'll check out their new branch in King's Cross instead.",-1
4,"Lovely looking venue, and the best Indian food I have ever had. Booking in advance is essential!
Recently went to Dishoom for a friend's birthday so we were in a relatively large group, so service was a bit slow but I don't think smaller groups will have this problem as other tables were replaced with new customers quite quickly. The food was fantastic and quite while priced. The cocktails on the menu were a bit expensive (London though...), and the chaijito tasted like a regular mojito so maybe go for post-meal drinks in another restaurant/pub in the area. 
The style of the restaurant is influenced by colonial era India and a portion of the bill is used as donation to feed children in India. Definitely will go back on the future!",1
5,"Yes it is hyped and it is busy. But the food is unique and stands apart from the typical naan and Butter Chicken you get at regular Indian restaurants. I would suggest looking past the hype and making a reservation for lunch -- as they are less busy then.
My husband and I have been eating at Dishoom since they had their first branch at Covent Garden. The Shoreditch branch has a more laid back vibe.
The Far Far is a snack that is reminiscent of the fermented rice crackers you get in India. The Black Dhaal is delicious if Dhaal is your thing. The Chicken Berry Britannia is a biryani topped with cranberries that give it a tangy edge. If you like Paneer, do try the Paneer Tikka. If you just want a snack, try the Bhel. If you want silky, soft, roti then get the Roomali Roti. If you can't decide, the Chicken Ruby is a fool proof choice. You might be tempted to lick the bowl. The staff won't notice. #JustSaying
The Chai reminds me of the street Chai you get in India. It tastes the same!
If you have food allergies, ask for the allergy menu where they have marked the possible dishes that you can eat accordingly.",1
5,"Dishoom is a magical place. 
Walking into Dishoom is like walking into a different world. You're not in London anymore. My senses were filled with slow, jazzy, and romantic music combined and the smell of burning incense. 
Pros:
- Each table feels intimate and private. For the smaller tables, there are high panels that separate them. 
- free and fast wifi 
- bottomless chai for 2.5 pounds 
What I got and what I thought:
I ordered the garlic naan, mattar paneer, and chai. Everything was delicious. The chai reminded me of my trip to India. However, the mattar paneer was more lukewarm than piping hot. 
*Tip: DO NOT COME HERE FOR DINNER. Wait time is usually 1-3 hours. Come BEFORE 5pm.*
Dishoom is a wonderful dining experience, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants good Indian food.",1
5,"Zomg amazing breakfasts. Expensive but on expense account so, fine :) we ended up coming here for breakfast 3 times even though there are a ton other interesting places nearby. Tried to even go for dinner too but the wait was 1h45 (wtf?!). Will absolutely go back next time in London. Yummmmmm",1
3,"The wait was ridiculous.  The food was ok.  The atmosphere was weirdly nostalgic over colonial times.  
I had the fried okra.  It was ok.  The sauces were nice.  Also had lamb chops, which were not bad.  The lassi was ok.  The daal soup was the best thing I had, but overall, the quality of the food is unremarkable.",-1
5,"This is the real deal for Indian cuisine. Cafe style restaurant, a small menu, really tasty food, good service, buzzy atmosphere and best of all reasonably priced. 
£25 pp including a bottle of wine, VAT and service. 
My best tip is to get here at geriatric eating time around 5pm to avoid queuing outside for ages.",1
5,"I had an absolutely wonderful time here. We brought a group of 14 people (which ordinarily would be quite chaotic) but we were well fed and watered by the end of our two hours here. I would easily recommend the Chicken Berry Britannia biryani as one of the better biryanis I've ever had, and the raita is worth the extra 3 pound splurge in my opinion. Also make sure to have some of the chai if you can! I would easily recommend this place to friends.",1
4,"When in london, must try indian food as london is known for it. This was a must hit up place before leaving london. I must say the wait is pretty long so if you can go during off hours that would save time if you are on a schedule. As we were waiting we were able to order appetizers at the bar which helped with the wait. 
This place was one of my favorite eats during the trip. We had the bhel which was a little different but good, chole frankie which i thought was tasty, mutter paneer was good, chicken tikka was okay not my favorite as i have had better, and paneer tikka i believe which was good. 
The waiter thought that we needed one more dish but we said we wanted to start with this and if we need additional food we will order later. 
The waiter was great and helpful too. He tried to assist with providing suggestions. Overall a great place and you can tell since people are willing to wait to eat there.",1
4,"Trendy and fun experience. Liked it so much we came one day for lunch and dinner! They have a very cool and casual vibe and the service was super friendly. A great place to enjoy some small plates and drinks with friends. They have two floors but I prefer the upstairs.
The lentils and the lamb samosas.YUM!",1
5,"One of the best Indian Restaurants in London.
Despite the daunting queues to get inside, I keep returning to this place.
Excellent Food - love the Vada Pav, Black Dal and Roomali Roti. Mango Kulfi is also recommend.
The cocktails are also nice - in non-alcholic drinks I would recommend Kala Khatta Sharbat - really refreshing.",1
5,"Of all the Dishoom locations in London, this Shoreditch mainstay was my first and remains my favorite of the bunch. The Indo-Persian joint has great food and cocktails, at fair London prices, but what puts it over the top is the outtasight decor. You'll feel just like you've stepped into some kinda film noir Bollywood set circa mid-1900's. If it's a sunny day in London, and you're lucky enough to grab a seat on the coveted veranda, all the better. The okra fries are a delicious staple, and the black Dahl and lamb bothi kebabs have never disappointed. Dishoom also does breakfast and the naan-based egg sandwiches are out of this world, even the simple yogurt and granola is done with a spectacular Indian twist and sublime attention to detail. Only downside to this joint, is sometimes you'll have to wait in a line, as it's popular. The good news? They'll bring you refreshments whilst waiting, and usually you can hang at the bar, have drinks and snack on ones fries and the lot.",1
4,"Loved the decor, service and overall setup of the place. Had to wait for about an hour to get in - understandable given the popularity of the place. We ordered the Chicken Ruby, Chicken Tikka, Spicy Lamb Chops, Black House Daal and Garlic Naan. Loved the Chicken Ruby and Lamp Chops, though portions were a bit small. Found the Daal on the ok side - not exactly worthy of the hype. Overall a positive experience.",1
5,"Really delicious tapas style Indian food. The venue has dim lighting and little corners a hidden booths to make the place intimate, but comfortable. 
The okra fingers were nice and crispy, the pau bhaji was one of my favorite dishes, it was full of flavour. The paneer tikkam gunpowder potatos, and chicken ruby were also super delicious. 
The least popular at the table was the masala prawns... but I think thats because we were all pretty full by the time they came out! The side of kachumber, rice, and garlic naan all perfectly complimented the dishes.
I highly recommend this place with a group so that you can order more dishes and taste them all! The server was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the dishes. I will defo be back next time I am in town.",1
5,"Surprisingly good choice as a place for lunch. A cross between British Pub food and so-called Indian street food, though there were plenty of standard Indian restaurant food options. The surprise had to do with the creative menu, offering sandwich-like options but with an unusual mix of flavors and ingredients. There were only 2 of us so our ability to sample the menu was limited, but our entrees -- a chick pea salad with nuts, grains, pomegranate, and more, and a grilled chicken 'wrap' along with a shared bowl of the recommended Dahl -- were fabulous. Service was friendly and very responsive. As others have mentioned, this restaurant is very popular. We arrived near the end of the lunch hour (1:30), to a busy restaurant, but were seated quickly.",1
5,"This might be the best meal I have had in London in ten years of visiting. Everything was fantastic: okra fries to start, the chicken ruby, black daal, grilled prawns, lamb chops & garlic naan. I would be surprised if there was anything on this menu that was not very good to excellent. Great location in Shoreditch, fantastic decor and vibe. Great bar upstairs, great service. We (2) showed up at 6:00 pm on a Thursday, waited in the bar for one drink, and by the time we left shortly after 7:00 there was a large lineup. I cannot recommend Dishoom high enough. I'll be back on my next visit.",1
3,"I have eaten here twice for breakfast and once for dinner. Once, I got the Akuri eggs, which were super tasty with just the right amount of spice (not too spicy, not too salty), served with a side of grilled tomato and two little buttered buns (~£7, 4 stars--5 if it had been a little warmer, as it was a bit cold upon being served). The house chai I got with another buttered bun was also quite good--I mean, the chai was excellent (5 stars), though the bun itself was just another buttered bun, and like some other reviewers have said, it wasn't my favorite thing to dip into the chai. Maybe it would be better if the bun had a sprinkling of sugar and cinnamon? Either way, you can get a chai for £2.50 or a chai with a bun for £2.70, so no harm there. Plus, the chai is limitless--which, if you have an attentive server, may be filled without you even asking, but if you get an inattentive one, may never be filled even if you ask three times (both situations happened to me). Either way, for under £10 for a meal in a sit down restaurant (whose ambiance is chic via a distressed style of decor layered with a bit of humor in the signage), it's not too bad, even if the portion on the eggs leaves you a bit unfulfilled (even if you steal some breakfast lassi from your friend--which tastes more like banana than anything else (2.5 stars)).
The second breakfast I had there was the Bombay omelette. I had just had an apple, carrot and ginger juice (~£4, 4.5 stars), so maybe the ginger took away my sense of taste, but I found this omelette to be not only overcooked and therefore dry but quite flavorless save for two bites that had a piece of hot pepper in them (~£7, 1 stars). This dish came with one grilled tomato and ""fire toast"", which is really just thick cut white bread toasted on the grill, which leaves blackened stripes on it, and buttered--3 stars. Along with this dish, I tried some of my co-eater's bacon and egg naan. I will say that, aside from the Akuri I had gotten previously, this was stellar--5 stars for sure. I mean, I don't eat a lot of bacon, as the fat kinda grosses me out, but if you look away while biting into this, you'll taste so many different flavors all at once--the smokiness of the bacon, the sweetness of the chili, the creaminess of the cream cheese, the spice of the chili... It's absolutely wonderful, though for £6.50, realize you get a rather small serving and probably need to order something else if you want a heartier breakfast. (Same portion warning goes with pretty much anything other than the Big Bombay, unless you are the type that typically stays full from a couple of eggs and pieces of bread.) I also tried his Kejriwal (£4.90), which was two eggs served on a piece of toast with a bit of chili and cheese. I thought my bite of this was rather interesting. It had a nice bite to it from both the chili and the (sharp cheddar?) cheese--4 stars.
When I went for dinner we started with a couple of drinks and the pau bhaji (£3.90 for a tapas-like serving). It had a quite nice flavor, says this American, but could have benefited from a bit more veggies in the sauce and at least one more bun for dipping (3.5 stars). My Indian co-eater that night said it also needed more peas in order to be more authentic. As for the mango (and fennel) lassi I was drinking at the time, it was quite sour and was therefore nothing like a lassi I have ever had except one made by my friend once--using a mango that was not ready to be cut in fat-free plain  yogurt. I'm not sure how Dishoom makes their lassis, but at about £4 a glass (not bottomless!), they are not what I would expect--which is sweet and addictive. My Indian co-eater agreed. The bowl of black daal we split over a serving of basmati rice was presumed to be the star, but honestly was pretty blah. I found it smoky, if not a bit burnt, rather than rich and decadent like this buttery lentil dish normally has been for me. Plus, the smoky hid the Indian spice that I love so much. For a girl who dislikes bbq, this was an unhappy choice in spicing (~£5, 2 stars). Given this dish was not the star, there was now an opening--which was filled by our dessert: Memsahib's Mess (£5.20). This dessert was a bit on the small side for its price, but was BIG on flavor. From the super sweetness of the crunchy meringue to the creamy cream to the superb rose undertones, it was absolutely wonderful. Not overly rich, but sweet enough and exotic enough to really stand out--5 stars. 
Bottom line: I think there are some dishes that are excellent and some that are okay and some that are plain poor, and though this ambiance is excellent and prices are in line with the rest of London, the servings of certain items could be improved. Combined with inconsistently good (or poor) service, I think 3 stars is really the perfect description of this place. I would recommend trying it, but giving feedback to your waiter if you are not happy so you can order something else then and there...",-1
5,"Dishoom, literally a stones' throw away from my office in Shoreditch, had long since been a haunt of ours for after work drinks. Somehow over the last year or so, our post-office sessions had taken us to a pub down the road, but I think that had more to do with the arrival of new faces, replacing our favourites who went on to open the new Kings Cross site or moved on to new adventures. That said, the guys are still friendly and all is well, but there is just something that is always welcoming about people recognising you, knowing your tipple of choice, having a bit of banter and showing their appreciation for your interest in their passion for making cocktails.
Recently, I re-kindled my affair with Dishoom, not just once, but twice in a 5 day period. A catch up with an old friend brought us here for dinner and we were not disappointed. Now, we had wanted a quiet one, so debated going here because it can be quite loud with the music and people packing out the bar. My recommendation is that you do not let this put you off, as the terrace area provides the calm if you are not up for the chaos.
This was to be a night of feasts, so we ordered a selection of small plates including chilli cheese toast (cheddar), okra fries (fried, well-seasoned and a great snack) and calamari (tiny tender calamari, but no skimping on the portion size). For my main, it was Masala prawns, served slightly charred with a side of lime. Meaty and tasty. I also had some cheesy nan on the side. Valentina had the Lamb Raan bun which is slow cooked pulled lamb on sourdough bread with a side of Dishoom slaw, sali crisp chips and fried green chillies. The lamb was so delicate, so there is no doubt that this is produced slowly. The combination of all these bits piled individually on the wooden serving board, complement each other so well. Be wary of the green chillies, they are spicy! My overall advice would be to also take a raita if you are opting for non-sauce based dishes, otherwise it will be quite a dry meal. 
For drinks, we started with a refreshing prosecco, followed by a Sicilian white for me (Parva res Catarratto) and a full bodied red from Puglia for Valentina who is Sicilian (Terre di Montelusa Primitivo). Complimentary water is provided which is a great touch.
Dishoom has four sites now, in great locations. What I like is that each has their own specials, this helps retain individuality. There is no chance that this will become some boring chain as the food has bags of personality, the concept is sexy and it has what all restaurateurs covet, a team of good solid folk working there.",1
5,"This was on my list of places I had to try and I'm happy that I did because it was absolutely amazing!
I've seen lines out the door at other Dishoom locations in London but this one in Shoreditch is more chill and in a really interesting kind of tucked away place. There are two areas to sit in and I chose to sit in the garden (it was heated even in the winter). The atmosphere is really comfortable and service is friendly and fast. 
When you go, you must get the cheese toast! It is kind of indescribable but slightly spicy and incredible. I also got the Chicken Ruby, which was really flavorful/creamy.  Their breakfast food looks really amazing as well, and would love to try it next time!",1
5,"All chai is coming strictly without Opium, but you would think otherwise with how good the Indian food is here at Dishoom.  Easily my favorite Indian restaurant in the United Kingdom, Dishoom draws inspiration from Bombay and all its incredible spices and flavors.  There are multiple locations, each with its own uniqueness, but if you're looking for some of the most flavorful bites you'll ever take, Dishoom is the place to go.
I believe it is important to eat family-style, each person ordering a couple of dishes and sharing them.  Get the Lamb Raan Bun and the House Special Pau Bhaji, the former a succulent pulled lamb with spices and special slaw, and the latter a masterpiece of mashed veggies and a pau bun.
In terms of grilled meats and curry, the Dishoom Chicken Tikka is never a bad choice, but I would also consider the Mahi Tikka or the Murgh Malai, both excellently prepared dishes.  If you're into Biryani, I would say to choose between the Chicken Berry Britannia and the Awadhi Lamb, both dependant on whether the choices on mains include chicken or lamb.
Finally, the Breads.  Basmati rice is a given to get for your meal, but the right bread choice will help shape the experience of the meal.  The Roomali Roti is an unleaved stoneground wholemeal, griddled and quite thin, in comparison to the leavened and yeasty, tandoor cooked Naan breads.  Each have distinct tastes, if you're not familiar with Indian breads, but I tend to lean towards the Garlic Naan.
Final word of advice, don't leave without getting the Bombay Pimm's, it is quite possibly the best cocktail on the drink menu, and if you're not careful, you may end up ordering 4 or 5 before it's too late.
Eccentric vibes and atmosphere, and an awesome enclosed patio space makes this place a top rated restaurant.  Add the fact that each dish is appropriately priced, and the case is there for why Dishoom deserves 5 stars.",1
4,"Yup yup, this place is all sorts of solid and delish, but four stars is generous. I'd say 3.5
Went on Saturday night despite the suicide-inducing 110 minutes of estimated waiting time, and spent the majority of it nibbling on some fabulously juicy prawns, some calamari and lamb samosas (all three very good) and a shitload of alcohol, because how else are you going to deal with life. 
When we were finally seated, our waitress was knowledgeable - which to me is always a plus, cause my knowledge of Indian food is relative- and ended up ordering half the menu, including their special lamb shank ( Lamb Raan) and a boatload of cheese naan and yogurt and chicken and veggies and, yeah. I had to tell my trainer I was significantly over my macros for the evening and he was not a happy bunny. 
Now, as a proper food snob, I'll say this: this place has some fantastic pieces: best of the night was the naan and the chocolate and salt mousse, but the rest was ""just good"". I mean, the lamb raan was a tad salty, and we got a veggie concoction called Pau Baji which was really not great. The chicken was good, but I dont need to be going out to a restaurant to have ""just good""
Will I go back? Potentially, also cause there's a hotel bar nearby that had the HOTTEST single guys I've ever seen all in one place in London, so there you go.",1
5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Had one of the best meals in recent history the other night at Dishoom in Shoreditch. For the quality of cocktails and food, in a city like London, the prices are incredibly reasonable. No wonder the place is packed (so be prepared to wait - it's worth it!).",1
5,Love the ambiance! Exceptional food with great service. Came for the lamb samosas and okra fingers and ordered so much more. So many options great for vegans.,1
5,"Went on a Monday night about 8:30. There was a 90 minute wait for a table but we had nothing else to do so decided to wait. The line outside to just get in took about 30 minutes where we could wait in the crowded bar area to get drinks and starters. We did have really tasty starters - lamb samosas and calamari. Before long we were called for our table and dive into some delicious food. The menu is based on the concept of Iranian cafes in Bombay. The waiter will give you the full story, which is cool, but we were hungry. We had the garlic naan, cheese naan, some amazing Gunpowder potatoes, a lamb kabob that was supposed to be really spicy but wasn't, and a chicken dish I don't remember. The food was excellent and the service was good. My wife isn't a fan of curries and there was plenty here for her. Excellent choice.",1
5,"Great atmosphere, very good service, and excellent food.  The chicken ruby is awesome.",1
5,The bacon naan's here are amazing - the perfect hungover brunch,1
5,really good food. the wait can get quite crazy with a line out the door. if you've got the time for that you won't be disappointed. cocktails are interesting and delicious as well. black dal and mahi tikka are to die for!,1
5,"Amazing place with the best Indian food I have ever tasted, great atmosphere, and all dished out in really genuine and polished service. Had the Ruby chicken (out of this world), black daal (amazing), and cheese naan (crazy good).  Loved the place. Wish we had one in the States.",1
5,"So good! From the House cocktails to the finish. A co-worker recommended and I'm sad it's my last day, so I can't have again before I leave. Definitely on the list for next trip over!
Everything we had exceeded expectations. Watch out though! Some of the dishes are spicy! But so full of flavor, you can't regret it.",1
5,"My wife and I went here on our vacation. Loved it. I'm not big on Indian food, but I'm sold on this place. The server had us try all different kinds of dishes and had us order the perfect amount. Great drinks as well. Highly recommended.",1
5,"I've been to Dishoom twice since my original review, and it definitely deserves a five star update. The wait gets a bit crazy if you're showing up at prime dinner hours (waited two hours Saturday night starting 8:30P), but the food and cocktails make up for it once you're finally seated. For three people we ordered: far far, lamb samosas, pau bhaji, bhel, chicken ruby, vegetable biryani, a lamb dish, black house daal with three garlic naan, and a couple desserts. I'm still stuffed!",1
5,Dishoom was recommended to us by multiple different people. It was absolutely delicious! Decor and atmosphere were both wonderful. The food felt authentic with a little twist of fun. Will definitely be back!,1
3,"Thanks to Katie B for organising the Unconventional Breakfast : Iranian / Indian Edition at Dishoom
The one thing that they've got right in trying to bring a bit of Bombay to Shoreditch (I shouldn't really embarrass Nava by mentioning that she went to the Covent Garden branch!) is that they've got the right smell. I'm not sure what they're pumping into the restaurant but in concert with the ceiling fans, it did have the right atmosphere
Fortunately, our party only consisted of 9 people as they wouldn't allow Katie to book for more than 9. For the record, the restaurant wasn't busy, which brings me to one of the bugbears about our visit. The service was slow. Despite there being lots of servers and them walking past our table continuously, it was hard to get anyone's attention
The best thing I tasted was my rose and cardamom lassi. A unique combination for me and it was delicious
My bacon naan was nice but in my book, it doesn't really deserve its spot on Time Out's best 100 dishes in London last year. The akuri I ordered was at least Indian in that the scrambled egg was spicy
A most pleasant way to have brunch with fun Yelpers but only 3 stars for the food and service",-1
5,I thought I didn't like Indian food. And then I went to Dishoom & immediately jumped on the bandwagon. LOVE.,1
2,"Came here for breakfast with a group of Yelpers. The other half and I were the first to arrive at about 10:45. We sit there looking at the menu. The place is fairly empty. Ten minutes go by. I start staring at the servers (as there are TONS of them) to get someone's attention. I do. She says hello. She walks away. FINALLY one says, ""Has anyone been by to take your order?"" UH, bad start. We order water and two Bloody Marys. They took about twenty minutes. People who arrived at our table after us got drinks before us. Granted they weren't ordering booze, but in no way does it take twenty minutes to make two Bloody Marys. The server claimed that ""they take awhile to make"" but in reality she never really put the order in. They came eventually and were actually quite tasty.
The food was also very tasty. We ordered a bacon naan roll, sausage naan roll, egg naan roll, some spicy eggs on toast and a toasted bun to dip in Chai. The chili tomato jam that goes with the naan rolls (although they were just folded in half, not a roll) was pretty spectacular. The eggs on toast and bun were great too. 
It's just the service. It was so terrible. I'd understand if there was only one server, but there were tons of servers and it was so difficult to get ours to come by. We had to flag her down on multiple occasions to order something because we were ignored. The other half almost had to get his own water because it felt like the water wasn't going to come after we asked for it. I get that we were a large table, but we weren't really demanding, so why ignore us?
Also, I'm not sure why they don't serve their whole menu all day. The breakfast was good, but it would have been nice to supplement it with some of the regular menu (which also looked great).
Not sure we'll be back until they lose the laid back Shoreditch attitude. I want servers who actually want to work and not just stand around being hipsters.",-1
4,"Brunch at Dishoom was fantastic. As it was my first time there- I had the highly recommended bacon naan which didn't disappoint. The portion size was slightly on the small side for brunch so if you're really hungry its probably a good idea to order some extras. Really liked the feel of the place- bright and airy with great decor. Although we sat inside- the front veranda was probably the most impressive part of the building. Service was a little haphazard with our drinks arriving one at a time (there were three of us) and well after our food. Also, this is probably the only Indian restaurant I have ever been to that caters for nut allergy sufferers- usually I avoid Indian restaurants completely as they don't tend to understand the seriousness of nut traces in their food. Will definitely return.",1
4,"Stand out indian food with a constantly evolving menu.
The cooking standards are excellent and the dishes well priced
Always recommend the 24 hour black daal as its creamy gorgeous unctuous vege pleasure
Love the decor and hipster staff
A joy",1
5,"LOVE this place! I've not tried any of their other London venues, but highly recommend this Shoreditch branch. The service is impeccable and every dish is delicious. Can't get enough of the black daal (lunch menu) and bacon naan (breakfast menu) signature dishes. Try and sit outside if the weather permits or book a table upstairs. Downstairs is fine but slightly lacking in the same atmosphere.",1
4,"Great place, great food, great buzz... Back For the second time this week. Need I say more?
They don't do reservations so 1 to 1.5 hr wait to get in and longer to actually have a table and get food, but it's worthed. Be persistent :-)",1
2,I don't think the food is all that and certainly not worth waiting in a line for.,-1
5,"The husband and I love this place very much. And this last time we went, we noticed that the service had improved, as well. Not that we care, because the food is so good it's enough to keep us coming back. 
The okra fingers are finger licking good. You have to try them. Also, the pau bun thing was super yummy - it's a veggie potato mash served with the softest brioche type bun. The shrimp starter was perfectly spiced and we were popping them like popcorn. The raita was fine, not the best.  The naan and roti were warm, soft and fresh. 
We love to try the drinks. So good. I cannot remember the names, but my favorite is a spicy, sour & sweet cocktail. 
Try the pineapple desert - and order it with a scoop of ice cream. So good.  
Finally, we love the space. There's a cute covered outdoor area that's lovely on sunny days. Highly recommend!
So good!",1
3,"Slow service. We were nicely welcomed and taken to our seats. Our waiter immediately got us started with drinks, but when more joined our table, he took their drink orders, but never delivered. I guess that's why you should write orders down :). Then we were left to wait around 50 minutes before he even got around to our food order. It didn't appear the place was short of staff, but efficiency was just not there. Perhaps we were unlucky.
So after over an hour, our food started to arrive. Portions for starters were small. Never have I seen samosas so small and only 3 to a plate for around £5. This place is pricey. But then things took a turn for the better. Extremely nice mains easily sharable for 6 people. The rotis are great with pretty much any dish. The gunpowder potatoes were sublime whilst the black dahl is perhaps a smidge overrated. Get the Chai tea and try some of the stranger desserts. The Pineapple and black pepper crumble was interesting. 
So if you have time to burn and a little cavalier when it comes to value for money, this place is an impressive modern indian fusion restaurant, particularly when it comes to the stranger choices on the menu. Better service would probably help this to 4 stars if I ever make it back.
Note: I was at the Shoreditch branch which was not particularly busy at the time on a weekday.",-1
5,"Best Indian food and best overall dining experience I've ever had. 5 stars across the board. Food, service, atmosphere, price. All exceptional. No wonder this place always has a line out the door. If you're in London, this place is a must.",1
5,"I often find myself disappointed by well recommended restaurants, and with Dishoom being given top spot for Yelp's best 100 restaurants based on people reviews, the expectations were high! 
It did not disappoint. We sat in the veranda which had amazing decor, giving the feel of street side markets in India. We selected about 9 things between 4 of us, including their signature 'Black Daal' (divine) and an array of grills, and paneer dishes. The flavours were excellent and the meat succulent. The only thing I love more than a great meal, is several great meals in one. We arrived early as you can't book and got a table no problem, but just 20 minutes later (7pm) there was a queue forming and this was a Tuesday night! The street food style of this place makes it different from the standard curry houses, and the waiting staff were excellent and super friendly. They also brought us some amazing passion fruit martini shots as it was my boyfriends birthday, and a free desert! When can I come back?",1
5,Was in London for a few days and this restaurant came highly recommended. We first went to the Covent Garden location were the line was pretty long. So we went to the Shoreditch location which was closer to where we were staying. No wait. Food was amazing (definitely order the Dal) and the service even better. Staff let us use their phone to hail a cab. Would highly recommend to anyone travelling to London.,1
5,It was my first time trying this palace Ando would say that the food was amazing. I tried the chicken curry and naan. I would definitely stop by to this place where I'm in London.,1
5,"Lovely place, ambient interior, excellent food! 
Had The Big Bombay breakfast, an good Indian take on a British classic. Love their Chai (refill for free) 
Not my last time here. Love it!",1
5,"Love this place!! Fantastic ambience, delicious drinks, and the good was spot on. This place has eclectic decor and very nice vibe. Highly recommend!",1
5,"I love this place! 
Great food, fun drinks, and an amazing atmosphere.  The design was thought of from top to bottom and it all works together for an amazing experience.  
For a quiet afternoon out on the patio or a night out with friends, it's always a wonderful time.  I will be back again and again...",1
4,"Love love this authentic Bombay cafe - I have heard about Dishoom almost as long as I have been in London and was excited to try here for dinner - there was minimal wait and we were able to wait at the bar anyway trying the whiskey sour and the far far chips (its made of lentils so should be healthy) for mains we went full veggie and got pau bhaji (delicious melt in your mouth), black daal (good if you like the creamy kind - felt like someone just dumped a huge vat of heavy cream in there mm) ans the mutter paneer which I adored since I am in love with this dish and this was one of the best ones I have tasted. Will be back to try their dessert and chai!",1
5,"I guess in the end it all comes down to one questions, does the hype match the results? And in this case I'm happy to say it did! Like many people in London Ive heard about Dishoom over and over and over it was going to make my ears bleed.
The wait wasn't crazy, we waited about an hour and a half for a table, and this lovely little chica came along with some sherry for while i was waiting in the queue, in the little chai cups reminiscent of my time in India. Not only this but I had a cocktail that really brought me back, using a reduction of thumbs up! I was so impressed i raved at the bartender about it for 20 mins and that made the time go fast. I really tasted the thunder in that beautifully put together drink.
Finally the atmosphere was electric and the décor was perfectly in tune with the Parsi Cafe vibe that Dishoom tried to set, now i was worried about food, living in Mumbai for 4 years of my life, meant i had tried some of the best and most authentic Parsi delights the world has to offer, but Dishoom played it off in style, i loved the beautiful simplicity of the dishes while really hitting home those flavours, everything was delicious and the service just as expected. 
Definitely will be visiting again!
Peace & Love",1
4,"Lovely ambience! Delicious! Price is right. Chai is spicy and yummy. Lamb raan too-- so flavorful! I have zero complaints, but I highly recommend coming for lunch so you can make a reservation. It can get packed at night with long waits. Request an outdoor table, if possible. Such a cute little patio area",1
5,Best food I've ever tasted. Hands down. No more needs to be said. Cocktails were incredible.,1
5,"I'm partial to Dishoom. I spent two amazing nights there recently, one of which was NYE and included new friends, mouth watering food, incredible cocktails, and dancing to The Beatles on a dance floor off the kitchen downstairs until the wee hours of the morning. 
Rob. Boon. And a few other folks there really made Dishoom unforgettable. 
Can't wait to go back. Even if Boon is on hiatus, as long as they have that garlic cheese naan, it is worth the flight over from LA. All the rest: beautiful space,tasty authentic Indian food, a fun and eclectic drink menu...  is simply a bonus.",1
3,"The food was great but it all felt a bit rushed and I am immediately put off anywhere that you need to queue. The staff were also a bit rude. The Waiter who took our order more than suggested we were ordering wrong. In summary, great food but not worth queuing for.",-1
4,"Really good food very tasty and the service is amazing! I went there with an amazing yelp friend and we had a great time in there, I'll go back to try more and try to get the ""garden""seat they look fantastic!",1
5,"We had an excellent experience at Dishoom.  We started with the Bombay martinis and then shared a few dishes - all were tasty and an absolute treat.  The food is flavourful and it's great to be able to try and range of different tastes.  
It's also a great change to be able to have a lovely Indian meal in a beautiful environment.  The decor is great, nice vibe, fun atmosphere.  It's also great value for money (cocktails aside!)  Will definitely go back!",1
5,"Ah-maze-ing... Great atmosphere. Great food. Also, lots of dairy free options in case those you're dining with are lactose intolerant. Do it. Eat it. Now.",1
5,"First time in London and eating Indian food. This place was amazing. The wait was a little excessive (you have to wait to get a pager, and thats when the real wait starts) but during our wait for the pager we were offered some tea/shots which was nice! After receiving our pager, we waited by the bar. There's a really cool crowd that attends, the food came out fast! Def recommend the lamb and you HAVE to have the Garlic naan. Delish!",1
5,Awesome! If you have the chance to visit I suggest you do. The food was so different but great. There were loads of veggie dishes to choose from and they have protein in them! A rarity! The decor was so cool but understated. I loved the smell of the place most of all - they were burning incense which was warm and sweet as Bollywood music in the background.,1
5,"Loved this place! Great ambiance, felt really authentic, and very attentive service. The food is much more interesting than many of the Indian dishes I've eaten in the U.S. The cocktails were lovely as well, and prices on par for the neighborhood. The staff was also very accommodating when my friends and I were running late for our reservation.",1
5,"We stumbled upon this place but after having heard rave reviews from friends in the past, decided to try our luck and attempt to get a table.  To our surprise we were told we would only have to wait 5 minutes and were given a table in the verandah at the back of the restaurant.  This area is a lot calmer than the main restaurant but still had a lovely atmosphere.  We chose five dishes between us, the stand outs for me being the Pau Bhaji and the signature Black House Daal.  We also sampled two of the cocktails, both were lovely and very reasonably priced (for London) at £7.50.  The bill came to £49.50, including service which we thought was very reasonable for such a lovely lunch.  Can't wait to return!",1
5,"Ok, okay yeah you probably know that this place is hyped. But, is it worth it?
Ultimately, I would have to say yes, even considering that my friend and I showed up without a reservation at around 7:15PM on a Thursday, and then waited just over an hour for our seats. They let you in to the bar area a little bit earlier (about 30 minutes in to our wait), so at least they get you well liquored. Their drink specials are creative and impressive - a good sign. 
The food though? How is the food? Ok. It was....fantastic. My friend and I are both vegetarian, and we had plenty of options to choose from. Definitely the Black Dal. The paratha was great (although not good for scooping up the dal, as the server suggested but we're risk takers). The paneer? Excellent. The spice levels are just right, meaning they are authentic and yet inviting. I can imagine that someone who is afraid of ""the heat"" will still want to try. 
Lastly - super affordable given the atmosphere (and its trendy hype) and its food! Worth a stop if you're in the area and have a good friend to chat with during the wait.",1
5,"Hmm...where should I start, probably with the calamari, shrimp, and some okra fries! Then a MUST is the flawless house black Daal which is hands down my personal FAVOURITE! My hubby loves the chicken ruby and all the grills are great! The Garlic Naan is also a must alongside the basmati rice! By far the best restaurant in London!",1
5,M favorite Indian fusion restaurant in London. Nice decorstion and a good choice of food. Better go there for lunch to avoid the long queues...,1
5,Fantastic food fantastic atmosphere fantastic service. We arrived at 9 on a Wednesday and waited less than 30mins for a table but found a seat at the bar. The squid was delicious. Highly recommend!,1
4,"So having waited quite a bit outside, then at the bar, we finally were seated. 
The cocktails at the bar were a great appetizer and I was really surprised at them despite their pretentious names and descriptions.
The style is Bombay so lots of small dishes to share. It was like no other Indian I've ever tasted. 
The lamb shoulder fell off the bone and yes, I'm still dreaming about it. The cheesy naan was succulent. I came away full but not bursting and super satisfied...yummmm!",1
4,"Tasty breakfast with an Indian twist! Make sure you book, I would give it five stars but the staff weren't overly helpful!",1
5,"BEST.BRUNCH.EVER.
Beaut location and it just looks and smells nice.
And it's rather cheap! 
I've now been here a few times and every time I'm so happy.
I always have the naan with bacon, eggs and chilli jam, but I've tried a few things from their lunch menu and they're also scrumptious.
I mean, seriously, you all need to go.
But it gets booked up really quickly so bear that in mind ;)",1
4,"We waited for two hours. Literally. The staff at the reception had an attitude. I have every right to ask how many more minutes left, but they were just annoyed with that. Food was amazing. Loved the spices and the menu. I have to admit, the price was unbelievably good for what we ate. I pay four times what i payed there than in luxurious Indian restaurants like Amaya. Honestly, Dishoom was more authentic.",1
2,"Flavors were off.  This place is overrated.   Felt like I was in an Indian Cheesecake factory.
Not impressed.... don't know what all the lines and rave reviews are all about??!",-1
5,I haven't even paid my bill yet. This place is amazing the lamb raan and black daal combination is beyond amazing. I would fly back to London from the US just for this.,1
4,"The place had really nice, light, friendly feel to it and some nice design touches in the decor but as this is Shoreditch the ceiling was stripped back, exposing big silver air pipes and old concrete.
The breakfast menu is full of intriguing dishes, based on familiar classics but with a hint of India. We ordered a few dishes to share, Akuri - Spicy scrambled (akuri or bhurji) eggs--an Irani café staple. Piled up richly on Fire Toast and served with tomatoes grilled on the vine. Sauage Naan Roll - a Britisher Cumberland sausage, placed in the midst of fresh hot naan with chill tomato jam, cream cheese and herbs and a Bombay Omelette - a crazy-paving omelette of chopped tomato, onion, coriander and green chilli. Served with tomatoes grilled on the vine and Fire Toast. which were all served with a lovely tomato and chilli based dip and also tried the Green Darjeeling Tea and the House Chai which was perfect for a cold Winter's day, full of balanced spices and a nice hit of ginger.
All the dishes we had were very good, just the right amount of chilli heat in the Akuri and Bombay Omelette and complimented by the Fire Toast, which is 'toasted' on the grill to give it a nice smoky flavour. The Naan for the Sausage Naan Roll was fresh, crisp and light and would probably be a great hangover cure.",1
5,"Came here for a quick lunch. Was seated right away no problem. 
The waiter was extremely nice and went into detail of their menu for me as well as how he recommends I should order, which was great. 
The food came out fast and was amazing. The presentation was beautiful, especially for the lamb chops. I ended my meal with a nice Chai, which was phenomenal.
Definitely recommend it and I will for sure be back.",1
4,"After hearing good things about this place, I had to give it a try! Me and a friend popped along on a Wednesday evening. After waiting well over 45 minutes in the queue(apparently there is always a long wait)
The food was top notch however. Being a vegetarian, the Black Dal did not disappoint, and the Roomali Roti's were freshly made by hand.
With a buzzing , great atmosphere & large drinks selection, it was somewhere that definitely I would go back too.
Would have 5 stars, if it wasn't for the long wait, or they took reservations!! :)",1
4,"The food in this place is incredible, really good and very affordable. Great value for price for sure! The terrace is great too, nice exotic atmosphere, cushions, sweet tea dishes and colours. The only downside is the queue. You might end up queuing for almost and hour and when you get in there is another queue which is annoying. Try to go on days that aren't too busy, it's worth a visit",1
5,"Okay, whether you are a local or just visiting this place is an absolute MUST if you like Indian food. There are places that have great food but so-so ambiance. Or the service is outstanding but location isn't that great. This place has it all. Including collapsible high chairs (the type that just hook onto the table - why don't more places have these?) and, get this, etch-a-sketch boards for the kiddos! How fricken cool is that?
The restaurant is enormous. Two stories and a beautiful, peaceful looking patio out front. Dark wood and décor give a warm vibe to the place. And located in Shortditch, it's set in a cool neighborhood with lots of cool, funky shops. Plus, it's reasonable prices for excellent fare with wonderful service. Doesn't get much better than that.
Now for the food and drink. The Chai tea drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic options) were so tasty and perfect for a cold day. We enjoyed the most amazing Okra Fries, Mahi Tikka, Sheekh Kabab Lamb, and House Black Daal with naan. If you don't order anything else, the fries and the daal are a must. My husband usually doesn't care for daal and he was scooping every last morsel up in this dish!
So Mahi in Bombay can be any kind of fish. This one happens to be a basa fillet and it is cooked to buttery perfection. The lamb, with the lime and spices was straight up delicious.
The bonus to the menu is that it's all tapas style. I'm all about small dishes so you can try a number of things. So for our party of 6 adults, it worked out well to just have each couple order dishes to share rather than trying to find a few things for the whole table. I'm a little sad that I live across the pond from this incredible place but I will definitely be back the next time we visit!",1
5,"If you're in search of something different for brunch, you've found it. And if you're not in search of something different for brunch, you've still found it. I was curious to try Indian-style brunch after a friend recommended it, and I was far from disappointed. The Chai tea made me realise that in fact, anything else I have previously thought was Chai was nothing more than a poor imitation --it was sweet, spicy and delicious. I had the Egg Naan Roll as my meal, and it was also divine.",1
5,"If you want to eat indian food in London, this might be the place to do it.
Its got a hip atmosphere, authentic flavors, friendly service and great food.
The chai I had was good, not extra warm as I had requested :-(
I had the a chicken tikka dish, their pao bhaji, both were  very authentic and tasty.",1
5,"I was wet, cold, hungry, and cranky while waiting for my husband to finish up record shopping at Rough Trade, and found this place via online search.  
I was skeptical because there were so many publications giving this place a great review, I thought maybe they just had really good PR. 
We were able to thankfully grab a table right away, ordered some drinks as it was a day that ended in a ""Y"", and ordered: Bhel, Chicken Tikka, Mattar Paneer,  Black Dahl, and Plain Naans. We ate every single piece of food that we ordered, it was so tasty! 
Sad we don't live out there, but if we ever do go back to London,  we're definitely eating here again!",1
3,"Great atmosphere, really good starters but just ok on the mains. The highlights were cocktails prior to dinner and the chicken pomegranate salad... the ruby curry was the biggest disappointment of the meal.  I would go back, but would probably just order a bunch of starters to share - if you want a good curry, stick to your favorite local or brick lane joint.",-1
4,"After a long day of playing a tourist it was a good oasis for Indian food and good drinks.
We had paneer tikka, chole batura, vada pav and pav bhaji. Pretty good food.
The drinks are nice though i did not like their house recipe for Old Fashioned. 
The place is hip with keen, friendly and engaging staff with decent mix of music.",1
3,"Admittedly, being from Indian heritage, any Indian restaurant is going to have to punch well above its weight to impress me.
Dishoom in Shoreditch has a slight 'rough around the edges' interior style, and a lovely veranda area. And the staff are lovely - whoever did the hiring here definitely did a great job, as they all are personable, genuine and really go out the way to be friendly and make you feel comfortable. I already wanted to really love this place.
I ordered the Mango Lassi to begin with, as I do enjoy a good Mango Lassi. However, this one won the award for the worst I've ever had. Boooo Hissss. It was weak, and though tasted yogurty, the mango was lacking.
The lamb samosas weren't bad (and bonus points for the Gujarati filo), and the Pau Bhaji was yummy - I recommend that as a starter. The Chicken Ruby was also nice, albeit a bit on the heavy side. Overall, however, I wasn't blown away as the spice level was very mild.
I did appreciate the menu maintains traditional integrity, omitting beef and pork from the menu (not exactly staples of the Indian diet), which is more than can be said for some other Indian restaurants.
Overall, I would probably recommend Dishoom to somebody who wanted to sample Indian food for the first time, but I likely wouldn't eat there myself.. not because the service or setting isn't lovely, but because I don't feel the food was quite like home.",-1
5,"I really had a blast at Dishoom, a combination of friends and family going for dinner. We arrived rather late but still an hour wait in the bar for a company of 4, we should have booked a table and will the next time because I can assure you that we'll be coming back there. 
The food was really the best part, I simply loved everything. One of us has spent quite some time working in India and it was apparently the best Indian food she's had outside India. 
Staff were friendly, not pushy and attentive enough.
Considering that this is something we'll remember for a long time I think that the price we paid which ended up at just under 30£ per person after tip, including beer at the bar was definitely worth it.",1
5,"We went here  for lunch a couple if weeks ago with our 2 year old son.  From the moment  we walked in nothing was too much trouble and the staff looked after us very well.  The food is incredible, you need to try the lamb  raan and black dhal,  I could eat it every day.  We also had chicken  tikka, raita and rotis,  all excellent.  Finished off with a kulfi  and the best chai  I've had since I was last in India.",1
5,"I looove love love love love Dishoom!!! 
drinks check!
food check!
service check!
I am a fan! The Okra fries superb! loved the mix of Chutneys. I had the chicken ruby which was a fabulous curry. I took some left over home to my husband who is Indian. He loved it and now wants to go with me next time!
 The only thing I would recommend to Dishoom is to put more curries on their menus as there are only two curries. Everything else is more dry style think grilled or Biryani (rice pots). I am not a fan of Biryanis I find them to dry. 
Chaijito was very yummy which is an indian take on a mojitos with mint, coriander, chair syrup, ginger and lime.",1
4,"What can I say? Fantastic food!  Went here for Brunch with during my trip in London.  
BEST MEAL in London.  
We ordered the 
(bottomless) porridge
Omelette 
Fried Chicken Liver 
Coffee!!! 
Everything came out wonderful especially the chicken liver!  The waiter was extremely attentive and asked about our trip.  On top of my recommendation list for my friends who's ever considering visiting London! 
Will be back for sure, if i'm in London.",1
2,"Dry curry and rice. Thought it was only the dish I ordered (paneer) so didn't want to judge too soon. I was wrong, it was the same for the other meat dishes my two friends ordered. The non-authentic vibe and location is what attracted me to this restaurant. It's a shame that the food didn't match up to the high standards of decoration and furnishing. Good atmosphere and place looks good but food is very average.",-1
5,"I celebrated my upcoming 40th with 14 of my friends here. I was a bit concerned about the service considering it's a hot spot and we were a large party, but I have to say, their service was superb, I wish I could remember the name of our waiter since he deserves a public rave. 
I'm not an Indian food fan and dishoom changed that. The food was simply incredible and every dish was full of unique flavours. 
I highly recommend this place.",1
5,Perfect. I was having a bad night and this still ranks amongst the best meals I've ever had. I wish I could eat there every night.,1
5,"For those impatient food review readers, I'll help you out and give you the bottom line right away: DISHOOM IS WELL WORTH A VISIT WITH EVERYTHING BEING BEYOND DELICIOUS. WAIT IN AN HOUR LINE BY ALL MEANS, IT'S A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 
Now for the normal folk. Dishoom takes the traditional indian vibe and classic entrees and takes them up to entirely different level of flavor and overall ambiance. Dishoom tries very hard to transport their customers with not only the menu design/descriptions of the items, but to the overall decor. The vibe echoed from this place is worth a good amount of pounds alone. I honestly felt that I was no longer in London when I first walked through this establishment's pristine doors. 
The food, as above stated, is simply out of this world. Everything is perfectly spiced with an array of flavors and spices present in any single dish on the menu. I have been to Dishoom three times, once for breakfast, lunch and dinner. As I am a writing this review I already know that I am going tomorrow for lunch. For the sake of clarity, I will just talk about what I had for lunch and dinner since the menus are the same. I have gotten the Murgh Malai, the Chicken Tikka, the side green side, the garlic naan, and the Bhel. The Murgh Malai and the Chicken Tikka are both chicken dishes that are beyond flavorful, aromatic,  and juicy. The chicken is just succulent; hands down the best chicken I have ever had. The garlic naan is served piping hot so you know it is fresh, and boy is it delicious. The Bhel is this puffed rice salad with spices, pomegranate, and mint, and it is a great refreshing salad as is the green salad.
Now to the drinks. The drink menu is absolutely divine, and boy is there an array of options. Both times for lunch and dinner, I ordered the Bombay Pimm's since I cannot get enough of it. It either comes in a glass or you can order a ""jug""of it. I considered ordering a jug the second time I was here, but considering I was alone, didn't want to seem like an alcoholic, and wanted to avoid any possible incident, I decided to restrain myself. I could honestly, without shame or regret, drink an entire barrel full of the Bombay Pimm's if nobody was around that I could cause harm to. How can you go wrong with saffron gin, mint, pomegranate, ginger beer, and citrus?
All-in-all, and certainly needless to say, just swing by. If it could live here I would. The drinks are delicious (and certainly could be endless), the food is so delicious, that  you may honestly moan with delight in your seat considering the sensual mouth-orgy that is going on due to the knockout deliciousness of the entrees, and the ambiance just makes you take everything in leaving you sitting there well beyond the point when your check arrived. If I could be a part owner/investor I would, but im broke so...
Just come and transport yourself to a magical place. All it honestly takes to change your life and become a convert is to just walk through the door.",1
4,"East London Coolness + Indian Goodness = OH YEAH!
Came in here for a late lunch and a drink while wandering around East London. I didn't look at the menu but asked the server to just bring me his top recommendations for a light meal. I ended up with the lamb skewer and black dahl with naan. It was the perfect snack.
On top of the great food, the atmosphere was amazing. Looking forward to my next visit.",1
5,"I had never been to an Indian Restaurant before this. I heard that London had some of the best Indian food in the world, so I decided it was the best time to try it. The atmosphere was really nice, and had a great setting to go with groups of friends. I had the spicy lamb chops and the cheese and garlic Naan. Service was great, would definitely return on my next trip to London!",1
2,"Meh. The first time I went to Dishoom about 3 years back I was blown away. I did an unconventional breakfast with a big group of people at the restaurant off of St Martin's Lane. The chai tea was delightful and I remember leaving with a full and happy belly.
This time around, I guess a number of meh parts about the meal contributed to the perfect storm.
1) Weekend brunch is served til noon.  Okay, you may say, just get up and go - but on a Saturday mid-day, sometimes I just want want to sleep in and crawl to a hare of the dog breakfast for some eggs. Luckily I showed up early for a breakfast date planned for noon with a girlfriend and held the waiter hostage with promises that he would continue serving us even as she arrived at 12:01.
2) Food: Actually not bad at all - the price is right here and I had the Akuri spicy scramble - only thing is the food came out kind of cold and when I was done, I was still starving. This sounds like a waaah complaint but I found myself looking longingly over at the Albion only across the road, serving brunch all day long in perfect proportions.  Next time I'll review after choosing differently, perhaps more wisely. When I finished this course, even if I was hoping for more food it was going to be off the regular lunch/dinner menu which I just wasn't prepared for so early (ish) in the weekend day.
3) Drinks -The Dhoble - the description of a refreshing breakfast coctail of OJ, gin, maraschino liqueur won me over - but first sip was wholly alcohol. This is not what I meant by Hare of the Dog!  At 9 quid I wouldn't say this is a must - next time I'll leave the day drinking up to one of places nearby, like the rooftop Boundary around the corner. 
All in all I was a bit let down this time - I think I'll hold off on the Dishoom brunch and stick to dinner for the next round...",-1
5,"I don't think they need any extra help getting any more business considering that the lines often wrap around the building. Wonderful food, great value for what they charge. Go early so that you don't have to wait as long.",1
4,"After spending 6 months living in India, it takes something a little bit special for me to make a British curry house a regular haunt of mine. 
I can say that whilst the décor and western style atmosphere is as far removed from India as Columbus thinking he'd arrived there when he's actually discovered the Americas, Dishoom get it right when it comes to the authentic taste of India: spice blends that are unique and exciting; fresh simple, top quality ingredients and menu items that you wouldn't usually get from the generic high street British Indian restaurant. 
My top tips for dining at Dishoom are:
Breakfast - it's all about the Bacon naan (yes, I did say Bacon naan) with their homemade masala chai - the perfect way to start any weekend breakfast/brunch (although they do serve breakfast 7 days a week) 
Dinner - The Roomali Roti's are amazing and the perfect accompaniment to a Mahi Tikka (Fish curry) and Mattar Paneer (Indian cottage cheese and peas) 
Beer - make sure you try their special Dishoom Pale ale which is brewed in collaboration with Beavertown brewery; it's less gassy and suits the blends of the spices much better than Kingfisher.",1
4,"Shoreditch Dishoom is actually a little bit cooler, bigger and for some reason I like it better than Covent Garden (maybe cause it's less rushed and crammed all the time).
Normally I wouldn't copy paste a review for another but below is my review for the Dishoom in Covent Garden, which still applies to Shoreditch's one :) 
Bear out the wait! It's never as long as they say, and worth it for the free chai (dirty if you are lucky). If there is a place in Central London I like to eat in more, I haven't found it. Having loved and lived in Mumbaj it makes me nostalgic for lunch and dinner dates in Cafe Britannia and other Parsi cafés. 
If you or members of your group aren't used to eating Indian food, this is a great introduction with something for everyone. I've brought family, friends, and dates. Kick it off with a cocktail, all are good, but I especially recommend an off the menu item called the 'Dhoble' (Dub-lay; named after Mumbai's infamous Polic Commissioner)- just ask them to ask the bar staff.
I'm a big fan of the pau bhaji/bhel/vada pau for starters. Highly recommend the Biryani or Bhoti kabobs for mains. No order will be complete without the house Black Daal (my Keralan GF adores it). Remember it's easier and cheaper to share- most dishes can serve two. Mop it all up with a roomali roti (handkerchief roti- ask to see them make it, it's epic).
Truthfully dessert isn't as strong as the rest. Go for the kulfi on a stick. Chai is too small a portion in my opinion, coffee is fine but not done in traditional pulled fashion. Just grab cocktail 2 or 3 instead :)
I'd be surprised if it comes to more than £30pp :)",1
4,"Nice food in a unique space, especially pleasant when you're sitting in the ""garden"" area (glass house of tables at the front of the space with plenty of light streaming through a retractable roof, which they close when the chill of night settles in, or if it begins to rain). 
The food is a different from what you'd find at a curry house (and curries are only a very small part of the menu - think more grilled sauteed or tandoori type of dishes). It's ordered like small plates - choose 2-3 per person and go to town on the array. The meats can be hit or miss, some were super tender and falling off the bone, others were dry and chewy. However, every dish was extremely flavorful, lots of kick with the heat and heavy on the spices than most. They go similarly extreme on the cream and butter factor, but in the end with small plates this is a good thing... At such concentrations of flavor, a little goes a long way!",1
5,"What a lovely spot with interesting food.  It's not quite Indian - but rather, it's a Persian take on Indian - so you will get some distinctively non-Indian variations on otherwise Indiany food - like cole slaw or raw vegetables (there will probably never be raw veggies in any typical Indian dish!), or use of spices that you don't typically find in Indian cooking.  On the other hand, some of the food does not seem all that different from traditional Indian - like the signature black daal. 
The setting is fantastic - there's this amazing convertible outdoor area, with either table seats or low seating with somewhat overly soft chairs.  I love the photos hanging and the distressed wood.  The roof looks like it peels back for the rare sunny day - which it was on my visit. 
The menu has loads of choices, and though the server recommended 3 dishes per person, I think that's actually much.  Loads of veg options, and plenty of delicious meaty ones too, including their signature lamb dish - which comes in either a whole leg (or was it rack?) for sharing or the bun for one (which really is a lot of food and could serve as a real entree for one). 
Even though we over-ordered, the bill came out to just slightly over 20 pounds per person - which is not bad for our delicious bounty (by London standards - I am not from here and finding all food quite pricey here).  
Service is also lovely.  When my friend spilled his juice, he actually got a complimentary refill (and napkins and a rag right away). 
And remember - this is not meant to be an Indian restaurant! The staff are quick to correct you on that if they notice you making that mistake - and there is a section on the menu that explains this concept.",1
5,"I absolutely loved the bacon naan during breakfast! I ended staying for awhile and so I also ordered from the lunch menu. I ate the black daal and it was delightful!
The bacon naan was good, the daal was amazing! You should definitely come for lunch or dinner. This place lives up to the hype!",1
5,"Delicious Indian tapas style restaurant. Food is absolutely outstanding. Interior design is very cosy and the outside terrace is stunning. Only downside is that you may have to wait over 1 hour on weekends to be seated, but luckily they have great cocktails at their bar which makes waiting time enjoyable.",1
4,"Yep, Dishoom has a fan in me.
With an overly trendy place in Shoreditch, you expect the worst. Higher unjustified prices, average quality and take-it-or-leave-it service. Not the case here, especially when you compare Dishoom against its traditional competitors over in Brick Lane. You see, Dishoom doesn't carry the price tag you'd expect, and is in fact a little bit cheaper - and a very respectable quality to boot. Yes, I admit, some of the menu names and descriptions are hard to fathom and err on the side of wanky, but don't be too put off.
The drinks menu is fun, and you could easily just treat this place as a bar and leave very happy. Not cheap mind, but their cocktails are well made and imaginative. 
The food here ranges from ok to actually really rather good. My favourite was the lamb chop, closely followed by the biryani. I can forgive the average naan. Indian food done well, and without the grease.
The place has an exciting feel to it. Certainly very different to the white table-clothed Indian restaurants you're used to - it's decked out in original decor that might just cause you to take a very long toilet break as you stop and look at/read the stuff on the wall. The bow-tied subservant waiters are gone too, replaced by the young/trendy type who strangely have the same hair cut (girls and boys), but they just about get it right - informative and not overly up their own arse. Which is a pleasant treat for Shoreditch.
The courtyard is great for the warmer months.
I'll be back.",1
5,"Absolutely loved this place! The atmosphere, the food, the complimentary drink while queuing outside - outstanding! Very glad we stopped by this place which was one of the highlights of our trip to London.",1
4,"Came here for dinner with 2 other people on a Saturday night. Expect about an hour wait if you get here around 8pm. You can grab a drink in the bar as you wait. Nice selection of drinks and served fresh.
Chicken tikka - nice flavor. spicy. Recommend getting the yogurt (raita) to cool down your mouth. 
Garlic naan pretty standard and good.
Roomali roti was very nice change to naan. 
House black daal was my favorite. Not too spicy and a very large portion served.
Chicken ruby was delicious. Similar to chicken tikka masala in my opinion. Great flavor and spice to it.",1
3,"London's tidal wave of shabby chic, cultural-niche themed restaurants seems unstoppable. I'd classify Dishoom in this category. 
My rating is based on a dinner for 5 around 8pm on a Monday.
Pros
* Really tasty, freshly made inventive recipes. Big flavours and variety of textures.
* Good, original cocktail selection
* Well executed décor giving a believable ambiance to the facade.
Cons
* Staff seem employed for looks rather than ability/competence (more on that later, I appreciate that this seems to be the modus operandi of most of the East End these days)
* Portions don't match the price - the 'leg of lamb' was £21 and is meant for 2 sharing, yet it's just a decent serving for 1. Our waiter claimed only 1 person has finished it themselves before - seems unlikely chief. It also is a pile of shredded meat 'next to' an alarmingly bare looking bone - no visible signs that ever the twain had met.
*  Side dishes are significantly overpriced - £5 for coleslaw or Okra chips...
I know the recession hit hard, but carrots, cabbage, mayo and pomegranate haven't gone through the roof just yet.
*  The place is huge, so there is often a delay in ordering drinks. Our food came quite quickly but we waited 45 minutes for cocktails at one point.
The overall experience was pretty good, really enjoyed the food, though it is definitely overpriced. The cocktails tasted great, especially the Badam Alexander and the 1850 Julep - both with plenty of booze.
Our waiter was amiable yet  slightly incompetent. A common pairing. If you're going to wear a novelty santa hat you need to back your look up with unerring professionalism, otherwise you just seem a bit of a clown. And if you fail to clear glasses and food away until 30 minutes after the meal, fail to submit a drinks order completely and don't give change even after the 12.5% discretionary gratuity has been included and paid for, then I'm afraid you're not ready for maitre' d just yet.
I'd go back for a light early evening dinner and one cocktail, keep it short and simple and be able to leave without clutching your wallet in alarm.",-1
2,"Bah!  I don't know what to make of Dishoom.  I really don't.
You walk in, and the music and atmosphere would lead you to believe you're walking into a Cuban restaurant.  You look at the menu, and there are maybe 3 of the Indian standards you're used to seeing.  They only serve chicken thighs.  They don't serve chicken breast.  The service is... odd.  It's not that it's bad, per se, but for example, my cousin ordered a ""white americano"" and the lady helping us out was all... ""white?  You want milk?  Ooooookayyyyy..."" like ordering coffee with milk was the weirdest thing she'd ever heard of.
I ordered the Murgh Malai.  It was alright.  It was standard grilled chicken thighs with some spice thrown in.  Nothing special, but it did taste nice.  The black daal, which they say is their signature dish, is good... but I've had better.  I did really enjoy the okra fries which were deliciously crisp and not at all slimy as okra can sometimes be.  But on the other hand, the naan was way overcooked and totally burned on one side.  I have also been for the breakfast, and I will say that the bacon naan roll was pretty good, but again... it's two pieces of bacon, naan, and cream cheese.  Eh.
If you have a craving for standard curries and Indian fare, Dishoom isn't the place to visit.",-1
5,"I'm highly critical of Indian food given that I grew up with an amazing mama who cooks it the best. Came to Dishoom in Shoreditch while visiting my sister and everything we had was incredible. 
I highly recommend the following:
- rose, cardamom lassi (light and subtle flavors...not heavy at all)
- limbu pani (soda water with lemon and spices) 
- lamb samoosas
- lamb raan (the bun or as is)
- pav bhaji (great on a rainy day) 
- paneer and mango salad 
- falooda for dessert 
If you can find a table in the patio, I would recommend requesting a table there. The atmosphere itself is old school Bombay and you can tell they have put a lot of attention to detail!",1
5,"Loved this place! Went here with friends for a birthday and intend to go again soon.
Obviously the food is fantastic, but it's also quite refreshing to find a place where the mocktails aren't a total rip off. While we waited for a table (dinner reservations are only available for groups of six or more) we had passionfruit sharbats - perfect for the warm evening and unlike anything else I'd ever had before. Fortunately, we didn't have to kill time drinking too many of these, and were shown to our table fairly promptly, despite it being dinner time on a Sunday.
There were five of us in total, and our waiter was particularly helpful - advising us to try and pick as much variety as possible, and letting us know that we'd probably only need one or two servings of rice between us (we were about to order three bowls). When our food arrived it was amazing. It arrived surprisingly rapidly and tasted really fresh. Personally, I was feeling a bit under the weather, and while I'm sure that the food isn't exactly healthy or low calorie, it felt really nourishing and quite gentle on my stomach; something I wouldn't expect from Indian food, which can often be overpowering and heavy.
Even though we ate quite a lot, for some reason we decided to order dessert as well. Quite a gluttonous move, so maybe go a bit easy on the main course if you want to sample the dessert menu as well! I chose the guju chocolate mousse - a rich, slightly salty mousse which comes with berries.
Another good thing about Dishoom is that they don't automatically add on the service charge. We tipped our waiter generously because the service was so good, but it's still nice for it to be left to your discretion. I hate having to kick up a fuss when I've received below par service which I'm then expected to pay extra for.
By the time we left, I was completely stuffed and I barely ate a thing the day after. But when my appetite returned, I wanted to go straight back to Dishoom!",1
5,Best Indian food in London. I go at least once a month. Pork chops are great! So are samosas.,1
4,"So after a night of dancing in London till dawn, I rose from bed around lunch time and, stomach roaring, went on the hunt for some food. Luckily for me I stumbled on Dishoom which was hidden away down a side street that happened to catch me eye! Curry for breakfast, hell yeah!
Service was polite and prompt, I didn't get the brush off treatment I have received elsewhere on asking for a table for one. So top marks there. I sat outside on their beautiful plant draped terrace, it felt a world away from London. I ordered steamed rice with Mattar Paneer and some house chai. The chai is absolutely delicious, aromatic, spicy but not too sweet. However it comes in a tiny portion, I could have easily enjoyed more.
The food arrived quickly and was beautifully spiced and fresh tasting, the rice was delicate and light. I only wish I had had time to make a return visit, as there was so much on the menu I would have loved to try. I'd say it'd be a great spot to have  lunch with a group to get a few dishes to share.
It was pretty pricy to my eye - but I'd say it's competitive for London prices, and there was a lovely atmosphere to the place so i was happy to spend.",1
5,"We went here at 7:30pm without a reservation and there was a 1.5hr wait on a table for 2, so we decided to come back the night after. 
We arrived at 6pm to ensure we got a table (they only take reservations for 6 people or more). The concept is smaller dishes to share. Their food is SO flavoursome and fresh, some of the best modern indian I have ever eaten.
I would definitely go here again, simply delicious!!!",1
5,"Excellent Oriental Lunch for £30 in a unique colonial ambiance! Dishoom serves Indian and Iranian excellent dishes that are perfect for share. We got the Chicken Ruby, which was amazing! In addition, we got the Iranian lamb dish, which was also great (a note for the cook: the lamb was just a little bit dry) and the daal, superb! Including two naans, we paid in total 30 pounds. Reasonable prices and excellent plates served in a really beautiful restaurant with colonial style in the heart of the trendy neighborhood of Shoreditch. Do not miss it in your next trip to London!",1
3,"Fair warning to those who go to Indian restaurants for some heat. It's not even close to packing a punch. I've heard great things but didn't seem to have ordered the right things. I had a chicken tikka wrap which served to be a reasonable lunch portion but definitely felt like I was still eating on the light side. It almost felt like eating a spring roll. I asked for extra chili pepper and mixed that in with the sweet tomato jam sauce and raised the spice level to my taste. I guess it turned out alright. 
So if you want a hip place (think Bill's brunch but for Indian food?) and don't need your food to be particularly interesting, it's great ambiance. Again, not worth the price for the food, but for the ambiance.",-1
4,"Fantastic Indian food in the heart of Shoreditch. The atmosphere alone is worth a trip, and then you add on the delicious food and it is near perfection. We enjoyed tika masala, paneer, and lamb, all with deep, complex, and spicy flavors. The tea was the perfect accompaniment to our meal. Definitely worth the trip if you find yourself in Shoreditch!",1
5,Shares a selection of dishes amongst friends and had an all round great experience. The food was a+ and the service was great. Would highly recommend the okra fries.,1
3,"supaaah late review. Mind you, this is from a few err..months back. It was for the UYE unconventional breakfast series. The second one featuring indian style breakfast. Thanks Katie B for organising it!
I get it, it's sunday morning and the wait staff just don't want to deal with a massive party. They've probably had really rough nights, but not even a smile? A fake screwed on one? No? okay. The food wasn't great. I loved the flavour of my chai chocolate but, it actually arrived lukewarm. Is that supposed to be a thing? I don't get it.
The sausage naan roll was okay, it wasn't stellar and it needed alot of the asian style jam/chutney to make it easier to eat! 
I just didn't warm up to you Dishoom (pun unintended), it wasn't exciting enough, for an unconventional breakfast.",-1
5,"An impressively designed and decorated place from the entrance to this branch to when you walk into and dine at this location. There are beautiful flowers along the entry path with picnic benches for enjoying cocktails and food al fresco when we have sunny weather. They now have a fab summer verandah. Amazing cocktails created by the knowledgeable bartenders at the well-designed The Permit Bar; a relaxing environment for drinks// cocktails and catching up with friends in an eye-catching bar. They create a wider variety of drinks and cocktails than the Covent Garden branch, perfectly made to original cocktail recipes but adding their own unique twist, like nimbu pani and the Bombay Martini; plus they will create variations of cocktails on the menu to customers requests without hesitation, like a whisky chai, whereas the Covent Garden branch bartenders were unwilling to go off the bar menu. Fabulous food created by the kitchen team, lead by the pleasant and friendly Head Chef Yash, especially the street food like samosas, fresh and crispy bhel puri and vada pau (the Indian version of a chip butty). Save space for their mango or malai kulfi (which has a lovely addition of caramel) and their melt-in-the-mouth nankhatais. Pleasant and efficient service. Overall, great place for Indian and Asian food, and would recommend in a heartbeat!",1
5,"What a great experience! The service was top notch, the food was amazing, prices were decent.
In my search for places to try on my trip to London, Dishoom seemed like an obvious choice. The reviews were impeccable!
We arrived a bit later in the evening, we were greeted almost at once and told the wait was about an hour. I read that an hour wait is usually not always an hour so we agreed. While waiting in line to get to the bar area we were served a choice of mint tea, their AMAZING chai, or another drink (I stopped listening when I heard chai). All of the staff was so amazingly kindly chatty.
We got inside and were given a buzzer and were able to go over to the bar area. The cocktails were probably my favorite part. Oh, mama were they good!! I want to go back and only drink cocktails!!
We were seated in about 45 minutes, in the outside area, thank god, because I love my more quiet dinners as I get older. hah. 
The food was amazing. Standouts for me were the Naan, Chicken ruby, calamari, an",1
5,"When I first visited Dishoom, I was greeted by a staggering queue on a cold, London winter night. But thankfully I stuck around. We were served shots of their naughty cholocate chai, which instantly quelled my frosty nose and met with very helpful, friendly service to guide us through our wait.
I've returned to both Dishoom locations many times and have always been met with fresh, zesty cocktails, impeccable atmosphere, perfect service and of course, absolutely mouth-watering food! Every visit prompts me to order the simple, yet delicious far far, ultra-rich and satisfying black daal and the ever-tasty okra fries topped off with a refreshing East India gimlet.
Both locations have a great environment for socialising and sharing plates, and with reasonable prices a visit (or three) is a must!",1
4,"After hearing so much about it, I finally made it to Dishoom.  I came for an afternoon snack on Sunday.  It was quite busy (as seems to be the case with all Dishoom locations all the time ..) but I got seated immediately as a single diner.  I sat on the front deck, which had plastic sheeting pulled down and heaters to make it feel indoors.  The classy decor (carpeting, couches) made it actually feel more like a living room than a deck.  Quite elegant in fact.
I ordered House Chai and Pao Bhaji -- but they had run out of the chai (?!?!?).  Instead I had Darjeeling green tea.
For both, the quality and quantity were wonderful, and quite reasonably priced.  I especially loved the 3 chutneys which I added liberally to the bhaji -- chili, coriander, and tamarind (?).
Service was fairly good, if a bit delayed -- I ordered some extra Pao (fried bun) which took too much time to come out.  Also took some time to get my receipt and finally pay.
Loved the atmosphere, loved the food, missed the masala chai , and could do with a little more attentive service.  Will def be back to try out more on the menu!",1
5,"THE BEST Indian/Bombay café in LONDON! We found this place walking in Shoreditch and saw the line wrapped around the build. Well when you see that, you know it's gotta be good! And it was... THE BEST Indian dishes ever. 
YES I'll repeat, If the line is wrapped around the building it is completely worth the Wait! 
If the hosts tell you 1hr+ waiting list... YOU WAIT. Everything about this place is wonderful!
Be sure to try the Black House Daal & Lamb Raan.",1
5,"you NEED to eat here! Just went today and it is absolutely amazing all around. As for drinks, the chai tea is delicious, as well as all the virgin alcoholic drinks. All the food is absolutely delicious, likely the best indian food I have ever had. The atmosphere is wonderful, a Bombay experience! We loved it, absolutely would recommend.",1
1,"After hearing so much hype about this place finally tried it out on our visit to London.  The most horrible food I had ever tasted.  Was totally disappointed with the menu.  We waited one hour and half to get a table.  It was way too noisy.  As we were sitting down the waiter was telling us what the kitchen currently cannot make.  Due to them changing the oil he had said no fried food, and he will let us know when the kitchen will start serving it.  He never came back to let us know.  After looking at the other tables getting fried food I asked our waiter who said he will check the kitchen to see if I can order Vada pav. There were couple of things the waiter mentioned that could not served. Wish they had told us this while we were waiting.  There was nothing special about the food at all. Everything was a bit too sour for my liking.",-1
4,"I've enjoyed this place very much! I came here for breakfast and it was awesome. That mix of Indian - English breakfast was surprisingly good! I had the naan roll with eggs and bacon...  and the chai very good too. It's a must if you like Indian food and you want to change your regular breakfast, and you have many options. A warm place with a great service! I will repeat for sure :)",1
1,"Very poor service, finished my meal before receiving a drink. Asked twice about not having my drink while eating. Servers did nothing to fix this. I would avoid this one",-1
4,"Had a very good martini at the bar to start. Four stars for the food leaning towards five. Really really good pau bhaji, awesome masala prawns, lamb biryani, and garlic naan. Our server was ok, but definitely distracted at times. I can see how a busier time could cause problems as the servers seemed to lose interest in existing tables. The little spiel at the beginning about these are tapas and you should order 4 or 5 dishes for two people is a joke as three and naan is a pretty good amount of food.
Liked the atmosphere and music, very chill and inviting. Will definitely return.",1
5,"Loved this place! Great food and drinks, moderate prices, wonderful atmosphere.",1
4,"Highly rated Indian restaurant and it did not disappoint ... not like those curry houses that are selling crap and calling it Indian
The Covent Garden one is super crowded. Try the Shoreditch where is easier to walk in without reservation",1
3,"Biggest disappointment of my trip to London. Was recommended this spot by multiple people and literally every dish was under seasoned, underwhelming and overpriced.  From the hour long wait to the small portions and subpar service, this spot is definitely one to skip",-1
2,"Extremely long wait for average Indian food, and that's if they get your order right. Service is very slow. If you don't have to wait then it may be worth it.",-1
5,The lovely food and the rustic environment only complement each other at dishoom. This restaurant provides a very good overall dinner experience for any one who visits,1
4,Nice place to go for something different outside of your traditional/mass-market indian restaurant. Tasty food and good selection. Personally I wasn't as keen on the desserts! I have heard greatest things about their breakfast but am yet to try!,1
5,"Live this place, amazing vibe. We were happy to wait at the bar for a table as the cocktail list was superb. Food is fantastic, lots of small share plates so you can try a bit of everything and the traditional curries are superb too. Highly recommended!",1
4,Nice atmosphere at the bar and restaurant. Move waiters and waitresses who look like they've been kicked through topshop. Food is a expensive for what it is. Good experience overall though.,1
5,"By far the best Indian in town ( far better than expensive Umaya). We were two people and paid around forty pounds (very good for London). Their traditional beer is outstanding, we skipped appetizers and ordered; the dhal which was above average, ruby chicken which was the best Indian item and their special tikka which is perfect after you squeeze some lemon over it. Food comes spiced decently (for someone who likes very spicy it's quite something) and with three sauces. Finally the pistachio kulfi was quite something coming in a stick version. Overall great experience, portions are decent and so would advise special care when ordering so as not to over-order. I would skip the dhal as its slightly above average and take something else. Beware you ll come out smelling like curry.",1
4,"My experiences at Dishoom have run the gamut from 3 stars (my first visit) to 5 stars.
BRUNCH:
Ah, you used to be a 5 star brunch.  Don't get me wrong, it's still very good, just not quite the excellent value for money that it used to be.  I should've known when the Ginger Pig bacon naan roll was trialled that prices would be raised (£5.20 now, used to be £3.70).  It's still worth it, just less so than before.  I can't honestly remember if they're a little bigger now than they used to be, I think they are but not sure.  A few other notes - the Akuri (scrambled eggs with spices) are still tasty, but last time I went they were serving normal grilled tomatoes rather than cherry tomatoes.  It's not the same guys, sort it out.  I also used to like the Full Bombay breakfast (bacon/sausage/beans/tomato/toast), but it's steep (£11.50).  I will say that none of these things will stop me coming back, I'm very partial to the place - I really enjoy their Malabar coffee (very low acidity, very dark) and their mango/fennel lassi.  It's just not quite as wonderous as it used to be, unfortunately.  Still, if you want something a little bit (admittedly not hugely) different, then this is an excellent choice.
MAIN MENU:
My experiences of the main menu here have been quite mixed.  My first trip with a veggie friend was somewhat underwhelming considering how popular the place is - all the dishes we tried were ok, just not especially memorable.  However, I've been a few times since and there are some total gems on the menu:
i)  Bhel (starter) - I love bhel puri, and this ones a good 'un (it's a mixture of puffed rice with chopped onions and a coriander-based dressing).  It does sometimes come a liiiiittle bit soft, but the flavouring is good and comes with a nice topping of pomegranate seeds.  Moreish.
ii)  Chicken & pomegranate salad - this is delicious, a large plate with a generous helping of well spiced chicken, coriander dressing, and pomegranate seeds. Really good balance of flavours and textures, nice and tangy.
iii)  Chicken ruby - so buttery and tangy and delicious.  Definitely one of my favourite curry dishes I've had of late.  Nothing with this much butter in it can be bad.
The breads are also all very good (as are the accompanying sauces - I particularly like the chilli one).  A lot of my friends are very fond of the black daal. I like how buttery and thick this one is; at the same time, I find it to be lacking a little something - probably because I like my daal to be loaded with garlic.  I want it to make me stink.  This doesn't quite do that.  It's good, it's just lacking that little something to make it truly moreish.
I really like the interiors here; there's also a veranda to sit in which is nice when it's sunny outside. It's  very spacious too.  The staff are generally friendly although the service speed is pretty variable.  It gets pretty busy and things get a bit haphazard. It's surprising given how well established the place is (and should be used to high volumes of people), but it's not usually too much of an issue.  On the subject of volumes of people...evenings are mad (1+ hour waits sometimes).  Still, I will keep coming back to this place, for some reason I find it...calming?  I don't know. There's a lot to like, even with the recent changes.",1
4,"Met a friend on Shoreditch High Street for a lunch catch up and we spotted the windows of Dishoom. Intrigued we followed the signs to the entrance. We found a beautiful little oasis for an alfresco lunch. With help from the waitress, we selected various bits and pieces to share. I can't remember what the dishes were called, but I do remember the lentil dish and roti, they were divine. Will definitely be coming back for more.",1
5,"Dishoom is one of the best Indian Fusion restaurants. Remember the word fusion, and that's what makes this place absolutely unique. A hint of the retro Bombay right in the middle of a very hip Shoreditch. Every single dish we tried was absolutely delicious. It's a bummer they don't have pan (beetlenut leaf - traditional Indian refreshment) but that said this place is lovely. Do visit even if you don't like Indian food, and don't forget to order a Thumbs Up with the fried Okra to get you going.",1
4,"Not a fan of indian/spicy food, but this was good, with flavours that I never tasted. Attention was good and quick and really helped us to decide what to order. It is a bit noisy but our table was more chill.",1
4,"Ate here on a business trip with about 10 colleagues. We had reservations - and they were needed with the line out the door on a Wednesday night. Place was packed. I am not an Indian food expert but everything we had was pretty damn good. My favorites were the shrimp, and the lentils. We took a while to decide but the food came out quickly and in rapid waves. The food was gone almost as fast. Well worth a visit.",1
5,"tried all 3 dishooms, fave place was at king's cross, the biggest dishoom out of all 3 and atmosphere was awesome  overall all dishooms has great interior and also GREAT foods. must try is mattar paneer and raita with garlic naan must try chai also : bestttt",1
4,"Great cocktails and very good food. A bit spicy, but hey, it's Indian food. Long line to get in around 7pm.",1
5,"I love the Shoreditch venue! Every. Single. Time.
The overall design of the space is engaging and beautiful, imbued with humor and delightful details.  
We finally went for brunch last weekend, after friends had stated (time and again!) that it was their favourite brunch in city. Once again the food impressed me. We all had the sausage & egg naan roll and shared the yogurt & granola.  Each were absolutely delicious!  Unfortunately they were out of chai when we ordered (really??!) but if you're lucky enough to order you do get unlimited refills. 
This is the same chai they graciously serve down the line while you stand for an hour (rain or shine) waiting for your table!*
I've been for dinner several times - and at both locations - and each visit has been a great experience.  No matter who I take with me, they enjoy it too.  The staff are adept at helping to construct a table menu that is well balanced; just point out what you have your heart set on and they'll recommend other dishes to complete the meal.  I particularly love the grilled paneer skewers.
*There is always a bit of a wait, so I recommend going during the week to avoid the worst of it. You can wait in the bar on weekend mornings when you simply have to endure the crowd to enjoy the brunch, since they stop serving at noon.",1
5,"Oh, Dishoom in Shoreditch. I rarely give 5-stars but this deserves it.
Being a fan of Indian food and living in London has been quite the success for me food-wise. What else do you need other than the regular chicken tikka massala with pilau rice and some hot naan? 
London is crammed with Indian restaurants of all kind so when I first went to Dishoom, I didn't expect much.
First of all, this branch of the Bombay restaurant is in Shoreditch, a really cool neighborhood with markets, small cafés, boutiques and street art. The interior is inviting, it has a vintage and ethnic vibe fused with modern chic, and the verandah is to die for.
Even though they take reservations, they reserve half their tables for walk-ins, and although you might have to wait on a packed Saturday night, you are guaranteed a spot, which is rare in London have you not booked in advance.
The staff was very helpful, giving recommendations on portions and flavours, what goes with what, etc. 
We were three and ended up getting exactly as much as we could eat, which was marvelous. The potatoes were outstanding, as were the curries. The chicken tikka was not as good as expected, but was still fine.
What I liked most is that although this place serves authentic Indian food, it fuses its tastes with other Asian cuisines and creates perfection. The prices are pretty good as well. Overall, bringing each and every one of my friends to Dishoom:)",1
4,"I wasn't that impressed when I went to the Covent Garden locale for lunch.  But I loved the Shoreditch locale for dinner.  The space is amazing--even the outdoor line that we waited on to get in.  Arriving at 7 on a Thursday with a group of 5 was a 1.5 hour wait.  But after 25 minutes and a small complementary Bombay Pimms we were in the bar.  They manage how many people can get into the bar area so it isn't too crowded.  We had great cocktails and a few appetizers to tie us over until we got to our table.  
The decor makes you feel like you have been transported and the food is really good.  The Black Dahl is amazing although it has more butter and/or cream than you can possibly imagine.  We enjoyed a variety of dishes and everything was good and we drank interesting cocktails. 
Service was good.
Be forewarned--it is a noisy bustling place AND our waiter told us to order about 15 dishes (3 per person).  I think we ordered about 10 and were stuffed, so don't over-order!",1
3,"We lucked out and got a table immediately, had prompt service and were all wowed by the quality of the food. Coming from eating Spanish food for four months, my friends and I were in need of some spices. I had the mutter paneer which was fantastic. The food had the perfect amount of spice. The portions looked small at first glance, but the four of us left satisfied!",-1
5,"great food - a superb salad with greens, mango and cheese slices, a nice rumali roti, a kaali daal and an awadhi lamb biryani to die for.",1
3,"Come here for the atmosphere, the drinks, the cheer. The music is authentic too. All staff and management are extremely nice. The Indian food is all right. However, If you're vegan avoid this establishment. There is a pdf menu online. Check it out.  Prices are reasonable.",-1
5,Really fantastic atmosphere with delicious food and cocktails. Not as spicy as I expected but still really tasty.  It looks like a more expensive place than it actually is and we found it be great value.  Long queue if you've not booked and the bar was really packed but I'd say it's worth the wait and the squeeze to get a table!,1
5,"Excellent meal..  Didn't know what to expect but definitely not your typical curry in a hurry.  Chic dining room, cool vibe.  Waitress was super friendly, attentive and knowledgable.
Best description would be Indian tapas.  Everything is made to share and super tasty.
Highlights were the chili cheese toast, the lamb kabab and the daal.  Would definitely gone back often if I actually lived in London.",1
4,"Very good Indian place: clean, close-enough-to-authentic, and you don't walk out smelling like you've been sitting in a kitchen all day (especially if you're wearing a sweater that day). Chai is good, but pricey. And their wifi is called ChaiFi (super clever name, but didn't work that well when we went).",1
5,"Great vibe, excellent service and tasty food. We did have to wait about 20 minutes for a table on a busy Thursday evening but complimentary drinks were offered before we were led to the bar to wait for our table. We had a bottle of Pinot Grigio, a Bombay martini and a chili martini. All were very good. Once we were seated, we also tried the Dishoom beer which was very good. 
Along with a number of items, the standout dish was the lamb which was falling off the bone delicious. 
Decor is authentic and reminiscent of the old Parsi cafés in Bombay/Mumbai.",1
4,"Dishoom was my first time eating Indian cuisine.  I really enjoyed the food and the idea of having a lot of small plates to share.  I went with one other friend and we ordered 4 different dishes and it was more than enough.
We got the Bhel which was delicious but has a lot of heat so only order if you love spicy food.  My favorite dish of the night was the Mattar Paneer- a lot of flavor and a nice kick.  
Definitely worth a visit, great ambiance, service and food.",1
4,"First went there with several friends and I have been going back a few times since whenever I want India food. It is not very traditional, which is probably why I like it, and the food tastes simply delicious. They offer a huge variety of grilled and curry dishes and Biryani. I especially like the lamb kabab, paneer Tikka and the house specialty of spicy daal. I crave the mango Lassis here and can just have a whole meal of it. They also have a very nice outdoor area for you to enjoy delicious food and soak up the sun.",1
5,"Brunch! So good. We had the bacon naan roll, chai, chili cheese toast, and keema. All were delish. Definitely come again!",1
1,"I was sorely disappointed by my visit here... If you read my review of the Covent Garden branch you'll see I like the place and perhaps I had high hopes but the only redeeming feature of the shoreditch branch is the gorgeous waiting staff... The food was bad. Flavourless drivel that I didn't even want to finish. I tried a number of dishes collectively with my friends but none of the were notable for anything but how bad they were. I won't be coming here again, which is a shame really as it reflects badly on the other place. If you want the nice atmosphere go to Covent Garden. If you want a better curry than this one, you can get one in the cold food aisle of your nearest Tesco.",-1
5,"This is one of my favourite spots in London. Amazing food, morning or evening, with great staff and decor. Invite a bunch of friends and I guarantee you'll have an awesome night.",1
3,"Visiting this Indian tapas place today for dinner. A lot of has been said about Dishoom, and many reviewers have praised the food, while the food was good I found the place to be a little too busy and warm for a June afternoon. The cocktails were average at best and the service while friendly, seemed a little bit scatty. The lamb chops and tarka dhall were delicious as were the Bombay potatoes and biryani dishes. i'd go again, as it's easy and convenient and the food is of a good standard, overall a good experience..",-1
4,"Came here for dinner with the family. The food was generally excellent though the service, surprisingly bad. They clearly are trying to cater to a hip crowd -- and trying too hard. 
The service was thoroughly inauthentic. Our waitress was pushy, trying to upsell nearly every item. My 9 year old daughter just wanted water. Waitress insisted on lassi. My daughter insisted on Neebu Pani. My daughter finally relented after multiple times saying she just wanted water. The Neebu Pani was way too bitter for her -- and the waitress did not inquire, let alone apologize for being so pushy. This was the entire meal -- we were a family of 4. We ordered 3 appetizers and 4 main dishes and 2 side dishes...and the waitress battered us to order more. It was all too much. 
The food was superb but the service, crappy. If you can tolerate bad service, worth going to this place.",1
3,"Dishoom has opened down the street and going by my first visit there tonight that is a cause for celebration.  Inside it's relaxed and surprisingly spacious  : carefully old- fashioned with dark wood, bentwood chairs and ceiling fans - bit self-conscious but not annoyingly so. I could have done with fewer of the mock-cute Indian-style signs but maybe that's because I get to see enough of them in India. And anyhow, it's the food that matters, and this was by and large terrific... Try the crispy deep-fried okra, and an extraordinary version of the Welsh rarebit (chilli-ed and yummily runny),  really nice chunks of grilled paneer and marinated peppers. Next time I'll give the veg samosas a miss (undistinguished) but all the rest really hut the spot. Shabash!",-1
4,"Great food in a trendy and classy setting. The lamb chops were amazing, but then so was everything else. Imagine the juiciest chicken tikka, the most delicate naan and the crispiest samosas you've ever eaten. Then go to Dishoom and eat what you have just imagined. Get there early mind you, as it's a popular place and they don't reserve tables for less than 6 people for dinner.",1
5,Came back another time with my hubby. Food was awesome. Service was super fast.  Can't wait to come back again!,1
4,"We live almost literally across the street, so excited to have this in the neighborhood.  They're having a soft opening this week, so any bumps were easily excused (not that there were many).  I've also been to the one in Soho.  
It's good.  Everything is very tasty.  But almost every dish seems to go for the REALLY REALLY BIG FLAVOUR so dinner is a bit of an exercise in endurance.  The whole lamb shank is expensive (and was too salty) but there's a good concept in there.  The lamb chops were good (but not as good as Tayabs).  Daal was delish.  Paneer was fine.  The three or four other dishes were worthy.  Very impressed with some of the more unusual desserts.
But there's also something that bothers me about how high concept it is.  I'm convinced it was started by two Goldman bankers from India here in the UK who came up with a concept they could replicate in Qatar, NY and Rio.  
But tasty nonetheless.  And half off during this week's soft launch!
UPDATE:  I WAS WRONG ABOUT GOLDMAN SACHS.  FOUNDER IS EX-BAIN.",1
4,"The place has a good vibe. Food is decent more authentic than other Indian restaurants in London. Butter chicken was really tender, chai was awesome, same goes for the pav bhaji. The samosas were bit of a let down but that's a minor gripe and the espresso more than made up for it.",1
4,"Really delicious, interesting, flavorful food--too bad about the snotty front desk staff who was so painfully slow to seat us (and nasty while doing so) during a chilly, brisk day when all we wanted was to hang our faces over a nice bowl of something warm and aromatic! 
Stay away from the regular curries you're used to and order everything else--you won't regret it and if you want confirmation, order a curry and you'll see it's the only thing left over while every morsel of dal, biryani and [___insert all other items on the menu__] is GONE at the end of your meal!",1
4,Food was great and the service was good. I would highly recommend for anyone looking for an Indian dinner.,1
4,"Gerrard Street is where the real Chinatown restaurants are.  (The tourist traps are a block over on Lisle Street.)  This one is said to be renowned for its bbq duck, though I noted that a number of its neighbors also featured that prominently.
What's great about it here is that, if you're a solo diner, you can get a small quantity.  There is, for instance, a lunch rice plate that comes with 1-3 bbq meats of your choice.  I found the duck excellent, juicy and crunchy without being in the least bit gamy as duck often is.  I also had spareribs which were a little dry.",1
1,"The worst service one can possibly have. It's hard to fathom how such customer service can suffice in this day and age. Have it enough chances, think they don't deserve another. Essentially not only do they rush you to order, they also kick you out before you even finish your food.
Food is just a 3 star I'd say. Not bad but nothing outstanding. Price is high however and way to high for the service they provide.",-1
5,"Hubby and I were hungry and happen to be by Chinatown around dinner time one night in London so we stopped in here after seeing a long line here the night before . We wanted to see what the hype was. We noticed they have multiple locations with the first being open since 1990, so we knew the food had to be good. I also double checked on Yelp and noticed most of the bad reviews were non-Asian or complaints about the restaurant, service, or tip. Aka, good food? Im down! 
The entrance and ground floor is tight but we managed to be lead upstairs to our table. I am glad they gave us a bigger table for our winter jackets, shopping bags, and room for the food we ordered. 
We asked what were some of the best sellers and ordered two dishes to share. Plus an appetizer of xiao long bao. 
The xiao long bao was meh, skip it. 
We also ordered the crispy aromatic duck and lobster. The duck was extremely good. The lobster as quite good as well, but not a good as impressive as the duck. The duck I highly recommend getting when visiting here. Next time I will get the traditional roast duck as it has been deemed by the Financial Times as ""the best roast duck in the world"" lol. That probably means at least in the UK it is the best. 
The waiter does speak Chinese and English so no worries if you cant speak Chinese. 
This place is pretty traditional from the food to experience. Dirty, small, dingy restaurant. Waiter is pushy and cranky (what Chinese adult/parent isnt lol). Plating is traditional (plopped on a plate lol). Table side service for the duck. The only thing I didnt do is get a hot bowl of water to clean my utensils lol. 
You do have to pay for rice and water. Oh, and I think I spotted 20% automatic tip. 
*For my fellow Chinese : Every Chinese person is showing face so wear nice clothes- service is better then - hint hint. 
This place offers great authentic Chinese food. Get off the high horse and get passed the ambiance/cleanliness, plating, service, cost, etc. and enjoy the good food they have to offer. Its good. It why you go to a restaurant at the end of the day....to eat. Visit and enjoy the Duck!",1
3,"This is a small shop located across Bubblewrap and every time we walked by, their were little to no customers around. I personally feel like this place is more authentic than the other places on Chinatown which may account for why it lacks popularity.
The person who served us was relatively polite and nice but one of the ladies working was pretty rude to us. 
We ordered beef noodle soup, fried rice, Chinese spinach, and seafood soup. The fried rice was good as was the spinach. The noodle soups were just ok and were not anything special.
Overall, this was a subpar place and I probably wouldn't go to it again. It wasn't awful but it wasn't great.",-1
5,"Hands down the best roast duck in London, it's a must try. However, the roast duck is a bit high in terms of fat content, may not be to everyone's liking.",1
2,"I just had dinner with the family here at the Four Seasons for Mother's Day. So first of all, I want to apologize to my mom for taking her here. Our dishes were extremely greasy and salty. I understand that a little use of oil prevents stickiness in the pan but when the vegetable dish is greasier than the meat dish then there's a problem. The couple things that were passable was the steam rice and BBQ pork. The chow fun was drenched with a very salty gravy. I think my doctor would recommend me to stop dining here. 
Also the men's toilet is the smallest one I've been to. How small is it? Imagine sharing an airplane bathroom with another person. I swear while I was peeing I was rubbing shoulders with the man in the next stall and rubbing cheeks with another man washing his hands. Intimacy is good sometimes but not in the toilet. 
After the meal there is complimentary orange slices and mint for your stinky breath. They also add a 12% service charge to your bill.",-1
1,"When I arrived, I hear people speaking Cantonese so as a Cantonese speaker I speak to the guy up front in Chinese only to be met with gruff, broken English. We are sat and given water but had to ask for tea at $1.50/pp. When it came time to place our order I asked again in Chinese for 1/4 duck, chicken satay appetizer and the braised beef wonton noodles.
The chicken came out first and then the noodles without the beef. I looked confused and said I ordered the beef one. One of the waitresses offered to switch it but I said it was fine. What bothered me was that waiter was adamant that I was wrong. He protested in Chinese ""I'm not wrong! She didn't order that!!!"" Soooooo when I speak in Chinese you pretend you don't know any but when something is wrong you complain in Chinese?? What great customer service...
The wonton noodles were soggy and an off putting grey color. It's as if the noodles were pre cooked and just left out - the noodles were still sticking together in clumps in the hot broth. 
The duck was extremely dry and I was insulted that they would serve it. We were basically given shredded scraps (see pic). Had I not slathered the pancake with hoisin sauce, it would've been inedible. 
The chicken satay was decent from the one bite I tried but still fairly dry.
This establishment provides better service to non-Chinese clientele from what I saw when I was there. 
Also, I think they sensed I was annoyed and they automatically charged  20% tip to our check under ""Discretionary"" even though we were just a party of 2. What crappy business practices!!!!!",-1
5,"Surprisingly great food in London's Ctown, a place packed with pretenders.
We followed where other Chinese went.  The restaurant looked crowded with locals.  They spoke Cantonese.  All good signs.
The duck was as good as advertised.  A must, really.  They'll hack it off the bone for you, but that's a very un-Chinese thing to do.  Our other dishes were just as good (Peking-styled ribs, basic stir fry dishes).  Price was pretty good for London.  Service was typically Chinese (mostly good), but we're used it.",1
3,"Overrated restaurant. The food is just like at your average Chinatown eatery - greasy, nothing innovative (at least as per the menu), and so is the service - kind of brusque. Go to a 'premium' dim sum place, a new, higher-quality restaurant (like Xu), or just limit yourself to something simple (like green vegs or dumplings soup).",-1
1,"Lousy service.  The food was ok.  There were small portions, and soup was cold!  On top of that Unfriendly waitresses.  We came all the way from Los Angeles to try the Chinese food in London Chinatown.  Kind of disappointed in this place...",-1
3,"A little wait time, hot and sour soup was pretty vinegary and steamed shrimp dumplings were missing some flavor but customer service was pretty good during bank holiday",-1
1,"We came at 9:56pm, the restaurant is serving the guests inside but they refused to serve more even they open until 11:30pm, just say no and without telling me why.",-1
3,"Duck, soy chicken, crispy pork--- those are all you need to know. On my trip to London, I came back here twice because my boyfriend and I wanted more! We opted for the three meat plate each time and it was plenty of food to share. Their duck was juicy and not too fatty. I don't think it was a life changing dish but it was solid. What we really enjoyed, surprisingly, was their soy chicken. It was moist and had just a hint of flavor from the soy sauce. Their crispy pork was also solid and a nice textural difference to have. 
As for their other options, we were not impressed. We also tried their Peking style duck which was too dry and was definitely not worth the price. It honestly tasted like it was sitting out for too long. Their calamari wasn't special and was overcooked. I don't even really remember the other dishes we tried because they weren't that good.",-1
4,"An truly fine local favorite. 
Meandered in as a lost tourist and found the food reminiscent of that in Southern California 626 area. 
The duck is an absolute must. Tender, flavorful and perfectly balanced. While in most Cantonese joints, non speaking guest will often get the ""bad pieces"" Four Seasons knows no such concept and every single piece was fantastic and no survivors were left on our plate. For our family of four, the half portion did just fine.
During your menu selection be sure to look around at what the locals are eating, we did so and were not disappointed",1
3,"Four Seasons not to be mistaken for the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel chain, unfortunately did not make four stars during my visit.
Luckily for us,  a table for two in the center of the main restaurant was available immediately for seating during dinner. (I consider this the best seats in the house) Perfect view and access for service and visibility.
Access to the restaurant is conveniently located near the main entrance gate to chinatown.
The restaurant is old, as expected. Not a place you want to take someone on for a first date and might be difficult for groups larger than a party of four.
The food was decent but we ordered the aromatic crispy duck instead of what we were craving for, the Roasted Peking Duck.
What was ordered:
Peking Set Meal A
106 Minimum For 2 Persons (2人以上) £20.50 per person
酸辣湯 Hot and Sour Soup ,, (uniquely added fishcake, tasty)
酥炸香酥鴨 Aromatic Crispy Duck (good enough for two as suggested)
乾炒牛肉絲 Deep Fried Crispy Shredded Beef with Chilli , (not authentic)
宮保肉丁 Diced ""Kong-Po"" Pork , (Can't taste the pork, too much batter)
清炒雜菜 Stir Fried Mixed Vegetables (Good)
蛋炒飯 Egg Fried Rice (Good)
Value is filling but I recommend you order from the a la carte section.
This is probably not my first choice to return but they do offer many selections for duck.
What you need to know:
- There are three locations, two in Chinatown 
- Tea is charged
- Three levels 
- Understand the cooking method of duck you want to eat: Roasted Cantonese BBQ style, Roasted Peking Duck or Aromatic Peking Crispy Duck 
- Take time to look through the menu before ordering",-1
4,"I like the Four Seasons.
Always packed, always a queue wating outside and always a lot of chinese guests.
The roast duck, cantoese duck, BBQ Ribs and soy chicken are delicious. 
The prices are moderate but they charge a compulsory service charge.
Service is chinese style, not overfriendly but efficient.",1
4,"--- American Tourist ----
**** This is review of ""Little four seasons"" on 11 Gerrard St., next door!!! ****
It belongs to the same owner AND the food is the same AND service is a lot better!!!!! Alert!!! 
We had roast duck, Japanese creamy  BBQ ribs, wonton, first class taste, first class temperature, excellent service! Even the waitress told us that they belong the same owner AND  they know the next door has worst service. Just don't get it!?
That said, venue still tight, bathroom is not handicapped friendly! 4 Stars!
11 and 12 on the same street, just like twins but very very different personalities.
Walk into the right one, buddy!",1
3,"Crispy fat juicy duck FTW! The duck is worth the queue. If you ain't a duck fan you have other alternative dishes that are equally tasty, but then you'd be wasting your time. I had some friends telling me that it was OK, I think the duck quality varies. I got lucky with mine. I'd skip the crispy pork belly and just go try something else.
It's probably a little pricey for my liking but they're portions are huge and generous. If you're in groups of 3-4, make a booking because this place is packed.",-1
5,"I come here regularly for the Cantonese roast duck. Always delicious (and you can get it boneless which makes it infinitely easier to eat).
I didn't used to like squid until I had the salt and pepper squid here. So light and yummy, and not at all rubbery (I tried this dish a few times on my recent visit to Hong Kong and I maintain that Four Seasons does it better).
Service isn't exactly delightful, but it is efficient (although I have turned up with a few people drunk once and we did manage to crack a smile from our waitress).",1
2,"For an early dinner, this place is OK in parts and terrible in others.
They're famous for their duck, so we had that with rice and crispy pork. Another of the same, plus chicken. Then 3 starters, meat spring rolls, salt and pepper ribs and dumplings.
The rice was a decent portion but the sauce that was wrongly sweet. The duck was OK, the pork was delicious and the chicken came with no skin, no bone and the spring onion came ontop of the duck! Why?? Plus the overall meat portion was small. 
The starters were appalling and clearly aimed at an unassuming audience who wouldn't know better. The ribs were bone dry and bland, the dumpling skin was thick and fried, but not in the way you'd want. The spring rolls were supposed to be 2 large pork ones but ended up being 4 small ones with non-existant chicken. 
Overall, I'd cone back for their expensive rice dishes if I had no other choice, but the starters were awful. Our waiter was ok but I heard one say ""everyone's tastes are different"" when being asked about portion sizes and what they would recommend.",-1
4,"The name and address threw off the cabby for a minute. It's not the ""Four Seasons"" we normally think of. I was with a coworker and we were looking for something we didn't have locally. It was time for Duck that wasn't Americanized.
To start we have the best Hot and Sour soup we've ever had. What a great start. Among a couple other dishes we ordered the whole duck. We should have only gotten the half duck. There was a LOT of it. It was very good.
It's unfortunate Chinese is going through a down period in so many markets because it's not all the generic meat and veg in a brown sauce when done right. They did it right tonight.",1
4,"People come for the duck so get the duck. It's consistently rated as the best in London and we got the boneless Cantonese duck which was very tasty. Also had the pork belly, morning glory & a shrimp fried rice. Food was very good and service was what you would expect in any Chinese restaurant in the Western Hemisphere. The wait was about 30 minutes, which was reasonable.",1
5,"One of the best Chinese meals I ever had, can't believe it does not have higher reviews online.  I came for the duck and it was better than I expected.  There are multiple duck options but ordered the half Cantonese duck, seemed to be on the page that they were highlighting.  It was fantastic.  Crispy skin, meatier than expected and in a soy based sauce they really highlighted the duck.
I also ordered the two BBQ meat combo, with char sui and pork belly.  Both were great.  Char sui was flavorful.  Pork belly was not too fatty and the crispy parts were awesome (it was all tasty).
I also ordered a vegetable by pointing to a picture as I figured I needed something other than meat.  I wish they had smaller portions (of vegetables) but even it was very good, very garlicky and tasty.  
Overall, loved it and one of my favorite Chinese meals ever.",1
5,The food is good especially the lotus stems and shrimp stuffed mushrooms The seafood and tofu hot pot is delicious.,1
3,"We were in Piccadilly Circus, and decided to swing by Chinatown for our first dinner of the night (yes... vacation means food marathon). Four Seasons was recommended to us by a friend for good crispy duck. There was also a message posted on the window that said ""best roast duck in the world"", so we came with rather high expectations. Arrived around 7pm on a Sunday and the restaurant was very busy. There was not enough space to wait inside so we had to wait outside the door.
After a 15 minute wait, we were seated downstairs, which was a bit cramped and dingy. We ordered the half Roasted Duck and Oyster Pancake. The Roast Duck was good - the meat was tender and juicy, but the oyster pancake was pretty tasteless. Prices were standard Chinatown.
Service was brisk and adrupt - normal for Chinese Restaurants so I had no complaints. However, we did ask for oyster sauce for our oyster pancake, but the waitress gave us Chili Oil. Maybe oyster sauce is more of a US thing and they don't have it in London?",-1
3,"Came here late around 9pm on a Sunday to celebrate Chinese New Year and feast on some food after a few beers locally. As with most Chinese restaurants don't expect great customer service. It's not their forte. Though you will get service charge added, so expect that.
We got the roasted duck, which it is famed for. I had many recommendations that this was THE place to get duck from in Chinatown. A whole one of course. They had unfortunately run out of crispy pork belly (another rec), so we settled from BBQ pork which was really good.
The duck was good. Fatty, juicy, though we kept it on the bone for flavour and this meant it was awkward to eat into. Duck is hard to cut like this, so the pieces er eaten eaten whole or bitten using hands.
Very nice overall.",-1
3,"Roast duck is a must and is the only saving grace of the meal! Everything else was ordinary and meh.  Veggies were greasy and my friend felt sick after. This is definitely a legitimate Cantonese restaurant, though. 
I've had better elsewhere and for less £",-1
1,"Came here after recently seeing Jay Rayner live, where he recommended Four Seasons in London, in particular because it apparently has the best roast duck in the entire UK.
Arrived here with no booking, but the place wasn't too busy, so they directed us to go and take a seat upstairs.
So off we popped, upstairs, into what can only be described as a storage area of the restaurant that just so happened to have some tables and chairs sitting about in it. 
Not a great impression, but we were there for the food, willing to sit in any condition to taste this supposedly incredible duck.
It arrived luke warm, there was a LOT of fat (I know duck is very fatty, but this was a bit much), the skin was just soft and limp, the duck itself was moist and very tasty but unfortunately this didn't make up for the rest of the failings.
Not cheap either! 
Wouldn't recommend. Terrible service, terrible atmosphere if you're sitting upstairs, not great food, go elsewhere.",-1
5,"The food was delicious. We're from Markham, Ontario, Canada where we have excellent and authentic Chinese restaurants. The food at this restaurant is very comparable. The beef in black bean sauce on ho fun noodles was really good. The vegetables with garlic were excellent too.",1
1,"While the roast duck was flavorful, the skin was soggy (major no-no in any Chinese kitchen) and the dish of 3 BBQ meats was altogether cold. Our aubergine vermicelli was cold as well and over cooked. 
Originally I thought to myself, do not judge them too harshly, after all I just came back from a year living in China. But the last straw was when they grossly overcharged us. The meal should have been 21 GBP, but I later discovered my date was charged 40 GBP! I am going back with the receipt.
Utterly unprofessional and disappointing. I could have bought 4 whole Peking roast ducks of the best quality elsewhere.",-1
4,"PROS - When I was little, I was allergic to duck. I would break out in hives all over my face, arms and legs. My mom told me I would just keep eating and didn't care. Thank goodness I'm no longer allergic but even if I was, the crispy roast duck pancakes served here would encourage me to keep eating regardless. The three of us ordered the duck pancakes with a half duck and salt&pepper tofu (beancurd). The duck pancakes were delectable! The half duck was served in shreds to make it easier on us to make our own pancakes with cucumber strips and onion strips. We were given the duck sauce (looks like BBQ sauce) along with a trio of spices to fully customize our heavenly duck experience. 
The salt&pepper tofu was alright, but it was nothing special so I wouldn't order it again. 
CONS - It's a bit spendy for the amount of duck you get but Four Seasons know they are hot shit compared to other roast duck places around Chinatown so they are ""entitled"" to price their duck that way ;) So the problem lies solely with me and that I should get a higher paying job to eat more duck pancakes, dammit!",1
1,"I just want to say, WHAT?!
This place is bad, and not the kind of super-cheap-chinese-restaurant-bad, it is just plain bad. The interior and decoration is disgusting, everything is old and covered in dust. The table I sat at was slanting so much that I felt sea-sick, it was slanting so much that it felt like I was in some kind of fun house at Disney land. But the worst part was that they did all the dishes behind me, yes right over my shoulder. The sound of plastic dishes clashing together was not pleasant at all. And when I thought it couldn't get worse, I saw the waitress drop and pick up clean dish from the dirty floor and put it back on the ""clean"" pile again.
And then again when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I got the most grumpy and angry looking waiter in the world, the only thing he said throughout my experience was ""what do you want"" and ""thank you"" (when we paid). Everything was rushed, the food came out fast but so did the check.
The food was very bland/bad, everything was off, the char siu I ordered tasted like hot dog! But hey! the famous duck tasted OKAY!
I do not recommend this place at all!",-1
3,Went here for lunch and got half soy chicken rice and Malaysian ho fun. The food was decent and I have no complaints except they charge for Chinese tea which should be a staple. They were also skimpy with the rice and charged a ridiculous price for white rice - over £3 per cup.,-1
5,"Loved the food , 5 stars. Service was slightly pushy. Overall wonderful dining experience.",1
5,"You don't go to Four Seasons for the service or the ambiance, you go to eat delicious roast duck. The service is not great and the restaurant is rather dingy, now let's move on.
The food is fantastic. Three of us split the crispy aromatic duck, Peking short ribs, and softshell crab, and were absolutely exquisitely stuffed by the end of the meal. Everything was delicious but the duck stole the show- it was incredibly flavorful and the combination of cucumbers and sauce on the thin little pancake was out of this world. The food here is absolutely fantastic- just manage your expectations about the service, and you will love it.",1
2,"We traveled from the United States to London in one week ago, and we had a dinner at Four Seasons.  We only tried one Chinese restaurant in London during this trip, so I am not sure the quality of Chinese food in other restaurants in London.  This restaurant is definitely not recommended because the food and the service were really bad. 
1.  This restaurant has minimum cost for every person ($8), and the waiter will force you to order more if you didn't order enough food.
2.  This restaurant will charge you tip automatically.
3.  The service was really bad, the attitude of the waiters were the worse that I have ever seen in my life.
4.  The flavors of the food were bad, the portions were small for that price.",-1
3,"This one was recommend by my friend as one of the best places in London for Chinese food. We visited here at approximately 7:30pm and there are already a lot of customers in here. We got 3 main dishes, 1 fried rice and 1 appetizer for 3 people, and the size of the main dishes are as little bit small. The one with eggplant was good and it also has fish in it.
Of course, they are famous for roster duck but we tried their fried pork and duck, which is also really good.
If you want some authentic Cantonese good in London, try this one. The waitresses are also from Hong Kong lol",-1
5,"One of the best roast duck dishes I've ever had. We arrived around 8pm on a Sunday night. Pity they ran out of the roast pork as we heard it was delicious too. We ordered a whole roast duck (£24), sliced beef (which was savory and slightly sweet, but so juicy and delicious), choi sum vegetables stir fried with garlic, tofu with prawn stuffing, and a herbal pork soup with black and white pepper which was a milky white color because of the carnation milk they added (we took a chance with the soup because it was so cold and we were so glad we did, it was so yummy and helped clear out my sinuses).  The total bill was around £100 but the food was amazing,  definitely one of the best I've ever had from both the U.K., and the USA.  The restaurant was fairly old and small even though it has two floors. We sat in the first floor and there were 6 tables. The staff was incredibly attentive. When we arrived, they took a few minutes to set up a table for us (3 adults and a toddler) and the toddler seat was set up before we even asked for one.  Once, we had dropped a chopstick, and the owner (manager?) immediately  grabbed us a new pair of chopsticks. When all our dishes arrived, our table was quite crowded and they quickly lifted up the extension of the table and gave us more space.  The staff spoke both Cantonese and Mandarin and I felt completely at ease conversing with them in Cantonese as they were extremely friendly and customer oriented. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for amazing Cantonese food. They also own ""Little Four Seasons"" which was more on the main side of Gerard Street but I have not yet tried it.",1
4,Super nice service or because I'm Chinese too? We had the combo of meats and it was delish! Oh you get oranges after the meal. :),1
5,"Definitely a 5-star experience.  My friends had been raving about the roast duck from the moment we started our Channel crossing on the Eurostar train, and I was thinking: how good can duck be?  Turns out it was so good that I dragged them back for a second round of duck in our 4 days in London.
The duck (GBP22) was suitably tender and well flavoured, and the gravy complemented the taste well.  Other dishes were typical Chinese fare that was above average.  We ordered 2 types of Chinese soups that were typical standard for Europe: barely passable but that's so not the point of being here.  
The staff were somewhat curt but very efficient.  They managed to quickly get us a seat on the ground floor (important as a friend was hobbling with a walking stick) when we walked in on a Sunday afternoon.  The queue on Wednesday dinner was long but we solved the problem by ordering out - the main thing we were interested in was the duck anyway.  
Stood eating on the streets before our theatre show (restaurant is walking distance to many musical/ theatre venues), and decided there and then that ""duck followed by theatre"" shall be part of my next London routine.",1
3,"I would put this place in the catagory of ""another Chinese restaurant in China town"" in general pretty unremarkable. The food was ok, the service was what you learn to expect in many ""Chinese restaurants in China town"" - sit, eat, leave.... The latter at their insistence. 
It's supposed to be well known for their duck, it's not my dish of choice but I tried it and it was good (very fatty, but I hear that's the best part). 
The restaurant is of a  reasonable size and they maximize the number of seats which means your pretty close to the next table. 
My personal opinion is the best Chinese restaurants aren't in China town, but for quick eats this place meets the requirements.",-1
5,"Since there were mixed reviews on the duck by yelpers from HK and LA, we just asked them if they could make ""fire duck rice noodle"" instead. It's a good bowl of noodles when it's cold outside and you had enough of ""ghost people"" food and want some ""people eat gei food."" The soup is a bit heavy with star anise so be prepared. 
We also ordered the ""pig stomach chicken pot."" This hotpot was very heavy with white pepper so be prepared your throat will burn. It's a good dish for the cold winter though. 
Also, this place was crowded with tourists so we went to the modern looking one next door which bears the same name and serves the same duck. Much more quiet and better service there.",1
1,"The worst service I've ever encountered!  Not only did they charged us for food we didn't ordered, but they cursed us out in Cantonese when we told them about food we didn't received!  When we complained about the service, they threw the change on the table and said bye bye, in a nasty, condescending way. Don't come here!",-1
3,"Hearing reviews that this place was known for their duck, we made a specific trip to Chinatown to experience it for ourselves. Unfortunately, it felt like another restaurant at any Chinatown where the food was bland and just average.
Our main dishes were the Roast Pork/Pork Belly, BBQ Pork, Roast duck. All the food was served at room temperature. We had some greens but nothing spectacular or memorable.
Maybe it is a London Chinatown practice, we were shocked to be charged GBP 2.5 for a bowl of rice. Given we ordered 5 entrees, we assumed that we would get a bowl per entree and were disappointed when our bill arrived.",-1
1,"We visited tonight (Friday 16th March) at around 7PM in a group of 7, having heard so much about the famous duck. I was well aware the place was run down, however didn't mind if the duck was as good as was said.
We purchased a whole peking duck (£38) and several other side dishes (Fried rice, Sweet & Sour chicken etcetera). The waitress was very rude from the off, asking us what we wanted after literally only just sitting down. When she did take our order she was very blunt which set the precedent for the rest of the night.
On arrival we all remarked how little meat there was on the duck and even double checked it was in fact a whole duck, to which she replied it was. The duck ended up being about 2 legs worth of (lukewarm) meat, the rest was just skin and a base of prawn crackers which were used to pad the dish out.
Waitress collected plates as people were still eating, poured most of the wine down the side of the glass/on the table, and didn't say thank you to any member of the party after paying our £170 bill.
TL;DR - Rude servers, expensive food, small portions. Would have rather paid £12 for all you can eat at any of the other generic Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.",-1
5,"""Best roast duck in the world"" by FT, and in my view, best I've had outside Hong Kong. Delicious yummy roast duck with tender meat, crispy skin well marinated with herbs, a highly recommended stop in central London near Leicester Square and West End. Casual eatery, brusque service, real attraction is the world class roast duck!",1
5,"Don't come here expecting an intimate ambience, fine dining or good service. This is simply good Chinese food cooked for those in need of a Chinese fix, which is greatly appreciated if you've lived in Europe too long. The roast duck is absolutely divine; the skin is crispy and the fat melts in your mouth. The hot plate beef - I suggest the black pepper sauce - is also recommended. Finally, you can't go wrong with some Yangzhou fried rice.",1
2,"Was pretty disappointed with our experience here. Firstly, I know a lot of Chinatown restaurants aren't pretty at the best of times, but the basement here really is pretty basic. 
Food wise, the actual food wasn't bad, although I realise now that we stupidly ordered crispy duck when we should have gone for their famous roast duck...oh well. The real problem was that should have come first but instead they brought out our brisket stew, with no rice, so it went cold while we waited. Then the pork we ordered actually arrived cold, and had to be sent back. Duck arrives at this point. We ordered more rice but that never turned up (nor on the bill, which was something). Overall, very poor service and I think that's the first time I've ever had to send something back to the kitchen to be heated. I would hesitate to come again, even though I'd like to try the proper duck!",-1
3,"Come here for the food, not for the ambiance nor for the service.
It's a great spot for a pre-theatre dinner if you order their duck.  You'll be in and out pretty quick and it's what they're famous for their duck.  Though their aubergine with minced pork hotpot and black bean beef ho fun was pretty good as well.
In terms of service, they operate like a well oiled machine. Notice the handsfree earpieces.  How many restaurants in London have you seen those in?  if everything goes well.  They'll seat, serve and get you out asap.",-1
5,"I've always been skeptical about chinatown in London when it comes to food, because I've always been let down - until last night. Oh man - this is hands down the best duck in London - crispy, yet juicy, and the sauce is insanely good. Definitely recommend. Don't go if you're looking for a romantic ambience or a trendy location - but if you want no-frills, delicious duck, then get down there. It's incredibly reasonable, too.",1
3,"Food was okay, but it was more a factory than a restaurant...
We came in about 19.10, ordered a soup and a main dish. 19.30 the bill was presented to us (which they took back with them). When i asked for the receipt i got a grumpy face and a not so friendly 'bye""",-1
1,"We were lured into this restaurant due to the number of people queuing up but we can only advise people to queue up at other restaurants. 
Terrible service. The waiters all look like grumpy teenagers who snatch the food in front of you without asking if you are finished eating!
We were two and I had finished my dish before my girlfriend but instead of waiting for my girlfriend to finish her food, they just took the food from her without asking. 
Oh, and stay away from their char siew. Only choose barbecued duck as topping, but honestly the food looked like something you could expect from a fast food joint. 
Cannot recommend! Avoid this place!
We are never coming back!",-1
3,"I went there with my family during the weekend,which is understandably busy. The food was meh. The duck is the only saving grace for the night. We asked for the green chili and the waiter came back with the regular one,and when we pointed it out,he got frustrated and told us "" I have to walk back and forth for you"", and then went on rambling in Chinese,and I didn't understand a single word. Like I don't get how that was acceptable for a waiter to be pissed at us when I was more that sure that all of us were very polite asking for thing. Still not impressed, the only thing that saved the night for me was the duck.",-1
2,"This is the most disappointing meal I've had in a while. My friend and I were looking to grab a simple dinner in Chinatown, and when I looked up restaurant reviews, they were all around 3.5 stars out of 5 and I wondered how they could have all been so poor. There is nothing that is 4 stars or above. I've been here a few times to get barbecued meat or roast duck for takeaway, which somehow always managed to set me back £10-15, but it's well regarded for having the best roast duck in London and the char siu and crispy pork belly was always solid too. It's expensive, but on the bright side it's the same price to eat in, so that is probably the best option at this restaurant. The other items on the menu were outrageously expensive - the highlight was that plates of seasonal vegetables will send you back £9, when clearly the cost at the supermarket next door would be something like £2. We got stir fried prawns with seasonal vegetables (which turned out to be broccoli, not even anything special) for £10, but at least there were prawns. We also got the crispy duck with pancakes, which was nice because we could order ¼ duck, which you can't with the Peking duck, but the crispy duck was a dry, shredded, indistinguishable version of the normal glazed and juicy roast duck glory. I wouldn't recommend it. The table next to us got the Peking duck and I had serious food envy. Our last dish was the young chow fried rice. The disappointing part about this was that it was served lukewarm. The whole meal costs us nearly £40 in total, which is terrible value and you should definitely be able to do much better in Chinatown. I might come here for the barbecued meat or roast duck takeaway, but it's not worth your while to eat in.",-1
1,We could not eat here. We saw a tray of noodles used as a door stop to an outside entrance to a walk up to sidewalk level. All the dirt and soot from the street could land on the food. Ugh.,-1
4,"Let's get this straight. Four Seasons will give you the best roast duck in the world. However I decided to give 4 stars because of their service, which should be better. 
As a student based in Leeds, I go to London from time to time to watch football, and usually before that, I would go here for lunch. 
Quite a lot of times, I went there and it's a 50/50 chance the service would be good or bad. I've had the good service twice and the
bad service twice. 
But for food, the duck is the best around. No question. The aubergine with fried pork meat is amazing. And for the price, it was worth trying. It's just that the service could be better.",1
2,"I used to here all the time for roast duck, unfortunately I think the standards here have dropped a bit.
Obviously service is never great here, so I come here just for some comfort Chinese food. I've been twice recently and the food is not as good as I remembered
Perhaps it's because I went towards the end of the night, so everyone's tired and the choice cuts of meat are gone. The roast duck I was served was extremely fatty, some pieces were 80% fat, 10% skin and 10% meat. I like fatty duck but this is pushing it a bit
Also, the egg noodles in my soup was a big block, all stuck together! I am quite sad writing this as I have no idea where else to go now!",-1
4,"If you come here I'd recommend you eat the BBQ'ed duck...I prefer it de-boned already, because that way I can indulge in it without having to suck the meat off of its natural scaffolding. I cannot say that any of the other dishes have blown me away, but typically what we order is a bunch of BBQ'ed duck (or pork), some rice (to soak up all the juices) and one or two orders of vegetable - I recommend Morning Glor, Bok Choy or Peashoots.
As for the decor and service of this establishment - this is your typical run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant with rather oblivious service and crappy decor...nothing to rave about. But I don't come here for these things...all I want is to tuck into my duck as fast as possible! 
Quack, quack...",1
3,"The food was good but the waiter had a bad attitude. We went as a group of four and when taking the order the waiter came across as quite aggressive as my friend was taking a while to choose an order from the menu (vegan). The food was good and the atmosphere here is ""cosy"", you will be more or less joined to the people on the table next to yours. We enjoyed the trip but dropped the service charge. Also notable was that I had to return a spoon as it was presented dirty.",-1
4,"Ordered duck takeaway, it was excellent as usual. Not sure why they were rated the best duck shop, but I do agree that their drippings are nicer than other restaurants. Very small but successful restaurant, gotta enjoy my dinner at home then ;)",1
2,"This place did do great Cantonese food and it's reputation in Soho and even London proceeds it,  I found this place from a top off from a chef many moon ago.... but..... 
Recently I took my girlfriend for the first time and it was a pretty good experience,  endulging in the world famous Peking duck,  crispy pork belly,  soft shell crab and yummy noodles and rice. We were seated quickly and the experience was noisy but enjoyable. But somehow the noise adds the feeling of a bustling busy restaurant which is fine... So we went back a week later. 
And.... 
I don't think a restaurant could drop the ball any further... And they weren't even as busy as usual.... Maybe that's a sign of the times. 
After 40 minutes we received our duck pancakes,  the duck was nice but seemed to be dry from sitting out too long,  then..... Nothing.... 20 mins later we received cold soft shell crab.... Ten minutes later Kung Po... Very tasty.... But cold.... No rice.... 10 mins later... Rice.... What's the point 
No apology just an interest to take money and run. Also the pricing is higher than most Chinese restaurants so we left feeling like we paid for their reputation not there service and sadly not their food. 
We won't be going back. There's plenty more tables in London serving exotic Cantonese wonderment.",-1
4,"LOVE IT HERE! The BBQ duck is so delicious, wonton soup is fab as is the sizzling filet. Service is quick, not overly friendly but efficient. Queues get really long so we always go early. China Town can be overwhelming but you can't go wrong here!",1
5,"I can image that I'll be here for lots of time in my following four years. Lovely Cantonese food that always remind me my hometown! I truly recommend this restaurant to you but please avoid a peak time, otherwise the service will be even worse :(",1
3,"The food was average in my opinion. 
Wife was craving noodles and after some really bad ramen at Wagamama (we went there because it was close to our hotel and we didn't want to travel far. Now we know to never go!) So she looked up Yelp and she decided to give this place a shot. 
We arrived before dinner rush and there were already people waiting. Since we were a small group, we were promptly seated in the basement section. My wife ordered her noodles, a tofu with veggies, the mixed plate of duck and pork. 
Its decent Chinese food. We did order the famous duck that everyone is raving about and its good - I have to give it to them, but its not ""the best I had"" kinda good. Think HK, NY, or SF! Maybe its consider the best in UK (maybe Europe)?
The pork was not as good because it got soggy from soaking in the soy sauce mixed in with the duck. The surprise was the tofu veggie that I really liked. Sorry - I don't know the official English name because the server recommended it in Cantonese. 
Anyways, I think this restaurant is decent. Wouldn't mind going back again if I was craving Chinese food in London.",-1
3,"Quite busy. I came around 9pm. If you don't come for the service, but just for the tasty roast duck. Then you'll love it :))",-1
1,"More like One Season.
I don't mind a grubby Chinatown restaurant, hell I don't even mind rude service as long as the food is good. But all of above combined left me fuming.
I visited Four Seasons on a busy Friday night with the missus and after a short wait we were seated. Not much to say about the interior or staff, so we promptly ordered our food.
Starters were brought out after the Mains. Our Roast Duck was tepid, and judging by the sauce that had dried on the plate it had clearly been sitting out far before we had arrived. When we explained that it was cold, they took it away and warmed it up in the microwave, my initial bite mark that returned with the dish proved this.
Terrible all around. Your better off ordering from your local Chinese takeaway.",-1
4,"Having spent some time in China and Hong Kong, I can honestly say this place meets the standards pretty well. It also meets the service standards, but this is the kind of place you simply go to only for the food, not necessarily for the ""restaurant-experience"" (this is not a place to dress up for a Saturday night).
Their roast duck, pork belly, soya chicken (in that order) are all fantastic, you can have a meat selection but make sure you order enough duck. We ordered the beef noodles and Singapore fried vermicelli with it and these are equally great. 
Whether you're new to the Cantonese kitchen or have high expectations, this is the place to go to!",1
4,"If I were only reviewing food I'd give this place 5 out of 5. Because without a doubt the food here is good, tasty and worth the asking price.
The main detraction however is ambience. My partner and I were sat downstairs in a small white box of a room, packed with tables and customers. This I can deal with, but when the number of patrons impacts the service I start to become wary.
My meal was excellent, tasty and felt authentic. However the venue for the meal lacked any ambiance or class.
I came here because of the good reviews, and my food lived up to them. The over-all experience though was tainted by the lack of ambience and friendly service. Don't get me wrong - the service was good. I just wasn't classy enough to make me smile.
In a nutshell, if you want tasty Chinese food in Chinatown you can get it here. If you want a more pleasing environment in which to experience it go elsewhere!",1
4,"This is my other half's favourite haunt for roast duck. It's not hard to see why as their Bayswater branch is famous for it, they have won countless awards (and glued these to their window and walls, including newspaper clippings for you to read while you wait!)
A quick summary before we begin:- If you want tasty roast duck, come here. If you want excellent service to go with it, please look elsewhere because you will not find it here.
To elaborate, the roast duck is the juiciest duck you will ever taste. Sometimes it may be overly fatty but the fat is what makes it taste so good. The soya sauce that comes with it is really sweet and I can only imagine the amount of sugar that has gone into it. However, I cannot complain as I have a sweet tooth and generous helpings of this sauce with the roast duck makes me a happy bunny.
I usually get the roast duck for takeaway to eat at home, unfortunately the price has gone up recently, it's around £18.50 for a whole roast duck. If you are ordering takeaway please ignore the queue outside and just go straight to the till to order. 
Sometimes if you come really late in the night (I actually mean 9pm) they would have sold out of roast ducks. Have no fear, they opened another branch about 3 min walk away down the end of Gerrard Street, at Wardour Street. They usually have a few roast duck hanging up even though this branch has run out.
Onto the issue of service. Inevitably you will see a queue start forming here as early as 6pm. The restaurant is tiny and there are just too many people trying to eat here all the time that you end up freezing outside while you wait. If you do manage to get a table, you will get one of these two:- get ignored by the waiter for refills of drinks, or get hurried by the waiter to pay up and leave so they can sit someone else down. If you are lucky you will get both treatments!
Tip: maybe stick with takeaways and cook your own rice at home!",1
5,Don't expect service at all. If one come for the boneless duck - one will be in heaven! Who knew duck could be so tasty and tender! Shut up and take my money even though your service sucks big time and you even charge for service.,1
4,Went to this restaurant for lunch with work. We had heard great things about the duck and rice and we all ordered this along with vegetables. Very tasty and excellent service from the staff.,1
5,"I usually give 4 stars for good restaurants but I will start giving 5 till yelp sorts it's self out with having more detailed review options as in a rating for ambiance, food and service etc. 
Now to the review call me racist but when I go to Chinese restaurants I don't have any expectations of your European standard ""good service and hygiene"" it's just a cultural thing I guess. 
But this so far is my favorite roast duck joint and has the sweet and sour chicken the other day and was great. 
Pro tip:
Was told by my old lecturer back at Uni ( he was Chinese obviously) if you want to know how good a Chinese cooks food is ask him to prepare it with out msg. So ye give it a go taste the difference. Ofc the pre made stuff can't have the msg omitted.",1
3,"Post ECC cocktails my friend and I were a little peckishand wandered right next door to the Four Seasons.
It's just your standard Chinese Restaurant, nothing special, white wall, Asian Pictures, etc...  Service was curt, food was palatable.
Energy levels restored and we stepped out into the dark and rainy night.",-1
4,"For good and well-priced Cantonese cuisine, this is the place to go. I have been here many times and have even brought my Cantonese parents when they were crazing home-cooking. 
If you're a meat fan, order the sample plate where you get the BBQ pork, soy sauce chicken, duck, and fatty pork. It's incredible... my favorite is the first three because the fatty pork can be dry sometimes. The noodle dishes (stir-fried rice noodles with beef) are a must, and their seafood (pineapple shrimp) is not bad either. 
Be wary of the waiters though because if they think you're tourists, they will try and get more tip by falsely claiming their added service charge is for the government, not for the restaurant... completely absurd. I was a bit insulted but it hasn't happened again and the food is so good, so I will definitely go back here.",1
2,"Distinctly average.
Cramped seating (downstairs anyway), average-tasting food, a bit expensive, so-so service. With so many other restaurants in Chinatown, I can't see myself coming back. My advice is to only eat here if everywhere else is full and you can't be bothered to wait.",-1
5,"Had take out as I heard that the roast duck with rice was the best here. Therefore, I walked out with that one item. 
It was amazing and the sauce was even more amazing.",1
4,I don't know about their regular menus but the duck is one of the best I've tried so far. Really really good.,1
1,"Absolutely appalling services. Will not be returning. Although the food is decent we cannot put up with the services! There were five of us and we were placed at a table for four (which is quite crowded) and we asked whether we can moved to a larger table when it was not busy and they refused with a terrible attitude. When we sat down as well, no one offer any tea or drinks to us - which is typical in a Chinese restaurant- and the attitude is horrendous. When we were ready to order the waiters just ignored us and carry on to talk instead of coming over and help us. When we trued to order more plain boiled rice, they ""forgot"" and we had to ask them again before giving us the rice. 
The most disgusting thing is that they charge a compulsory 12.5% service charge and even ask for more tips at the end. Why would we pay any tips for the appalling services they gave us?",-1
3,"I'm a huge fan of the duck which is out of this world, unfortunately the service is a hit and miss (most likely miss). Typically rude Chinese service that I expect if I am in Asia but not when I'm in London. Oh and don't bother turning up in the evening after dinner hours as the meat has gone cold and chewy.",-1
5,"On a international trip to London with my gals, we were HIGHLY recommended to go to this restaurant by an American ex-pat living in London. Many of us tried the same things, but there are some things that I have had at this restaurant that stand out as being the best Chinese I've ever had in my life. We all split the duck with the pancakes. I was quite hesitant to try duck, as I never have been fortunate enough to see this variety in my daily diet. It was amazing! The pancakes (of course, I had not known what this was since Americans have a different cultural knowledge of pancakes) complemented the appetizer so well, that I wanted more! But I'm really glad we didn't. Our main course came, and we all sampled the variety of duck and chicken in many different sauces: sweet and sour, orange, and kong-po. I know there were some other dishes that were ordered, but I do not recall at the current moment. We had visited here on our first day in London, and decided we loved it so much that we made reservations for the last day. What a great decision! When I come back to you one day, London, I will enjoy this wonderful restaurant again!",1
4,"Restaurant which specialises in Roast Duck. If you go here, you MUST have the duck. It is absolutely delicious. I like duck anyway but this is just lovely. My mouth is watering now thinking about it!
PS - I would rate this 4.5 if I could but Yelp doesnt allow half marks.
(Few days ago I wrote review for the wrong Four Seasons. Sorry about that. I have removed the other one now).",1
4,"Fending for myself on the mean streets of London for a few days, I had no idea where to go or what to eat. When I finally exhausted the recommendations of friends, I went in search of something undeniably delicious that I knew wouldn't disappoint me and I wound up in Chinatown, in a well reviewed restaurant, where they waste very little time on decor and atmosphere and they spend all their time on what's important. Roasted Duck.
Simply food. Walk in, sit down, order half a duck with white rice, sit, and feast. The skin was crispy and fatty, the meat was tender and plentiful. I could not have asked for more on a rainy London day.",1
1,Terrible service! Food wasn't delicious and even their signature roasted duck was just mediocre...wouldn't come back again,-1
5,"Roast duck. Crispy skin, fat, and juicy. Do I need to say any more?",1
4,"Oh Chinatown, no matter what city and country I'm in the service just as bad. Can't complain I suppose, although I have to admit this was the rudest asian restaurant I've ever been to. The food however makes up for most of the crappy service. I recommend the boneless ROAST DUCK. The sweet soy sauce just PERFECTION drizzled on. Every time I'm in town I stop by Four Seasons. Though, if you do takeaway they don't give you the veggies that comes with the order when you eat in :( I'm a bit sad when i found that out. If you're bringing buggies you might be yelled at since the restaurant is small, which is really RUDE. I still have to give a 4 for that duck, coz even LA's chinatown got this beat from the get go. :)",1
5,"Wondering how we missed this Chinatown gem for so many years! Missed their signature roast duck, all finished just as we arririved.  We ordered their seasonal menu and the food was delicious! I ordered frog legs with bitter melon and minced grilled pork with lotus root, hubby ordered spare ribs and conegee with pork and oyster! Shame we couldn't order more.
Portions are generous but what's the harm in getting a doggy bag to enjoy it at another meal!",1
3,"This place is known for its Roasted Peking Duck (with pancakes) and it was excellent.  The hot and sour soup was also delicious, however, the seafood udon did not have much flavor.  The service here is pretty rushed (most is in this touristy part of town).  While the duck was a bit pricey for the portion size, I'd come back again but skip the udon.",-1
4,"""Do you like duck?""  This was the question that was asked of me (quite randomly I might add) by my friend while I was visiting him in London.  I do happen to be a fan of duck, so when he recommended we go to the Four Seasons in Chinatown, I was all for it!
The place is fairly small and looks like most Chinese places I've been to.  There were seven in our group so we were sat at one of the larger tables in the back that have rotating glass in the center (very good for family style sharing).  Since my friend had been here before, we let him do most of the ordering.
We started with hot and sour soup (one of my personal favorites) which was much spicier than what I've had here in the States.  I'm a huge fan of spicy food so that was no problem for me!  We then moved into our main courses of whole roasted duck and BBQ duck, both of which were absolutely delicious.  The whole duck came with thin tortilla-like wraps that we used with veggies and sauces to make our own duck wraps.  I'm not such a fan of the BBQ duck as it's a little fatty for my liking.
We also had a shrimp dish which was pretty yummy.  For whatever reason, someone thought it would be a good idea to order Lychee wine.....yeeeaaaahhhh....not the best.  It was way too sweet, strong, and just overall not good.  Wouldn't recommend it.
For dessert we had just plain old Lychee which WAS delicious.  Those sweet little balls made my mouth very happy (that's what she said).  When you're done with your entire meal, they bring you oranges (kind of like an after dinner mint).
The service wasn't too bad.  It was a little slow at times and one of the smaller dishes we ordered never made it to our table, but they were very nice about taking it off our bill.  Overall, I would have to agree with the masses and say that they have the best duck around.",1
3,"I have to confirm that their roast duck Cantonese style is delicious. It's the their speciality here. The skin tastes good, the flesh is tender and juicy. We ordered half of a duck (£11) but we could not even finish it! Fortunately they do takeaway.
 The rest of the menu is not interesting. We had some Fu-jian rice, with carrotts, asparagus, duck and scallops; it was greasy and insipid. I would rather come back for the duck only!
 The room is clean and commonplace, the service is OK.",-1
4,"The best place we have tried on the main china town sreet so far. 
Good food, reasonable sized portions for what we paid. The service was also good. 
The duck is especially good.",1
4,"This was quite the experience!  Loved the food.  Service was spot on, if a bit brisk. Fun to watch the staff do their thing.",1
4,"I'm always a little wary of China Town which really annoys me. I think it's because I always get lost and have had one to many bad experiences of all you can eat buffets served in a trough! I want to be one of those people that can navigate themselves round windy streets and no the best place to get Crispy Duck and any time of day or night. Alas, I am not... until now. 
OK, so there wasn't much street winding going on considering Gerrard Street is the main street in China Town but none the less I am now quietly confident I can challenge any China Town veteran to the 'best duck ever' stakes. 
I came to meet my boyfriend and his Mum here, the previous night we had had a fight, now I was running late and screaming down the phone because I was lost. The ambiance was not great. No matter, once I got into the restaurant the waiters were so friendly and instinctively poured me a glass of wine that I suddenly began to feel more relaxed. 
There was no pressure to hurry in this place which I think is one of the most important things. We were able to order our Duck and starters and take our time over them. The Duck was as good as I have ever had, really meaty, we ordered a half and we got a big half! 
After a leisurely start we were obliged to order mains, even though we were actually all full. Ordered was: Mixed Seafood and Noodle Soup, I thought this tasted like pond water but everyone else seemed to like it, weird! Salt and Pepper Squid, this was amazing. Best I've had in a Chinese restaurant. The batter was really light and crispy with just the right amount of chili's, there was way to much for one person but I didn't let it stop me. There was also Sweet & Sour Pork and King Prawns with seasonable vegetables. I presume these were also both delicious as I didn't get a look in. 
For the four of us with 3 bottles of wine, duck, starters and mains it came to just over Â£100.",1
5,"i'm from a very Asian area in the USA and there are two Chinatowns near my house.  I eat Chinese food all the time, yet this is by far the best roast duck I've ever eaten.  Hands down.
duck in London is better than most other places because they are naturally leaner.  the duck was roasted well: crispy skin, scrumptious taste/barbecue, lean indeed.  the renowned sauce which is a well protected secret is the best roast duck sauce i've ever had.  it's not too salty and has a tad of sweetness to it.  the roast duck dipped in the sauce is heaven in my mouth.  the sauce over rice is also great.
the only downfall is that after a while, the duck gets really oily and the bottom of the box/plate is drenched in oil.
the barbecue pork is also extremely delicious, also one of the best i've had.  great marinade/barbecue taste.
the roast pork was slightly salty (but then again all Chinese roast pork is).  the skin had a great crunch to it.
i was vacationing in London for a few days but i had to come here twice!
i ordered the food to go both times.  the cashier/waiter was friendly and helpful the first time.  but the cashier/waitress was gruff and very rushed the second time.  but i still give this restaurant 5 stars for the best roast duck in the world.",1
4,"I've been told this is one of the best roast places in London. It is really good for roast duck and soya chicken. I've tried the crispy pork and BBQ pork too, but I have had better back home (Melbourne). That said, it is one of the best roast places in London Chinatown. I buy take away from here regularly and I've come here to eat with a group of friends a few times. It's a good place for a large or small group as you can order mains and share amongst the table.",1
4,":) 
The roast duck, roast pork, basically anything BBQ was great here. Came here for lunch and dinner and both times I left super full. 
Must try the duck, but I preferred the pork. It was great and so was the service. The prices were decent and the seating was ample. One of my favourites in Chinatown and the host is friendly.",1
4,"Came here for dinner the other day and gotta say, the food was quite good. Had the duck which was really tasty and the meat was really tender. Also had some veggies (up to standard with most Chinese restaurants!) and a fried tofu dish. The food was great and by the time we were done with our meal, there was a queue out the door - that should tell ya something!",1
4,"Okay so saam bo fan (3 bbq meat combination over rice) in NYC won't cost nearly this much, but hey, it's london, and where else can you get this kind of tasty food for £7. 
Don't be silly, get the 3 meat combo (roast duck, roast pork, soy sauce chicken). Use the ginger scallion sauce... all of it - mix it in your rice!
We're going back tonight.",1
3,"Another Thursday, another Chinese in 25 minutes review.  My rice with bbq duck and roast pork was delicious with about a 5 inch strip of each pork and veggie.  It came with a larger than normal portion of gratuitous chinese cabbage (i.e. more than 1 leaf).  As others have said, the soy gravy that comes with it is quite sweet, but I like it that way.
They were nice people there, with 3 types of chillies and gave me soured plum sauce immediately when I requested it.
The bad thing was they dumped some oranges on my table before I finished the plate and then dumped the check on the table whiles I was finishing the orange.  They took the bill away the second I reached for the mint and my hand left the bill container thingy.  Although I get that it is busy, I didn't appreciate being literally swept out of the restaurant.  I must say, it was probably them more than me who kept the meal to the 25 minutes limit.
Food:  Solid 4.5 stars.  Service: (minus 1 star) = 3.5 stars.",-1
5,"Over many visits to this Chinatown staple I have sampled many of their excellent dishes and I can honestly say that I have never once been disappointed. Four Seasons is known for their barbecued meats and for good reason. Their Peking Duck is succulent and tasty. I also have their Crispy Aromatic duck which is very flavourful and crispy- the most perfect incarnation of this dish that I have ever had. In terms of other starters I have had the Peking Dumplings (strong flavour and very 'juicy') and Vegetarian Spring Rolls (Crispy with a high amount of vegetables inside). In terms of Main Course I have a group of dishes which are some of my favourites in the world. The Pork chop in honey and pepper sauce (from the Chef's Specials) is delicious, the pork chops are always flavoursome with a crispy exterior, the sauce is absolutely delicious and sweet with an almost caramel texture this combined with chopped up onions makes an absolutely stunning dish. The Black Bean dishes are also very good. The Beans themselves are as tasteful as ever and are slightly soft as (in my opinion they should be) and with a kick of chili it is very good. I would recommend the Beef in Black Bean sauce rather than the pork as the Pork is sometimes a tad too fatty for me. The Singapore Noodles are also very good with another hit of Chili to add to the flavour. As someone who is a huge fan of Mushrooms the Chicken with Chinese and Straw mushrooms is delicious and always comes with a hearty helping of various Mushrooms. The straw mushrooms are especially delicious!! 
Even though I have visited many times and have eaten many dishes there, there are still loads of dishes I want to try, the Fish dishes will be next I think. Anyway it has a great range of dishes at very competitive prices; we spent about £25 a head and had more food than we could eat. The only negative for some people may be the service. It is not always particularly efficient and/or 'chatty' but thats exactly what gives this place it's authentic charm.
Overall:
Price: Very good for the volume of food (Around £15-25 a head)
Favourite Item: Pork Chop in Honey and Pepper Sauce.
Worst Aspect: I honestly cannot name one.
Would recommend? Definitely I plan to go back as soon as possible.",1
5,"Best roast duck in the world? That's what Financial Times writer Nicholas Lander reckons and it was his write up about Four Seasons that led me there. I'm not too sure it's the best in the world but it's the best I've had in London and on par with the roast duck I had at the considerably more upscale Peninsula Hotel in Beijing.
 One piece of advice based on my experience at Four Seasons: forego the rest of the menu and just order the duck. Everything I've tried on the menu is pretty good but nowhere near as good as the duck. Besides there are plenty of other decent Chinese restaurant around Chinatown.",1
3,"This is the little sister restaurant to the famous Four Seasons in Queensway. To emphasise the point, the word 'Queensway' is actually written in brackets on the restaurant sign. 
Four Seasons is famous for its roast duck. For my quick tutorial on the different types of duck in a CHinese restaurant, please refer to my review of the original Four Seasons in Queensway. I think the duck here is good but the accompanying soya sauce is a little sweet for my taste. They also offer it on or off the bone - it costs more to have it de-boned.
I find it fascinating to stand and watch the chef using his big cleaver with the precision of a surgeon to de-bone the duck.
So why one star less than the Queensway restaurant? The service here seems to have taken on the Chinatown shouting rudeness. At Queesnway, they never shout, even when it's stupidly busy.",-1
3,"Gosh this place does some things really well but other things are just really awful. Their cantonese style bbq-ed meats are justly popular. Most people go for the roast duck but I find their soy sauce chicken is quite delicious as well. For a little bit more than a fiver, you can get a decent portion of bbq, a little bit of veg, and a pile of rice.
However I made the mistake of coming here for dinner and trying some things off their ""specials"" menu. In chinese, they all sounded very appetising and more interesting than western style chinese food. In the end however what we got did not live up to what I was expecting; certainly nowhere close to what I've had in Vancouver, Hong Kong, San Francisco, even Royal China here in London. The portion sizes were extremely small, mediocre in skill, and poor value.
I say stick to the rice plate and roast meat and you'll do fine.",-1
3,"Great food but slow service and the fact there's only one toilet to service too floors seems strange; especially when it wouldn't look out of place in a squat!
 I'd be back for the duck though!",-1

 I totally adore Four Seasons. I LOVE their roast duck and really, if you can ignore the rubbish service (it's a Chinese restaurant afterall), you'll love the place.
 Things to note about Four Seasons:
 It's a dodgy little Chinese joint, not a five star hotel.
 There's one at Queensway and one at Chinatown. You'll find me at the Chinatown branch.
 They serve half duck or whole duck
 With or without bone at the same price.
 People get take out from there all the time, sometimes to take overseas (no joke the duck is that good)
 So it's rumoured (I haven't seen this) that they have a special container to pack duck for overseas travel!
 Wow that's hardcore!
 There's always a queue at Four Seasons
 And you can totally make a booking but you still have to queue (beats me).
 They work on turning the tables over so when you receive your main, expect to also receive your oranges and bill
 But with your bill they also give you kool mints, which I love.
 Customer service? There is none, but who cares.",1
3,"Ate with some relatives here.  
Four Seasons is located in the middle of the Chinatown corridor in London.  A bit difficult to find.  
Had a very nice white fish, tofu, and vegetable soup.  The roast duck was delicious, although a bit on the sweeter side.  It was served on a bed of napa cabbage.  Also had the crispy roast pork and bbq pork which was a bit on the dry side.",-1
3,Kinda disappointed about the food and service. The interior needs a bit of a redo.,-1
4,"What can I say about this place? Every time I'm back in London, I visit here. The sweet and sour pork dish is really good and their crispy duck is pretty delicious as well. It's usually pretty crowded here and they've got about as many tables they can put in here. The service is terrible though just cause they're asian and it comes across that way. They want to give you quick service but because asian people talk in shrill voices, it sounds like they're yelling at you. Hahah. I'd say it's worth a visit though!",1
4,"Pretty good black bean chow fun. Excellent sweet and sour sauce and very good service. They need better tables, but other than that I was quite satisfied.",1
4,BEST beef black bean chow fun.  Every time I'm in London I have to eat here at least twice.  The toffee apples are also pretty delicious. It's always crowded so the seating can be uncomfortable but it's all worth it.,1
5,Venue of choice for roast duck and roast meat in Chinatown. Takeaway and enjoy a delicious meal in Central London!,1
4,"I love their barbecue meats (roast duck, bbq pork, roast pork, etc). I have gone with family and friends, and it's always been a hit. You can get a selection of three barbeue items for under a tenner, and it's a good way to try a little bit of everything. Service could be better, but the food is definitely worth coming for.",1
4,"After many years of remembering a great comfort food meal at the Bayswater restaurant, finally had a chance to return.  Very good roast meats but recalled a better roast duck than I had.  Slightly disappointed in the end to expectations but still a good quality Cantonese Chinese restaurant.  Had a perception it was better than the best equivalent in NY, but in the end, it was an equal.",1
1,"I was not impressed with
this restaurant, my boyfriend and I was awfully hungry and stumbled across this
restaurant which had a queue outside of it. Naturally we assumed this was a
good restaurant as many customers were waiting to go inside. The downstairs part was
very busy and a man came to take our names and told us it would be 15 minutes
before being seated. When it was our turn, we were told to go upstairs- as I
went up the stairs, I passed a door which looked like a staff room for the
waiters (little did I know) this is where we would be seated. A waiter opened the door
and took us to our table, the upstairs was crammed! And too close for comfort
as you could not have a conversation without everyone else hearing you!  The upstairs
was just jam packed with tables and chairs with hardly any space to move. Definitely
not a romantic place to go for dinner. The prices for the food
was double for something as simple as rice and stir fried vegetables, but that
is because it's situated in the middle of Central London. There was one thing that I
thought was highly cheeky! Was with our spring rolls they gave us a small bowl
of what looked like Soysauce- I dipped my roll into this and said to my
boyfriend This does not taste like Soysauce, it tastes like Leaperrins, Worcestershire
sauce, to which my boyfriend replied Ofcourse it is, because
they left the bottle next to the till behind you! I was shocked!- I'm not
asian but even I know that was a pure mockery especially to those who know Oriental
food very well. I would not go back there again! Unless you enjoy being crammed
into a sardine tin room!",-1
1,"Unfortunately, I can't say I had a positive experience. We ordered wonton noodle and a rice plate. The noodle was just okay, but the BBQ pork and duck on rice was terrible. The BBQ pork is supposed to have crispy skin, which was not the case. The duck was all fat. The portion was also very small. We will not come back.",-1
5,Four Seasons call themselves 'roast duck specialists' and not for nothing! This is their new branch (the one other branch is in Queensway) and is already very popular. Their dishes can be quite pricey compared to the average in China Town (around £8 each) but there are less expensive rice dishes e.g. rice + a good helping of delicious roast duck is = £4.90. So with tea and service charge you can get a very decent meal for about £6. Expect to pay more if you want to try out the more flamboyant dishes though.,1
2,"The service at Four Seasons is atrocious. There is always a long queue so waiters try their best to make diners eat up, pay up, and get out to make way for other customers.
Not too long ago, I had dinner at Four Seasons with a friend. He was not very good at using chopsticks but insisted on using them. Halfway through our meal, a waiter rudely snatched the chopsticks from his hand and gave him a fork and a spoon. 
A little later, before we could finish eating, they cleared our table without asking if we were done and served our dessert of oranges. We were too shocked to say anything. We then took our time with the oranges but were interrupted by the arrival of our bill which we had not asked for.
We ignored the bill and carried on talking as we were not ready to leave. Not long after, the waiter returned and literally asked us to leave.
I did the roast duck that everyone raves about and do not intend to. If you are vegetarian like me, you might want to think twice about going to Four Seasons. Their food tasted average to me and I am sure you can find similar food in other Chinatown establishments.",-1
5,The Roast Duck. That is all.,1
4,"Absolutely nice duck! The duck sauce is amazing, definitely worth a try. The restaurant itself is quite tiny and the waiters rude but I'm guessing thats what you get everywhere from a chinese restaurant in China Town.",1
4,"We visited Four Seasons after hearing that the roast duck was good. We got the Cantonese roast duck, another clay pot dish and some tofu. All three dishes were great. The duck was especially good. It is pricey when compared to what we are used to in NY or HK, but the food was good enough to justify the higher price.",1
1,"There are so many great places to eat in China Town, I would give this one a miss and try any of the others. I was expecting Bayswater quality food and was was let down once again. It was bland and basic nothing exciting or even that tasty. The service was probably the most appalling I have seen. After we finished our main course we were asked to leave so that they could seat other people! So not the place to catch up with friends, because you won't be sitting, drinking tea, or having a chat after dinner. I made sure there was no tip left after the service we received.",-1
4,"Great dimsum in a fun area, perfect for meals before or after a play at The Globe or the National Theatre. We had an assortment of dimsums and tea, all of which were decent. Note, this isn't an authentic dimsum place as such, but it's a neat westernised atmosphere if you're not feeling like going to Chinatown. My favourite were the chicken with cashew nuts and the hargau. 
Service was decent, though it was generally busy in the restaurant. Allow for extra time before and after if you want to make it to a show.",1
5,"I enjoyed our visit to Ping Pong and would definitely stop back for some dim sum!  I'm kind of curious why they chose the name Ping Pong, but I won't lose any sleep over it!  Just remember this:  Dim sum is not an arithmetic calculation gone wrong, its the name of steamed, bite-sized, Chinese dishes with a variety of selection to please any palate. 
The pre-selected order had a nice variety, but the server also recommended the beef and kimchi dumplings. This was by far my favorite dish of the evening!  The perfectly seared dumplings might as well have been little fireworks exploding with flavors in my mouth. There was the right amount of spice, heat, and flavor to make my tastebuds smile like the Cheshire Cat. 
I fell in love with the decor, but I'm a sucker for koi. If I lived in London I'm sure you'd find me here regularly... I can't wait to come back.",1
5,"Best dim sum I've had! We went here on my first day in London and the food and drinks were outstanding! 
We tried pork buns, veggie dumplings, prawn crunch, mushroom chicken over rice, etc. The only thing I did not like was the sticky rice.",1
2,"The dim sum here is average. I love dim sum but their dim sum only looks nice in presentation and is rather commercial. Nothing about the taste really stood out and it was quite plain. The table service here was alright. Although one guy in particular could have provided a better service, because they did a mistake with the menu which caused us paying for something that wasn't worth it. If taken the price into consideration, I'd say a definite no. 
So briefly, food average, service average, price not justified. 
It's not a horrible place, but also has nothing I can recall that would make me want to come back.",-1
2,"Ping Pong is confused. I don't think this restaurant knows what it wants to be. The servers lacked knowledge and made more than a few mistakes during our time dining with them.
We both the Ping Pong sampler dish, which got us three dishes: a rice/meat bowl, a fried component, and a steamed component.
We were told to order more because the portions were small and we wouldn't be filled. Because they said this, I ordered a fried spicy chicken addition.
It was more than enough. We were both very hungry and ended up being full and ordered too much food.
The ambience doesn't match the look of the store. The music was light house music and it felt like someone was going to ask me to try to drop acid or something.
It was odd and the worst dining experience of my London trip.",-1
3,"The dim sum was not good. Half of the items off the ""Ping Pong Selection"" tasted like plastic. The food is definitely overpriced for the quality! Maybe my standards are high because I'm chinese, but also maybe this is just extremely average food.",-1
5,The staff were very helpful and friendly. They even made sure that I got a meat free menu. I had lovely cocktails and dim sum and will definitely come back!,1
5,"Absolutely loved this place. It was super crowded but still, the service was extremely nice, polite, helpful and fast. 
The atmosphere was great, interiorly is cool, DJ was amazing, but it was definitely loud and wouldn't be a place to go for a calm, private candle dinner. Also not a place for kids (in the evening) at all. 
The food was great and there were some extraordinary pieces we loved. 
Drinks were really good. The bathrooms were clean and had nice hand cream available. 
We later had a problem with the credit card and my bf had to try and call his bank, then walk to the next station for cash and then that didn't work and then I paid with my card. The whole ordeal took probably 30 min and none of the servers got impatient or rude. 
100% recommend. You can eat late night here and then move on to the bar down the street for a fun night.",1
5,"This was my first time eating Dim Sum! It was amazing quality and great flavor. The prices also were pretty great. My best friend and I ventured into ping pong on a whim and it's safe to say we loved it. I will be bringing my sister here as well! 
Everything was so soft and tasty. The menu is a la carte and everything is definitely shareable. They also have set menus that are done per person. I'd say experiment a bit and go with the a la carte menu. The potato and edamame cakes were amazing! We also ordered chicken and prawn + spicy veggie dim sum. It was so good. 
Honestly, I can't wait to go back!!",1
2,"I love dim sum but this is mass-produced and not well done. Service was average. We had several different waiters yet it was difficult to catch anyone in particular to order more food, drinks or the bill. We ordered a second round of dim sum which became confusing on the order sheet but rather than clarify with us, the waitress just put in an order for 6 extra dim sum of which 2 items were forgotten and 2 were wrong. She put through higher priced items that we didn't order which was irritating and we received no apology or offer to re-make correctly. I hate service charge being added to the bill and in a place like this it seems to discourage any effort from the staff. The area has many better options nearby which I recommend you try instead. A very small plus - the flavoured ice-teas were good, so the 2 stars are for the tea.",-1
3,Went there after riding the London eye...mediocre food and drinks. Great environment though. But other than that everything was pretty run-of-the-mill...,-1
1,"Ping Pong is an abomination. Never have I been more outraged with an eating establishment. Here's why
1. Fake Chinese food - ingredients, seasoning and executions are poor imitation of Chinese style food
2. Dumplings are flat with small fillings
3. Tiny servings
4. Inconsistent timing. First dish served, wait. 2nd dish served, another wait. The remaining dishes served simultaneously. Either served single dish back-to-back or everything together.
5. It's winter where hot noodle soup would have been a popular order. Yet all such dishes have been struck out of the menu, why?
6. Expensive
£70 later, 2 adults + 2 kids left hungry
Dim sum is a well-regarded specialty cuisine that Ping Pong fails to deliver, don't come for the food",-1
3,"Not mentioned anywhere on the menu, but EVERYONE at the table has to order the bottomless bellinis in order to participate. Otherwise, you pay for them individually (6.95) instead of the 13.00 upgrade.",-1
2,"If you're in this area of London and you want dim sum or ANY Asian food, you should just leg it across the river to Chinatown instead. I won't say the food was terrible, because it wasn't. In fact, the soft shell crab bao dish was really nice!! The dim sum though was... not great... Granted, coming from South East Asia my standards are probably higher than most, I can still count several other places that have daily dim sum that are better. For example, har gau is meant to look like a shiny jewel that you can just about see the prawn through. The har gau here was far too thick so it felt like the insides were not enough. I mean it tasted good, but considering the portion was as small (3 pieces) and not superb, I was let down. The iced teas were really nice so there was that. 
TL;DR - You want dim sum? Go to Chinatown.",-1
3,"Very nice for a Sunday brunch with friends.
I pre-booked a table because that's how we roll. Easy peasy.
Keep in mind, they advise that they turn tables but we were not pushed out as the turnover was steady and they always seemed to have an empty table to accommodate other arriving diners.
The initial drink service was slow and mind you, 2 of us opted for the bottomless Bellini's - we did start to wonder if they were being slow because of that, hence limiting how many we would actually get. Hmm
Anyway, the food was tasty and there are more than enough options on the All You Can Eat Dim Sum (aka Lazy Sunday) to satisfy anyone.
Lovely - we'll be back!",-1
3,"I've tried the lazy sumdays menu and was quite full after. Unfortunately, the quality of some of the food was not that great. However, I'd recommend the rice bowls and thai soups though.
The xiao long bao and shu mai's weren't really that great compared to China Town.",-1
5,"Hands down this was the best dim sum I have ever eaten! We came in for an early dinner and we were promptly seated and the process was explained (to me anyway, my boyfriend is a dim sum aficionado).
I ordered the hibiscus spritz which comes in two parts, with a flower frozen in an ice cube and a tower for the drink. It was amazing, sweet and refreshing with a unique presentation. 
We sampled a variety of food and the first out was the shrimp balls. They were filling with a good mix inside, though difficult to eat since fried bits were on all ends. The dipping sauce that came with this was fantastic. Next up were my boyfriend's favourite the char sui bun, which was good. When I tasted the har gau I thought that would be my favourite of the night but the last up crab and prawn dumpling trumped it. Everything we had was delicious and we left completely stuffed. 
Our waitress was attentive, the drinks were expertly crafted and all the food we tried was phenomenal. If you are looking for a good meal in London I would definitely recommend coming here.",1
2,"I hadn't been to this branch for over a year, and I'm sad to say that it's still a pretty poor example of a Ping Pong. While the food is on point (try the new pork soup steamed dumplings - I can't spell it but you'll see it on the menu), the ambience is rather lost when you have to sit outside because they still have those awful eight people tables in the main dining area.
But at least we managed to avoid those again. Instead we ended up on a rather small two person table outside - which was made better once the nearby heat lamp was turned off as suddenly it felt like we weren't being cooked.
Food was fine but the manager who took the order slip from us didn't notice we had ordered two portions of the pork buns. So once our waiter realised it was rectified but came a while after everything else.",-1
1,"One of the worst meals ever.  Located near Royal Festival Hall, this is a very happening spot.  Dim sum and swanky modern decor, the wait was long and the food looked good.  We had high expectations and the anticipation was exciting.  Our server was not very friendly and seemed shocked we did not want anything but tap water.  The ordering process is like a sushi bar where you mark your own list of dim sum.  We picked items and tried to flag our server down.  She comes back, took our order sheet, then a while later says they are out of a ton of stuff, crossing out several of our order list and other items....okay thanks.  We decided to stick with the remaining first and ended up adding one item (shrimp toast).  
The food took forever to come out and when it did, it looked pretty good but tasted terrible.  Sometimes the temperature was off (our first dish was the honey chicken on rice and it was partially hot and partially cold).  As my mom put it, the food got worse with each dish.  The duck spring rolls were mushy and bland, the beef lettuce wraps (a special) were just boring plain shredded beef with no flavor, and it was just so disappointing.
Unfortunately, it was pricey too, and we left spending way more than we should have for a meal that was barely edible.  Don't be fooled by the crowds and go somewhere else!",-1
4,"Ping Pong has always looked so stylish from the outside so I was excited to go in and try the food.
Ordering can be a bit tricky, as you are called to fill out a form with all the items on the menu. We were four people and 3 of us went for the set menu so when the items started arriving it took a while for us to figure out which one belonged to what menu and explain to the waitress she would have to tell us what was what.
The food itself was very satisfying, I particularly enjoyed the fried selection  but the dumplings and vegetables were quite nice too. The black tea was a bit bitter but full of flavour so I enjoyed that without needing to add any sugar.
I felt quite full after that meal but the guys in the group (the other two set menus) did mention they could still eat more so you may want to keep that in mind and order a couple more dishes. I'd say ordering lots of things and sharing would be the best option.
In general it was a lovely place for a midweek lunch with my team and I hope we go back again.",1
4,"I love ping pong for mommy get togethers. There's rarely a fuss over prams or kiddos running amok which is good for me and the food is really good. Or so it tastes better because I have limited time and usually rocking a pram to sleep or running after my toddler with a delicious pork rib in hand. Either way, i'm a huge fan!
The chicken and crunchy peanut salad is really good. Avcocado, crisp lettuce, chicken, and a great peanut sauce thats still light. Well done. 
The spicy prawn bao is a build it your own asian style taco thing that was super tasty as well. I'm not keen on build it your own stuff but this wasn't messy or anything so that is a plus. 
The Mocktails were also really nice. I had the jasmine and mint, the jasmine had gone a bit bitter as it was brewed a while but i'm not sure if i'm just a tea snob or not. I take that back, i'm a total tea snob and i know what over brewed tea tastes like. That being said, it was still nice. 
The staff were really nice too. Can't help but love staff that fix all that 3 toddlers destroy. Bless them.",1
5,"One of my favourite places to eat, they really are little parcels of heaven! They have great set menus to help you choose but my personal favourite is the all you can eat sumdays (on a Sunday) all you can eat bar the specials and desserts. I have been known to graze for hours on. Lovely Sunday afternoon and the south bank branch has a little outdoor seating area which is great for people watching. Highly recommend! 
Oh and if you love it get a loyalty card, I've had many a free lunch of the lazy sumday points!",1
5,"How can I not love this place?!!!!
It's the fusion Chinese restaurant with unique style. I love the bar while you are waiting for your seat. 
The dim sum here are delicious. Worth the wait.",1
2,"Really no need. Dumplings have been made with more taste and variety in any Chinese Restaurant. This place is very Europeanized and modernized. For posh people and young couples. Good coctails but dark , noisy, expensive restaurant.",-1
4,"Quality dim sum, affordable prices, good service.
The dishes are creative and they have either set menus or a la carte.  Really nice concept for a restaurant which we'd eat at often if it were close to home.
Definitely would stop back again and again!
Delicious food and a decent atmosphere.  I'd recommend.",1
5,"Really good food and great value. Steamed pork rolls were a particular highlight!
We went on a Friday night and had to wait about 40 mins - not too bad as we were able to sit in the bar upstairs. But get there early if you don't want to wait!",1
3,"For the longest time, I was very anti-Ping Pong.  I've been here a couple of times before and never felt very keen to come back but have to say my view (or taste buds) have changed for this place.  I came here for lunch recently and ordered the Super 8 lunch special which I thought was pretty good.  For the group, we had the pork puff pastries and spare ribs.  
Everything was actually quite good and would consider coming back.  I think it's a good alternative - also they have a lot of good veggie options.  I do like the modern look and feel of the place and such a good location.",-1
5,"This is a decently trendy place, a while back at another branch a waiter told me that the owner hired the same interior designer who did mega trendy and expensive Nobu's interior  and Ping Pong's is almost copy.  However here they seem to have refreshed from then and the concept and the design has moved on since then to keep it current.
The main waiter was great, making sure we had everything we needed and really  attentive. Although the other staff were nice, they did have that disturbance of feeling a bit rushed.
The dim sum is superb, this is a chain though so the food does feel a bit like it is made to a formula, but is good.
It is starts at about £26-£30 because will need to order a lot as it is a few dim sum with each order.
A good dim sum place that will not dissapoint.",1
3,"Ah, Ping Pong. I want to love you. I really, really do. Lots of the food is yummy and while it's a bit expensive, we can still usually get out for around £30 for 2 (no alcohol). 
Unfortunately I'm not a big fan of this branch. It's big and loud and we're almost always put at a table for 8, all scrunched around with strangers and no room. I get that it's how it is there but it's not really my thing.
We went last week with another couple, and were at a nice table for 4. The service is usually quite good but on this occasion, our waiter just could not be bothered. Since we wanted separate bills, each couple did their own ticking off on separate papers. The waiter insisted that he had to combine them and that he couldn't bring us each our own bill. After much arguing, he eventually relented but it set a sour tone for the evening, and our service was pretty awful all night. Luckily we had decent food in good company and it didn't ruin our night!
(On a side note, the other couple's bill was over twice what ours was - it would have been quite a pain to try to figure it out on our own, especially after a few drinks!)",-1
5,"My favorite dim sum in town! They have great deals and set menus :) the drinks are awesome and really refreshing, the ginger and lime tea is delicious! 
the place is also nice and after you fill yourself with food theres nothing better than go for a little walk around the river and appreciate the view while you digest all that amazing food !",1
2,"Went for dinner with friends.
Likes: 
1. Interior very nice
2. Servers very polite 
3. Ordered the lychee and ginger iced tea was very nice
4. The duck spring rolls were nice
Dislikes: 
1. Waited a long time for our food 
2. Food came at different times 
3. Found the food very expensive for the portion of food
4. Music was so loud we couldn't even hear each other speak
We were waiting for so long we ended up leaving after a trying a few dishes and had a burrito at wahacca's kitchen food van.  
Overall I don't think I'll be going back for dinner at ping pong, however if I do go back I'll probably order a set menu instead or just go for lunch.",-1
2,"I always say...when going to an asian resturant..look around you and see if its either full of asians or non-asians as it is a good indication of how authentic it is... 
me and my friend were the only 2 asians there lol.
Honestly the food was not that great...it wasnt bad though~~ but I love my dimsum and was expecting to eat turnip paste cakes (aka carrot cake) which was not on the menu. Its definately a westernized concept. Which is fine for those looking for that. 
The duck spring rolls were nice, the beef & spinach dumplings too, but disappointed in the pork bun... disappointed in the fried asparagus little dinky dried up strings came out. Disappointed in the bak choy (the cut off the leafy portion for presentation im assuming? Didnt appreciate just the white part of the vegetable... 
The cocktails looked amazing though~~ didnt have one but presentation was nice~ sat by the bar~ 
What I liked: 
1. Staff was really friendly 
2. Ambiance was great, nice place, lots of people
3. Good location right next to waterloo station by the weekend market stalls",-1
4,"One day as I got back from visiting my family in France, I realized right off the Eurostar that I had no food at home and had forgotten to place a tesco delivery. I was starving and decided I wanted dumplings and nothing else so I embarked on a Yelp journey to find good dumplings in my neighborhood. Alex's review of Ping Pong was a good enough insurance for me so I ordered various dumplings from Ping Pong on Deliveroo. Literally just dumplings. 
The delivery came fast and the dumplings were really good. I had a nice assortment of which i can't remember the composition exactly (that review has been waiting for me for a long time now oops). The dumplings came with nice sauces to accompany it. 
I'm sorry I can't write more as I didn't get the full restaurant experience, but I'd definitely try one oof their restaurant if I get the chance.",1
2,"Want Chinese food that's half the quality and twice the price? Well look no further because this is your joint. As an added bonus, the waitstaff will stay as far away from you as possible to ensure your privacy is maintained throughout the meal. Who wants people bothering them with food orders or cluttering your table with food and drinks? 
Seriously, if you're jonesing for Chinese food and your in Southbank then I suppose this place will do. It's good for groups because it's huge and they serve something that resembles Chinese food. But you can really do a lot better in the area.",-1
3,"We had such a mixed experience here that I wish I could rate food and service separately.
Food: 4 stars. The dim sum came out as it was ready, and it was nearly as good as the dim sum we had in Chinatown in Seattle. The Char Siu buns in particular are not to be missed. It was all hot, tasty, and in good sized portions. 
Service: 1 star. Absolutely appalling. We were ignored for about 15 minutes, then caught the attention of the very friendly waiter for the table next to us. We asked him about how ordering works, and as he was getting ready to take our order, the grumpiest man alive came over and brusquely asked what we wanted. It was clear that he was meant to be our waiter but had been nowhere to be seen for 20 minutes. He took our order and stomped off. 
Things did not improve. Dishes came out in a timely manner, but it took us flagging down the friendly waiter to order a second round. Hot water for my tea arrived 10 minutes after my dry flowering tea ball. We ordered steamed buns that have broth in them (and are served with a spoon to catch the broth), but no spoons were brought over. We had to use our soy sauce dishes instead (serendipitously, our soy sauce was empty so we hadn't used the dishes yet). 15 minutes after we asked for our cheque, I again had to flag someone down (a host) and ask for it again. It came, and I spent 10 minutes waiting for the grumpy waiter to look at us so I could get him to bring the card reader.
All in all, we spent most of our visit being totally ignored by our waiter, who was incredibly unfriendly. We were pretty frustrated with the automatic 12.5% tip, as well, as he definitely didn't earn a penny of it. 
We enjoyed the food, but because the overall experience was so poor, we won't be returning.",-1
4,"I know some people are ehh about chains, but i really really like Ping Pong. I miss good dim sum, and honestly this is a good place to take a bunch of people with a decent atmosphere with good food.  Its not super greasy like the hole in the wall places in San Francisco but not as pricey as the fancy ones I have been to in SF either.  
For three of us with plenty of dim sum, wine and tea, it came out to £55 in total, which I actualy think is great.  I am going to come back for sure and especially this one because its in the southbank area (one of the best areas in London in my opinion).",1
3,"The selection of restaurants on the Southbank isn't plentiful - especially when you don't count the markets. Ping Pong is one of the few that I've come to quite a few times because of its relatively speedy service and relatively tasty dim sum. Not the best by far, and definitely not the cheapest. But if you by from the set menu, then you get a decent amount of food for a decent price. Cocktails are sweet, service is friendly. I'll probably end up here again, but I don't purposely seek it out. A solid 3 stars from me.",-1
4,"Great atmosphere, decor offset the tasty, but quite small dim sum.
This was my first time at Ping Pong. I planned to have a quick lunch armed with my newly registered Ping Pong Loyalty Card, Email for a free cocktail and booking for the Super 8 Menu. The Super 8 menu consisting of a chicken rice pot, tea of your choice, won-ton soup with dumplings, and 5 pre-selected dim sum pieces.
I opted to sit outside as it was a nice day. It was a little breezy, but every table has a heating element above it, meaning you're not left shivering in late September. I would imagine these would be ineffective when the weather drops below 15 degrees.
The staff were pleasant, but there seemed to be a lot of confusion around my cocktail voucher, and to be honest the waiter was clearly new and picking things up. First to arrive was my cocktail. This was a ginger passionfruit crushed ice cocktail. It wasn't very good. Next my complimentary prawn crackers with assortment of dips. Note: you'll need a ping pong loyalty card to get this, but it's free! These were okay. 
The dim sum arrived shortly after, and I was left slightly puzzled. Normally when I dine chinese, I expect the soup to come first, followed by rice then everything else. I didn't know whether to pick at my tiny dim sum pieces or wait for the soup and rice pot to arrive...after 5 minutes I decide to tuck in. The dim sum was obviously made in house. Both the taste and shapes made it obvious. These weren't your run of the mill production line dim sum. But also left room for skimping on the size. The only one adequate size was the chicken/prawn one. The rest were far too small. If I was paying around £3-4 for 3 pieces I would most definitely be disappointed. However in the context of the deal and extras, it was more than filling. 
As I polished off 2 of the 5 pieces, the Lychee Red Black scented tea arrived. The aroma was dazzling, and the taste wonderful. Full of flavour and silky smooth without any bitterness. Beautiful. Then finally the rice pot and won-ton soup came. The soup was strange. Tasted nothing like the wonton soup I'm used to and was surprisingly sour. The wonton dumplings were great. Quite large and tasty. The rice pot was the highlight of the meal. The oyster based sauce full of flavour, and plenty of chicken and lots of chinese black mushroom (a delicacy). One of the best rice pots I've ever had. The dipping sauces included chilli oil (all oil, no actual flakes :/), and chilli. The special sauces as a loyalty card holder included chilli black bean sauce (delish), sweet and sour and sesame hoi sin sauce. They were pleasant, but really only the chilli based ones worked with dim sum.
So in all, the decor of the place really impressed. Somebody really though about the experience visually. Unfortunately the food (in respect to the dim sum) is below average and the order dishes arrive is a little random. Two things that wouldn't take a lot of effort to improve. Otherwise it has all the small touches I appreciate. Unprotected wifi, loyalty card scheme, lovely interior, unique tea blends. Lets see the major food points fixed, and this place would be an easy 5 stars.",1
4,"This is my second visit to a Ping Pong and I'm glad to say that the food was as good as I remember.
The dim sum, while not matching up to what I had in Shanghai, is reliable and the restaurant itself seemed easy enough to just rock up and get a table.
In the evenings the staff seem pretty rushed off their feet so you really have to be patient when vying for their attention!",1
1,"I have been on a Ping Pong hiatus for about two years, but was recently in need of a quick bite before a show at the Southbank in December 2014 and decided to revisit. I was craving steamed buns, so we were determined to get in despite the queue that was trailing outside of the restaurant. We barely managed to get food, however, and our experience was utterly tainted by overburdened staff and misinformation- I can confidently say we will continue to avoid Ping Pong for future as a potential dining venue.
In particular, we were told that the waiting time for a two person table would be 20 minutes, but it was at least a 40 minute wait before anyone made any effort to seat us. Only after we complained were we directed to a communal table, so we put our foot down and demanded a two person arrangement as we had originally requested. To our astonishment, we were then swiftly seated. 
We nearly had to physically grab a server because we were having difficulties getting anyone's attention and were forced to order all of our food in a frenzy while stressing that we only had 20 minutes to dine. The server attempted to be congenial and arrange for our bill to be presented immediately to help speed things up, but was still very slow in manifesting this and to take payment. We had no sauces on our table and asked another passing server for these, but they never arrived and we ended up sharing with our neighbours. Our table was literally so close to both adjacent tables that we were pinned to the wall as well- it was the most stressful and uncomfortable meal I have experienced in recent memory.
It must be acknowledged that they did honour an NUS discount and that I have previously eaten at other, smaller and speedier branches of Ping Pong in the past, but the Southbank branch is best avoided if you wish to enjoy a relaxing meal. I can barely recall the quality of the food because we were so dissatisfied with the visit and were forced to voraciously stuff everything in our faces, but I recall that the steamed buns that I did order would have otherwise proved satisfactory as they are a specialty of the chain.",-1
5,Yummy Yummy Yummy I am totally in love with this restaurant. I've never tried out any dim sum restaurants before and I was completely shocked to find that this place actually had good tasting food. From the ambience to the cocktails that were decently priced I totally recommend this place You will not be disappointed. Service was fast and my waitress was attentive and very helpful when it came down to explaining their menu. Overall I had a wonderful experience,1
3,"The Ping Pong menu is a stylised and sterilised form of a dimsum portfolio. So much so that it loses the dimsum edge. Dimsum is a Chinatown thing and should just stay that way. 
The Southbank Ping Pong is definitely one of the better ones, not just because it looks and feels like cool dining, but also because of the efficient and friendly service level. There's a chance you order might be delayed on busy occasions, but overall, I've never had a bad experience here.",-1
4,"Nice environment quirky way of been served you tick the items off the menu & they serve as as soon as its ready things come in cool banquets and you give order 3-4 plates each a share the food which is cool, we were seated on a table with a group of people we didn't know this was nice as you got to interact & chat to people you wouldn't normally. Food was really tasty & dessert was lovley would recommend",1
5,"I love their all you can eat offer on their Dim Sum Sundays. It's bottomless dishes (selected ones only) with a complimentary cocktail if you arrive for 12pm. It's perfect for a big party get-to-gether...no faffing with the bills and you can also order whatever you like, however much you want. We also were left alone to enjoy our menu without the pressure of feeling like you are being watched or needed to give your table up for someone else. It's one of my favourite places to go and chill out with my mates whilst enjoying some decent dumplings.",1
2,"After this last visit I think I've now given up on Ping Pong, it's overpriced, the service is rubbish and the food is mediocre.
Came here as I had an offer and even then I get I paid too much, the portions were small and the server pretty much ignored us. We didn't get any free refills on our tea and trying to pay the bill was a challenge. The only good thing is the food was tasty, just wish there had been more of it.",-1
5,"Just before hitting an event at the Hide&Seek Party event at the Old Vic Tunnels... thought it was a good idea to get some food in my belly as I didn't want a repeat of  my over imbibing session a few days earlier so food was a must!
I like the modern look of the place. It's not traditional dim sum or atmosphere, still a nice venue and menu. 
So we stuffed our faces till our bellies were full. Job well done.",1
3,Good dumplings but way too expensive for what you get.  Everything comes in portions of 3 which is daft if there's 2 of you on a date...who gets the 3rd one....urggghgh...!!,-1
1,"They made us wait 20 minutes and said the food is no longer available. So we changed our order and after 20 minutes they came back saying sorry your food is not available and served us the bill. 
Really really unacceptable and rude service",-1
4,"Great selections, lovely space, good service. I would go back again on a day when I had time to wander along Southbank,",1
1,"Bad service and food! If you want real dim sum, just go into Chinatown instead.
We went for a friend's birthday on a Saturday afternoon. The manager was really rude to our party and did not seem to want to help.
The food is presented nicely but is nothing special.
Very unlikely to ever go again.",-1
1,"Food was delicious. Service was the worst I have experienced in years. After ordering a drink, we had to remind wait staff twice of the order. It took 45mins for the drink to arrive. Comically unbelievable. Do not go here. Visit another restaurant in the area (I recommend arch duke), or a better ping pong in the city. The wait staff here need to be fired and replaced to save this restaurant.
If you do visit, do not sit outside. The wait staff seemed especially incompetent here as the manager could not see these tables. If you are being served by the bald man, leave immediately as your experience will be worse than terrible",-1
3,"A run of the mill 3* from me for Ping Pong Southbank. Last night was my second visit to this particular dim sum establishment. We had to wait 30 minutes but we cracked open a bottle of wine upstairs in the cocktail bar so that was fine. 
Our waiter was really lovely and friendly, but a bit useless (ie lots of running around and flapping but not much actual doing). That said, I don't really mind crap service when someone is as nice a fella as this dude was, he made us laugh a few times and that's worth its weight in gold (we're cold as ice Kent girls). 
The food was good, no complaints, nothing super special I'll warrant though. They forgot a few dishes which we had to nudge them about.  
I know it's a really lame thing to say but I'm not really into the sharing tables The tables and benches are rounded, and ideal for a group of 8 or so. But for the 3 musketeers alone, nay so good.  With 3 or 4 groups ordering food and wine, there was no space for anything. The chairs don't have backs, which means if you chilling out for the long haul (we were there like 3 hours gossiping away) you're potentially going to be doing a lot of hunching over your table and my back was creaking by the end (I need posture lessons, must Yelp that next).
In short, I would go back if someone else really wanted to go. Else, I probably wouldn't.",-1
4,"The dim sum is good and the service is usually fine. Lazy Sumdays (all you cut eat) is great, although I very rarely actually meet the charge (they charge you separately if so).",1
2,"Good food, terrible service. Our waitress was nowhere to be found, so I had to take my drinks to the bar to get my own refill. I had to walk up to the manager to ask for my bill after waiting for 20 minutes for the waitress. The manager did not care.  Worst part is they put a 12% tip on my bill.",-1
2,"Ping Pong's dim sum just isn't very good quality or tasty. It's also too expensive. However, it's a nice looking restaurant in a convenient location on the South Bank so you're probably going to end up in here eventually. There's not much more to say really. If you want dim sum in Central London, I'd suggest New World in Chinatown.",-1
3,"I went with one of my friends when visiting the South Bank Christmas market and was pleasantly surprised by Ping Pong. This is certainly a chain that I'd visit again - the food is fine and I especially love that you can mix and match - and share - different dishes. 
We went for steamed buns with vegetables, dumplings with shrimps and chive, dumplings with shrimps and coriander, dumplings with vegetables, spring rolls with vegetables, sticky rice with vegetables, and shrimp crackers.
The concept is that you fill out on the order card with all your favourites, hand it to the waiter so he can pass your order to the kitchen. Then the waiter returns with your order form, and as the food is prepared and arrives steaming hot to your table, he crosses the dishes out one by one from the list. 
It's a great flexible system that can accommodate both snacky and havn't-eaten-in-days customers with the same ease as you basically tailormake your own menu. I love it so of course I'll come back!",-1
4,"Pingpong is a personal favourite and All you can eat Sumday is a treat! You really have to eat a lot to make it worth while financially, but that is just the kind of justification that let's you say ""we'll take one of everything!"". Great location for exploring Southbank",1
3,"Now I was EXCITED for this, more than normal when going to try a restaurant! Why, I hear you exclaim? Well I'll tell oh reader (channeling Miranda a little bit there). My FAVOURITE kind of food ever is Dim Sum. Little parcels of heaven, often washed down with a fragrant smelling tea. I and do LOVE tea.
So Ping Pong, known in my circle of friends as the upmarket chain dim sum restaurant of choice in London (we are working on a catchier title trust me!). This one is in prime location, South Bank. Also nice decoration and always busy, even upstairs at the bar. That tells me that Ping Pong is doing something right. So I went in with high expectations. A fragrant cocktail at a very reasonable price (hibiscus mojito, why yes I'll have more please) started the evening well. Then we attempted the dim sum. Drum roll please. Well, in my head anyway. 
The Dim Sum was nice, good selection and tasty indeed. I felt slightly overpriced for what you were getting, especially considering Chinatown isn't a million miles away and hidden in there are some SUPERB cheaper places (if you know where to look). Don't get me wrong, a wonderful evening - don't go for a cheap meal (don't get dim sum if you want a cheap meal to be honest) but I would go again. Mainly for the cocktails, but considering this is my favourite kind of cuisine EVER I was satisfied. Yes readers, that is Daniel P and his high standards... ;)",-1
4,"I had dinner at Ping Pong with some friends while visiting from America. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was friendly. The food was delicious - I chose from the preset menu, and everything on it was great. I didn't like that we couldn't make a reservation unless there was at least 6 of us, and they didn't bring us the checklists back, so we were unsure as to who ordered what some of the time. Overall, a great experience, and I would return when I'm back in the UK!",1
5,"Second time at ping pong, first time in the one in the southbank centre... second time is a charm because I have just found out they do a all you can eat dim sum sunday menu for around £20!!
 the first time I didnt like it because I spent to much money and left hungry, but now im in love with this place and their extensive menu! cant wait for next sunday! loved the drinks... I had some non alcoholic drinks ie.. the Lemon and Lychee, and iced teas such as the lemongrass and passion fruit and lime... I loved them all. The lemongrass was amazing because it wasn't overly sweet and quenched my thirst and felt less sugar infused. All the dim sums where amazing im getting hungry just writing this.",1
3,"This is the kind of place where I believe timing is essential to your experience. To me, it was busy and loud in all the wrong ways. Coming in on a Thursday night at 7:30PM, I immediately thought to myself that the noise level was way out of hand. Even though we were just three people at the start of the evening, I could not make out what the other two were talking about, even though they were sitting next to me. 
My grumpy mood might have been affected by my hunger, because it was soon forgotten as  the food and drinks finally arrived. In short, the dim sum was all in all pretty good. Not mind-blowingly good, but for the price I was more than satisfied. The dim sums are a bit ""fusion"" - far from any classic dim sum restaurant in Chinatown, but they cater well to a Western palate with safe choices like honey glazed ribs and the like. No boiled hen feet on this menu ...
Although you can't go wrong with the beers they serve, we definitely went wrong with the drinks. The mojito they serve, of which two of us ordered, was the worst I have had. 90% ice, very bitter, and not a hint of any booze in there at all. We ended up returning ours. We had a couple of others that seemed alright, among those a  passion fruit drink. All in all I just think drinks are not their forte.",-1
4,"In a word: YUM!!!
I came here last week with some friends and we loved this place! The overall vibe is trendy, modern, and just generally cool. We arrived at around 8:15pm on a Tuesday night and the place was packed! With the promise of being seated in 15 minutes, we put our names on the list, took a buzzer, and decided to get a drink in the lounge upstairs.
The lounge is outfitted with plush seating and sleek wooden tables. While the space looks pretty, it's a bit impractical. The seats are quite low and packed closely together, which is inconvenient for my fellow members of Team Long Legs. Also, the lounge features table service, but there was no clear host/hostess on the night that I visited. I think my friends and I caused a bit of a kerfuffle amongst the staff when we 1) seated ourselves and 2) ordered drinks from someone who wasn't assigned to our table. Welp I don't feel bad because better service procedures would have avoided the confusion.
When our buzzer finally rang 30 minutes later (!!), we returned downstairs to one of the circular family-style tables. Our waitress recommended that each person order five dishes. I'm not entirely sure how ravenous one would have to be to order that much food, but I was very hungry and very satisfied with two dim sum dishes, one rice pot, and a lite bite. All my items were delicious, filling, and well worth the money!
The one other issue that I had with Ping Pong was our waitress. Le sigh, here comes the classic ""bad British service"" complaint. But seriously, our waitress rolled her eyes at my friend when she asked for a different liquor in her cocktail, which the lounge hostess upstairs specifically told us was an acceptable request. Then when we asked to split the bill, our waitress handed us a pencil and told us to split it ourselves. I personally didn't have a problem with that because I assumed that doing the math ourselves ensured that everyone paid for their own items. After our waitress took the divided dim sum sheet from us, she returned with receipts that did not match the sums that we calculated for her. On top of that, she added 12.5% gratuity. I did not recall seeing a note about automatic gratuity on the menu. I would certainly expect that for a party of 6+, but not for 3 people! And certainly not for such mediocre service. We all paid it anyways because we didn't want to cause a scene. 
I think I'd return to Ping Pong for the food and the atmosphere, but I'd just avoid that particularly rubbish waitress.",1
5,Yum! If you like dim sum then you'll love ping pong. Such a yummy dining experience. Ok so it's a chain. But the foods good the cocktails are great. Price is reasonable and it's great to share dishes with friends or have to yourself. Give it a go. Oh and they do all you can eat on a Sunday such a good deal.,1
4,"This is a good option for groups consisting of people with different dietery needs. Dishes are marked gf and vegetarian, and upon request they will bring you a list of what's currently vegan. The location is nice too, and I can it's imagine gorgeous in the summer to sit outside!",1
4,"First of all, if you want a true dim sum experience, there are better places in Chinatown.  And that says a lot.  You lose that authentic ambiance without the rolling carts bustling about.  Not to mention that the selection is missing a lot of the more ""ethnic"" gems.  I suppose much of this is to be expected given the clientele of the establishment.  *cough*cough* NOT ASIAN *cough*cough*  Ping Pong is more of a white-washed, fusion restaurant catering mostly to bland taste buds.
With that being said, if you look hard enough, you will be able to find some tasty options on the Dim Sum menu that take a few steps away from standard Chinese dishes.  Be prepared to use a lot of sauce to capture the flavor though.
   ~ Five stars:  The Crispy Prawn Balls.  Superb, and unique.  A flaky and crispy shell with a thick, paste of a filling.  Pretty heavy.  These were the favorite of the night.
   ~ Five stars: Hoi Sin Vegetable Puff.  Also a favorite, crunchy and light.  I could have eaten five more of these.
   ~ Five stars: The Honey Glazed Spare Ribs.  So popular that night, that they ended up running out.  I was pleasantly surprised and would have ordered more if they didn't run out.
   ~ Four stars: Steamed Sichuan Rabbit Dumpling.  Mmmm, rabbit.  This is a seasonal special.  The leanness of the rabbit paired well with the hearty steamed bun shell and syrupy sauce.
   ~ Three stars: The Crispy Duck Spring Rolls.  It's actually an egg roll.  Still, I pretty much love anything with duck, so long as it's prepared right.  The Hoi Sin Sauce is obviously what made this dish delicious, but I also found the duck to be tender and flavorful.  
Note that each selection comes in a set of three.  So if you're with a party of four, order doubles of each dish?  
Total came to around £11 per person for a group of three.  We ordered no drinks, except hot tea.  There is a ""Set Menu for 1"" deal priced at £9.95 per person that includes a single serving portion from 10 different dishes, but the selection isn't that fantastic.
I'm used to putting up with bland food while I'm staying in London.  The taste buds here are atrocious.  And honestly, though most of the food selections were underwhelming, I was still pleasantly surprised with many of our selections.  Not to mention that Ping Pong is a frequented establishment for many of my friends.  
While I'm sure that at any other time, I would have awarded Ping Pong with just three stars, I found the complimentary hot tea a nice gesture, the overall price affordable and decent, the atmosphere cool and chic, the service fast, the bathrooms clean, and the location convenient.",1
3,"My boyfriend and I have never had Dim Sum before and many of my friends were ranting and raving about how incredible Ping Pong was ! Being we were near Southbank last night, we figured we would give it a try. The food was absolutely delicious, but the service was a bit poor. There had to be over 5 waiters waiting on our table. We ordered from the set menu for 2 and the food did not come in order. It was crowded and a Saturday night so of course it is going to be busy. At one point we thought they forgot about us. We got complementary tea and coffee from them for being so patient. 
I would definitely go back but I would like to try Ping Pong in a different location to see if I have a different experience !",-1
2,"Good service. All the waiters and waitresses are nice. However as a Chinese from Canton I have to say, the dim sum here is not good. There are a lot of English-Chinese dim sum. We ordered some classic dishes like Ha Gau and it is not salty enough. It's not expensive but I won't go again.",-1
1,"Awful! Dined here twice (second time unavoidable as bday party) and just terrible. The food is second rate P F Chang quality at best, and Panda Express at worst. Not what I was expecting considering its trendy rep and classy ambiance. Very expensive and while the host was charming both times the waiting staff acted like they couldn't care less.",-1
4,"Really love this restaurant. Like a wagamama you sit at tables with other people and get to enjoy the bustling atmosphere as it is always busy.
 Amazing dim sum with dumplings that look like clouds and taste even better.
 You do need to be a non-fussy eater and possibly lover of fish, as the menu is quite fish heavy as well as being dumpling heavy.
 Fresh lemonade with your choice of syrup/fruity flavour is excellent and the flowering teas are amazing!
 Really great place to meet friends for lunch or dinner. Even better if there is a bigger group of you!",1
3,Not as good as the original. Food was fine but much more touristy. Probably partly due to the area it is in. Spend the time to search out the original or one of their other venues.,-1
4,"My first time at a Ping Pong. We had to wait a bit to get a seat so we sat at the bar and waited for a long while to get served- you may need to accost a waiter to get a drink, they seem a little ""toff"" biased.
However, we chose 3 dishes between the two of us, from a VEGAN menu- yes folks, I was really impressed that they had a seperate menu, awesome huh? That's pretty much why I rated high, because I found the food to be really tasty, especially the vegetable-y rice packaged in leaves, and the mushroom parcels. Although, the 3 dishes between us and 3 drinks came to nearly £30, I went home and devoured a sandwich. For a solo meal, perhaps 2 dishes would be ideal as you get 3 bits of each so you can share.
Anyway, great food, slightly squished seating, the toilets were clean and smelled LOVELY (a bit like bubblegum), and the service was fairly slow getting the order and paying but not sniffy, just busy although the food arrived nice and quickly!
The flower teas are beautiful, and if you live in East london near Shoreditch, They even deliver- lucky!",1
3,"I'm a fan of Ping Pong but this is not my favourite branch of the chain particularly due to its location which goes for and against it. 
The food and drinks are delicious, like in all branches of Ping Pong, and we went recently for the Sunday buffet for £18.99 which was fantastic value if like my friend and I, you believe you can eat your own bodyweight in dim sum and still walk out as if you've eaten a light salad! I've never known defeat like it. 
What lets this branch down, though obviously too is a plus, is its location on the busy  chain & tourist fest that is the Southbank. You cannot book, so on one busy Sunday we were turned away, and they are always busy so you have no other choice than to savour one of their delicious cocktails; juices; wines in the bar while you wait. You also need to be prepared to be seated with others while you dine. Sometimes this doesn't bother me but when you are trying to eat your own bodyweight in dim sum and you and your friends want an adult conversation, you'd rather it not be listened in on by tourist's and their young son! 
The staff were friendly and the service was good / quick considering how busy it was but I would rather not return to this branch.",-1
4,"Loved Ping Pong and plan to return on our next trip to London. I will admit I come from Southern California and we don't have awesome dim sum, so my comparison might be poor, but I thought this dim sum was great, on par with what I can get in the Bay Area, maybe better. We waited about 20 minutes which wasn't bad at all. Price seemed very reasonable. Service was pleasant, our server made some suggestions when asked for that were all happily accepted and enjoyed when served.  And we didn't feel rushed which on a Saturday night is very appreciated. I hate it when servers try and rush you out so they can get their next table, if I'm still drinking they will still get money. I was very happy overall.",1
3,"I'll keep this one brief:
- Good selection of dim sum, but expensive.
- Great cocktails.
- Fast-paced, busy atmosphere.
On Sunday they do a £20 all-you-can-eat deal.",-1
5,"Delicious Dim Sum. Would heartily recommend the set menus, as they do provide enough food for oen hungry person. But if you're really hungry, add a few items from the main menu. The Honey Chicken rice pot (can't remember the precise name) is absolutely delicious!
Oh, and if you're thirsty, consider ordering a tea. They are served in lovely insulated glasses, and you can get one of the blossoming one, making for a beautiful slow motion show while you eat.",1
4,"I am torn.
My Chinese half says: ""WAY OVER PRICED!"" Literally double the price of eating at some places in Chinatown London. And more like 2.5X the price of dim sum in LA/Boston/San Francisco/NYC. This same half of me, usually hates nice, pricey Asian places on principal and prefers hole in the wall cheap stuff with good food over good/cool/any discernible attempts at atmosphere. 
My white side says: ""But, but... its pretty! And there are no chicken feet or weird innards to order around!"" Plus, my non-ethnic eating/vegetarian friends might actually try this. Did I mention that this side of me is also a HUGE sucker for anything chic Asian fusion-y? Plus they DO have some interesting, non-traditional dumplings to try... Ok?
Apparently my less practical side wins on this one. FINE. I'll pay double for your cool atmosphere, Ping Pong. But I won't like it!",1
1,"Having lived in Shanghai and visited many Chinatowns in cities around the world...Dumplings here were average at best.  They lacked the differentiating flavor one expects when you take your first bite.  Bland fillings wrapped in a dumpling.  It took 25+ minutes for 3 of 4 of the items I order to arrive at my table.  Worse, they brought me a check before the fourth item I ordered arrived.  Good concept, but poorly executed.  Dumplings were temperature hot.",-1
2,"Its a shame to give Ping Pong only 2 stars but its not for the dim sum, its for this branch. There are not enough staff, and the staff that eventually do server you are incompetent. The service is really slow and they never have anything left to serve you from the menu. There are better branches around london to experience the tastiness of Ping Pong's dim sum. I would recommend the branch at St. Katherine's Dock - It is quieter and overlooks the dock at Tower Bridge - Romantic!
Dishes to try, are everything! Ha ha! To be honest, you are really spoilt for choice, however, I would recommend:
Har Gau
Fish Dumpling 
Spicy Braised Beef Coconut Rice Clay Pot
Crispy Hoi Sin duck roll
Spicy Seaweed Prawn Crackers
Vegetable Won ton soup...
... and NOT forgetting Hot Sake.
Don't let the crappy service and experience at this branch put you off of going back to Ping Pong in the future. As a general improvement, I would like to see more staff and better opening hours for all Ping Pong branches as the opening hours vary due to the location.",-1
5,"There are not many places in town where you can write directly on the tabletops of a restaurant.  Ping Pong does not make exception to this rule.  It does, however, defy another semi-truism about London:  It is not always easy to find a delicious meal in a good restaurant for reasonable price.  
My family and I ate lunch here.  We were sat at a tale with some other guests - a move I always find cozy and quite conducive to friendly feeling meal.  (Conducive that is unless you are sat next to the Adams Family or Stalin.)  The decor was a zen sand garden, rocks of tables place gracefully among carefully raked sand.  
My family and I ordered a variety of dishes as one often does in dim sum.  Some steamed dumplings with prawn, some veggies with spice wrapped in something quite nice made of rice), soup, steamed rice, and more.  All items (soup excluded) came in sets of three like the Triplets of Belleville.  We were more content than a hoard of otters playing in the water.  Everything made our stomachs cry out with joyous choruses of ""hallelujah!"".  
Our soprano, mezzo soprano, alto and baritone converged into a chorus golden as Orpheus strumming his lyre.  The bill came to about 7 or 8 per person.  We didn't eat heavy, but we ate enough, and walked out light on our feet.  
The only deceiving aspect was that no paddles and ping pong balls were provided as a diversion.  Guess I'll have to bring my own next time.  Think they'll mind if I run around the restaurant smacking a small white off the wall?",1
4,"I love the style of ping pong restaurants. They are really nice to look at and well staffed. It is expensive for what you get, but can be convenient for a light dinner. Dim Sum is well made and tastes good. I would prefer more choice. Offers loyalty cards which gets you some free nibbles. This place charges 12.5% service",1
2,"Never in the history of Dim Sum have such small parcels of food been so expensive to eat for so many.
I made the mistake of going here with the family on a Friday evening with no reservation.
They found us a table quickly to their credit as the place was rammed. The service, despite the pace of the place was commendable. Fast, friendly with no fuss. 
My biggest complaint was the food: way too expensive for what it was. 
As a steamed dumpling fiend, the chicken Shu Mai hit the stomach in the right place and in truth, there's something here for all tastes. Thing is, though there's lot of different things to eat, there isn't a lot to eat.
Call me old school but i like to have a lot of Dim Sum on a few plates, rather than half a dozen platters holding three so-so parcels each. You'll eat but you won't be getting satisfied any time this side of the Rapture. 
Ping Pong's all a bit too sanitised and lacks surprise. As for the drinks make sure you actually receive liquid rather than a tumbler full of ice.
 
Considering that there was no alcohol involved, the best part of one hundred pounds for a meal, after which i felt hungry again wasn't a good advert for the popular chain.
The saving grace i guess was the location, on London's perennially busy South Bank but you can't eat a view can you?",-1
2,"I hate Ping Pong. I hate its greasy little fancy 'round' prawn toasts (which just means bread got thrown away, which is a shameful waste). I hate its stupidly expensive menu. I hate that its pork buns aren't as good as any in Chinatown. I hate waiting ages for a table with rubbish bar service in the meantime. I hate the haughty waiting staff. I hate that it seems to have invaded London. I hate that it is so easy to go here, the bill always shocks me, and I feel dirty handing over my money. 
I really like their bubble tea-style champagne cocktail. 
I am weak.",-1
3,"ended up in this restaurant on a hot, sunny and busy saturday afternoon during the summer when there was a culture festival going on on the south bank. 
it wasn't our first choice at all but it was super busy everywhere else. 
the place was nice inside, really trendy will cool round tables which i like so you can see everyone. the menu is interesting will the tick boxes and the little pencils so you circle what you want, it's fun but it's kind of gratuitous - like being cool and being simple, though actually it's kind of annoying in a big group because no one could decide what was going on! maybe a smaller group would have been easier. 
then the reason why this is only 3 stars is because even though yes the food was alright it was very expensive and tiny portions. not cool with me! but hey! That's london!",-1
3,"If I were to rate Ping Pong on their interior design I'd be giving them a 5 but I'm sorry to say their food is overpriced for what it is. 
This restaurant is beautiful and the drinks are fantastic which brought my rating from a 2 to a 3 star. 
The service I received at the restaurant was ok, and the food was adequate.  In the past year they have changed their menu, and to be honest their old menu was better.  
Our food arrived quickly and it all tasted good, their dessert menu isn't fantastic, so you might have to follow on somewhere else afterwards :) 
It is quite expensive considering you may not leave full. 
In my opinion there are much better Dim Sum places in China town.",-1
4,"It's taken me years to finally make it to Ping Pong. Don't ask me why -- I've seen it around town and always meant to go, but for some reason I was never able to get around to it until yesterday. I'll set the scene. Its a frightfully Grey and painfully cold Monday. My Monday morning blues are immense and the vibe at my office is bleak, so my colleague and I decide to head out for some comfort food on our lunch hour. We headed for Southbank and the genius revelation to make this the day that I visit Ping Pong for the first time came about. Upon entering we were greeted by a lovely hostess who took us to our table and informed us of their lunch offer. £8 for an 8-item set meal plus a signature tea drink. Amazing and yes please! We placed our orders and I could feel the Monday blues leaving my system immediately. 10 minutes later we were surrounded by a plethora of food. For a mere £8 we each got.....4 steaming hot sticky chicken and prawn dim sum balls, sauteed mushrooms, steamed broccoli, hot and spicy chicken won ton soup, a steaming bowl of honeyed chicken breast and rice and a bottomless flowering green tea. By the end I literally felt like a Dim Sum. I was stuffed to the brim, happy as a clam and....ready for a nap. Sadly, we had to head back to the office, but my £8 delight definitely kept the spirits up all day. 
Our waiter was so lovely as well. He was extremely helpful and attentive and made our meal that much more enjoyable. 
Thanks Ping Pong! I'll most certainly be back...but I may have to skip breakfast next time around!",1
3,"Hmmm. Good idea, and nice and buzzy. Reasonable menu, with a few unusual dim sum, although portions are smaller, and prices higher, than Soho. But it's still good value  our lunch for two was £32 with flower tea, four dim sum and pud. Forget the tea with a flower  looks ok but not as nice as proper Chinese tea. I have enjoyed two meals here, but won't be deserting my Soho favourite  Joy King Lau.",-1
4,"Best dim sum I've ever had? No, probably not. Fun and enjoyable afternoon with good company and tasty food? Yes, definitely!
On arrival at Ping Pong, I was nervous that the table that I'd booked for 10 people late last night online via the Ping Pong web site would not be available since I didn't receive an email confirmation. But I need not have worried since as soon as I arrived and asked about ""my reservation for 10 people"", we were whisked upstairs to the lounge/bar/dining area. I have been to this branch of Ping Pong once before, but hadn't realised that there was an upstairs area. However, I was very pleased by this as a) there was only one other group upstairs besides us; b) it was much quieter which allowed us to chat to our hearts' content; and c) the sofas were much more comfortable than the benches downstairs albeit slightly lower. At this point, a big tick for Ping Pong's technological advances and wise decision about seating allocations. 
We ordered our drinks (all choosing fancy teas of varying fanciness - my favourite of the ones I tried was the lychee and ginger iced tea cooler, which was very refreshing) and settled in to analyse the menu. Another tick for Ping Pong on a special occasion for the wide range of teas that we don't normally have when we go for a traditional dim sum meal.
The girls chose a selection of dim sum for the group, which the boys promptly tripled... The food arrived quickly and was served hot and fresh. The flavour complemented each other well - I love Ping Pong for the variety of unusual combinations (like black prawn dumplings). My only criticism is that the steamed dim sum were a bit too sticky, which meant the skins broke and the contents spilled out. We were also slightly disappointed that they did not have cheung fun on the menu. But decent quality food all in all. 
We also had desserts - the Ping Pong sampler, which I won't describe in detail as it would spoil the surprise - but each mouthful was was delicious and only made you want more. I'm glad I managed to squeeze in dessert!
Overall, we had a great afternoon - great company and lots of food. However, I think it is over priced (in my opinion, you can get much better traditional dim sum at a very reasonable price), but you do get the more unusual/fusion combinations (like scallop and shitake dumplings, duck spring rolls or seafood pastries). That said, we got what we paid for - a slightly different, very relaxed lunchtime gathering of friends.",1
5,"Ping Pong opened the last year I was with my old company, and we had our departmental Christmas dinner at the original branch opposite the London Palladium. It was packed solid, and I remember it was difficult to get a booking. I had the day off due to moving into my new home that day and met my shortly to be ex-colleagues for what was a very fun evening, with delicious, madly affordable food served in a gorgeous setting. My boss managed to give me no sign I was to be fired right after Christmas.
 My fondness for Ping Pong survived this incident and I went back with my now ex-colleagues (minus the boss) for a catch-up about 6 months later, after the legal wrangling was completed. Again, it was fun.
 And I've been back subsequently with very different crowds  once with my houseguests in the summer, after a performance of The Sound of Music at the Palladium, and last week with my brother and the niece and nephew after our Royal Society lecture.
 Both visits were great. I think my older guests enjoyed themselves  the Jasmine tea is always a show-stopper  and they are the type of older visitors who appreciate an experience of 'trendy' London. The dim sum were duly demolished while friendly banter was exchanged with a couple down from the North at our communal table.
 Some critics have sniffily compared Ping Pong to Hakkasan and Yauatcha. I think the Ping Pong dim sum stand up very well, considering Ping Pong is aiming at a completely different market: mostly the post work crowd; with the dim sum hoovering up alcohol consumption.
 The trip to the new branch at the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank was a wonderful half-term family treat. We arrived just after 8pm, me thinking innocently that there would be a lull as punters left for performances at the Hall. Ha ha ha. The place was hopping, with a queue snaking out the door. We were told we had a half-hour wait but would shortly be moved into a bar area. I asked if the kids could have a snack while they waited, and my brother started complaining we couldn't wait 30 minutes with the children 'at this hour'. I mentioned there was an EAT around the corner  but my nephew bridled at this (EAT is clearly their default pit stop in Cambridge). Also, he had spotted the Chinese script on the ceiling and wanted more.
 We were asked to hang on for 5 minutes and a table was magicked up for us. I was really impressed they even bothered, considering they had flocks of people to spare. Service was brilliant and slick, and the dim sum arrived smartly. Stand-outs were the Har Gau and the squid in satay sauce. The Jasmine tea blew the children away  my little nephew thought it was an alien pod hatching.
 The dim sum are keenly priced for such a glam atmosphere  the most expensive item is £3.99: each menu item comes with 3 portions, allowing easy sharing. My nephew had a series of lemonades with fruit 'shooters'  these were as phenomenally beautiful as the jasmine tea. My brother and I stuck to G&Ts  quite fabulously delicious. These were Tanqueray but on a completely different plane to others I have had recently. 3 G&Ts = half the bill for 4 (12 courses) : £67 including service.",1
3,"Went to Ping Pong last night with a couple of friends. I'm quite a fan but they've certainly gone down hill recently.
Now we hadn't booked a table and I do have to commend them on getting us seated pretty quickly on a busy night. However, we were told to go upstairs to the bar where we then had to queue for a table. Being in a queue because we're already in another queue really isn't great.
We were called pretty quickly but were unfortunately sat outside on one of the coldest nights of the summer so far. They wouldn't switch the outdoor heaters on so we spent a good part of the evening shivering.
The food we chose wasn't bad at all but nowhere near as good as what I'd had before. The pork buns were a delight as usual but the rest wasn't much to write home (or a review) about. Much of it was fairly tasteless and much of it all tasted the same. Was it chicken, prawn or something entirely different? It leaves you wondering whether they've labelled the boxes not because people don't know what each piece should look like but because people need help identifying it when they've got it in their mouth.
Due to the cold we all drank tea to try and warm ourselves up and I had to admit that the lychee tea is rather lovely. The cocktails did look lovely and most are priced around the £6 mark so definitely worth a shot if you're sat out not in sub-arctic conditions.
The bill came to £45 between three of us which wasn't too awful although I did have to buy a bag of crisps on my way home to keep my stomach quiet.",-1
4,"I had no idea that this was a chain (you'll see my other experiences with London chains soon - ugh) when my Aussie pal brought me here fo cocktails and endless rounds of dim sum. Being from Vancouver, where Chinese food is practically the local cuisine, I have high standards for my dim sum, and I (mostly) wasn't disappointed!
The decor and menu were interesting, and we ordered round after round of the yummy dim sum - 10 orders and prawn chips between 3 of us. 
Favourites included the crispy prawn balls (we ordered a second round of these) and the shu mai. The crab spring roll, shrimp har gow and prawn and shitake dumplings were also delicious. 
For me, the only miss was the veggie steambuns- wayyyy too sweet for my taste.
The cocktail list was fresh and inventive - I tried a fennel and apple martini, a basil, lemon and black pepper martini and a vanilla vodka lemonade that tasted like Lucky Charms. Yum! Just one question - when we order mixed fancy fruity cocktails here in Vancouver, they are generally made with 2 ounces of liquor, but I am sure that these were just made with one. I noticed this a few other places in London - is this standard?
The service really petered off by the end of the night - in order to make this a five star experience the wait staff really needs to keep the standards high thoughout the whole night. 
On the whole, give it a try!",1
4,"Besides the weird anomaly of having a great Mojito in a Chinese restaurant, there is nothing out of place at Ping Pong. Its stylishly designed over too floors, and upstairs is a cocktail lounge bar where you can meet friends before your meal. 
The service is very fast, and the dim sum is deliscious. This is a great place to meet a large group of friends - the circular tables allow you to see everyone at the same time. And you can share a large variety of food, and get pleasingly sloshed on the excellent cocktails before taking a short walk along the river to watch a movie. Low lighting and candles make it a good romantic spot in the evening too.",1
3,"Smack on again Yelp, this place is !-OK. And that's it.  
The prices are on par for what you get, it's not expensive per se (we paid 25 pounds each for 2 beers per person and dinner), but that was made  Our German server was hot and cold -- he made some decent suggestions for our meal, but for some reason was unable to pull off little things like bringing water and utensils and had to be asked no less that three times for each of those.  It was slightly upsetting when the bill had a customary 12.5% service charge and we felt that the service had been lacking, but as this was a first meeting for the lot of us no one felt they should complain about it. 
Next time my friend, next time.  
Nah, who am I kidding?  With all there is for me to hit in London, why have a next time at a 3/5 restaurant :)",-1
4,Great Place! Very nice people/waiters. Food and Cocktails are great! :D I keep going back for more,1
3,"Ehhhh.....
This is my first time getting Dim Sum anywhere. I live near Boston and Chinatown has its fair share of dim sum but i've never been brave enough to order. Colleagues highly recommended Ping Pong (which I kept calling Polka dot all day.. but that's neither here nor there). I went here with high expectations and left somewhat disappointed.. and 50.00 poorer.. and kind of hungry still. 
Hubby and I shared 8 plates and each got soup. My soup was the best part of the meal. I got the hot & Sour soup- flavorful and spicy and very good. For food we got the mushroom oyster (not great), the spicy pork dumplings (decent but really mushy), black bean pastry things (awful, tasted like burnt pie crust), black seafood dumplings (extremely good, but small- order a few!), prawns wrapped in shrimp (ok, but  lacking much flavor), sticky rice wrapped in some kind of tough leaves (not very good), Crunchy spring rolls (good, but standard fried food) and squid cakes (just ok, nothing to write home about). 
Each plate was somewhere between 3-4GBP. altogether we spent almost 50.00 and i left still pretty hungry but not wanting to spend anymore money on food there!
Atmosphere was nice. Probably wouldn't go back though.",-1
1,"Ping Pong South Bank, I have fallen out of love with you.
 I used to really love this place. The food, the drinks, the decor and ambience. All top-notch.
 I went here on Saturday night - I've been there when it's been busy before, and it was fine, but this time around we should have seen the warning signs when we were handed one of those stupid pager things that Student Unions hand out if you're waiting for a burger and chips. After waiting for a table in the bar, we then had to literally wave at the waiters to get somebody to take our drinks order.
 When we eventually got a table to eat at, we discovered that a lot of food on the menu was 'not available' - much to our disappointment. The food, when it arrived, was delicious as ever, but then when the mains were finished, a bill was whacked down on our table, without even asking if we wanted dessert or tea, seemingly in an attempt to turn the table around quicker. We were given a dessert menu after a request... but then had a bizarrely epic wait to get the bill at the end.
 What used to be a great restaurant is now swamped and understaffed on busy nights - leaving yourself up against a bizarre conflict of staff who one minute seem desparate to get you out of the table, and the next are impossibly hard to get ahold of in order to take orders / provide service. Dining is supposed to be relaxing, not leaving you stressed at constant efforts to get the attention of staff, as you squeeze around a communal table that is simply not big enough for the food of all of the dining groups.
 At £75 for 2 including service, it ends up leaving me with a horribly nasty taste in the mouth. The food was great, but did I have a pleasurable dining experience? Not in the slightest. The staff tried their best, but there just wasn't enough of them.
 I would not go to the South Bank Ping Pong again, at least not on the weekend. I think I'll be returning to a quieter branch in future...",-1
2,"Ping Pong puts the dim in dim sum.
While I wish I could credit this, um, lil' 12 location establishment with a winning game of tasty morsels of steamed delicious, it was more like a continual back and forth match of disappointment. Nothing was absolutely terrible, but first there was something off with drinks, then service, then texture, then service, then salt, then service, then, then, then... and so went the head shaking evening. The meal was just uncomfortable, even with fantastic company. 
I take it back, there was point of absolute terribleness: the toilets were disgraceful. It's the first time here in London that I've felt the word ""toilet"" aptly described a bathroom.  
Shame too, because I was the female Ping Pong champ throughout school. I have a deep love for the game.  Guess you just didn't come to play.",-1
2,"Expensive, swankified dim sum is nearly always a disappointment. Ping Pong is no exception.
Imagine a huge restaurant filled with bustling carts piled high with steamers chock full of plump dumplings, plates of just sauteed vegetables, dishes teeming with crispy fried squid, pushed by no-nonsense ladies who don't speak English and cut your taro root with scissors in front of you at your crowded, noisy table of 8 people about to burst with tiny dishes. Makes me hungry just thinking about it. 
Pong pong is nothing like that. Portions are small, the decor is trying hard for a lounge feel, and they serve pricey martinis. But even if you really want a chichi martini with your pork dumplings, at least those pork dumplings and those martinis should be good. And you should get more than 3 in an order for a dish costing over £3.
I realize I have high expectations for Chinese food, particularly dim sum. But this place is a perfect example of promoting atmosphere over taste and charging way too much for something that is designed to be cheap and delicious. If you're not going for the food, maybe you'll love it!",-1
2,"I was in London town recently and concluding a lovely early evening stroll along the Thames we decided to try out Ping pong. 
I desperately wanted this to be good, with a quirky name and an inviting seating area outside, we decided to give it a go. The result was a very uncomfortable hour after which we were left with nothing but a bill, regret and a stomach asking why oh why did you put me through that. 
The food simply wasn't up to it. It lacked taste. The steamed rice might as well have been from Tesco's or Asda. I was left not just disappointed but slightly angry at the cheek of serving such mediocre food.  Luckily London saves the day. The day was so enjoyable this mishap didn't make too much of a dint on the old mood.",-1
2,"I went to Ping Pong last Sunday with an open mind and bear in mind I've had Dim Sum only once in Chinatown as a reference.
 Ping Pong from the outside looks nice and impressive. Equally the décor seemed okay inside.
 Being two of us they did ask if we wanted to sit immediately if we didn't mind being in the sun. It was absolutely fine I add.
 We considered the Unlimited menu but wondered whether we'd really eat that much bearing in mind the price of £18.79(?) does not cover drinks and some items of the menu.
 Ping Pong do Dim Sum and they do it well. The two most memorable ones were the Black Prawn steamed dumplings and the one with Turmeric. I notice they sell them as three's so one each and then you have to split the third?
 It's not all perfect: I found a piece of clear plastic in my mouthful from one of the Claypot selections.
I knew I had to highlight this and the waitress quickly said she would get the Manager who apologised and offered us a couple of glasses of wine on the house.
 Prior to this episode, the first steamed Broccoli that was delivered to the table was like mush and was sent back. The second one that came was exactly the same. More about this later.
 We hadn't had breakfast and ate quite a lot, more than we needed to. If we had gone for the Unlimited, we'd have made a small saving each - say the equivalent of one dish so be certain you are going to eat a lot.
 I thought the set menus looked good and took a lot of hassle out of what to order. Any feedback from others on their value?
 Back to Broccoli: When it came to paying I pointed out to the Waitress that the Broccoli had been mush. She just said sorry.
Then whilst waiting for the other half near the exit the Manager came over to say goodbye and we had a little cordial chat. He asked me if everything else was okay and I asked how the broccoli should have been served. Apparently crispy (with a bite).
I told him about mine and in reply he told me how hard it was to monitor so much being steamed especially on a Sunday.
 Is that a reasonable excuse? I don't think so. I rarely have fault to complain so never too sure what to expect when I do - not that I was on the Broccoli - I was giving feedback though I should have mentioned that £3.79 for a tiny portion of steamed Broccoli is a rip-off.
 Will I go again? I think I'll give it a miss and find that place in Chinatown.",-1
2,"Ooooooh dear. This really didn't tick the ""tasty dim sum"" box this evening.
The main problem here was service. It was *appallingly* slow and inattentive; I literally had to thrust my order into one of the waitstaff's hands in order for them to actually notice we were ready to order and take it. Not good at all. While the food came reasonably quickly afterwards, there was complete failure to clear empty dishes, and we eventually had to ask (twice!) for the bill.
The food was merely okay... yes, it was dim sum, but not exactly good dim sum. Their interpretation of bao was undercooked, their jiaozi were quite good but also slightly undercooked, the prawn toasts reasonably good, the wonton broth rather gritty and tasteless (although the wontons themselves were fair)... you get the picture.
Fortunately, the company I was with saved the evening from being a total disaster -- along with the actually quite acceptably tasting (but VERY weak!) cocktails. It's not worth the premium they charge though, I'm afraid. Overpriced, ineffective dim sum -- there are better places to go in London!",-1
5,"There is no better place to go for a quality Chinese food. I am quite the regular visitor there (maybe once or twice a week) and they know me. Although I am treated very well, there is no difference with the attitude against the other customers. That's why I can honestly say that the service is the best. The food is also amazing and always hot and spicy.",1
4,"Food was good, service was fast. Not traditional dim sum, but still very good",1
3,"i've been here twice now and really enjoyed it both times. the most recent was for a night out with my colleagues from work. we ordered the seafood and vegetable set menu for £14.95 per head and thought it was really good. dim sum can get pretty pricey (in here anyway!) if you are ordering off the menu, so this seems like good enough value. i would like it if the waiting staff would explain what each thing is when they bring it to the table, because once you order, your menus are taken away from you, and my memory is not that good! none of us knew what we were eating...and i would like to know!
the cocktails are delicious, although i'm not sure how strong they are. they are around the £7.50 mark, and being that they are in tall tumblers, i guess it is okay. i had the hong kong colada which was delicious.i really love coconut, but not creamy drinks so this was perfect for me! i ordered a second cocktail, i think it was a raspberry and limoncello caiprinha - it was tasty, but mainly ice, BOO! 
the wait staff are pretty good here - efficient and professional, but no real warmth or connection. the atmosphere is busy, loud, close together. this place is good for things like work nights out, but i don't think i would choose to come here for a meal with friends, or my boyfriend.",-1
4,"Food fab. Relaxed atmosphere. It has always been very busy whenever I have been and we can wait a while for a table. The tables are some what squashed in but in this atmosphere i didn't really mind. The toilets are clean and was fascinated to be able to see the men washing thier hands at the sinks!
Value for money.
Very yummy and will return time and time again.",1
4,"I've only been here for the Sumday Special where you can eat all you want for 18 quid. Not a bad deal. The selection of dim sum is quite extensive and I loved everything we ordered. I ate way too much of course, but it's too good of a deal not to. The sharing tables can be a bit awkward if you shared it with a family with young kids like we did and you're drinking bottles of wine. But it would be a good place for dinner before a big night out or for a party. I can't wait to go back and get my steamed pork bun on!!",1
2,"My boyfriend and I had a pretty rubbish experience at this branch of Ping Pong. I'd eaten at another one of the chain's restaurants and had a really nice meal (although expensive for what it is).
 On this occasion we arrived around 5pm for an early dinner and everything seemed to go wrong, from terrible service, wrong drinks orders, waiting 20 minutes for the bill and having to endure staff arguing very loudly for all to hear. I took the feedback card home only to discover you have to hand it to your waiter... disappointed.
 Won't be going back to this particular restaurant although I am a Dim Sum fan. Food is lovely but just that bit too expensive to make it a favourite. Hopefully others haven't had the same problem with service that I had.",-1
3,"I enjoyed eating at PingPong, I like the range of drinks and trying the out and find that the dim sum is very tasty. I took my friend for the first time and he was impressed by the food especially the mango dessert.
 Whilst the food is quite nice, the service is what lets it down as it is slow and somewhat cumbersome. You tend to see people waiting around without anyone attending to them, orders for drinks coming back after the meal is finished.
 If you are just out for a spot of lunch then I would recommend this place as the lunch time service is much better and less busy",-1
1,"beyond terrible. I would give it 0 starts if I could. The service is unbelievable, well...there isn't any. They sit you at a table then disappear until you physically have to get up and hunt one down. Everything we ordered on the menu was out of stock, the restaurant was full and people all around us were being told they didn't have this item or that item, even the tea, I was told they'd run out of jasmine tea. Took an hour for the food to arrive and it was insipid and cold and tiny portions. The bill was incredibly bad value for the food and service we recieved, in fact we and many others around us refusedd to pay the full amount. They even had the cheek to add a 10% service charge which amounted to £5.50, for service which we never recieved! avoid at all costs.",-1
3,Very good dim sum. Very extensive menu with ok prices for the area. Drinks are a bit watered down and expensive. Service could be improved as well.,-1
2,"the atmosphere's beautiful and it's really romantic here, but the server we had was a bit rude and kept looking at us funny, like we were going to bounce without asking for the bill or something. i've had better dim sum easily, albeit in the united states, but if you're on holiday in london and you want good chinese food, this isn't the place to go. we ordered maybe five plates, and only the spicy squid was any good. the bao was dry and flavorless, and all of the spring rolls we tried were underwhelming.
indeed, that's the word for ping pong: underwhelming.",-1
5,"Great atmosphere  interesting set up inside  if you're in a small group don't be surprised if you are sat on a bigger table with strangers. There was 4 of us, sat on a table with 2 ladies and a couple. The tables are so big though that you don't feel like you're imposing on anyone or vice versa.
The food is great  a good range, soups, noddles, dim sum and very helpful staff to explain the process of ordering etc.
Each dim sum dish is usually a portion of 3 dumplings. There are set menus for those who are new to the idea of dim sum and have no clue what to order. The set menu for one comes in at just under £10 and you have a good variety of dumplings and tasty morsels provided within that!
I have been twice to this particular Ping Pong, I haven't tried any others in the chain. I am very impressed and it is great if you are on a budget as all items are priced fairly cheaply.",1
2,"Ping Pong is a themed chain of restaurants that sell modern Asian food, in particular dim-sum. They are usually well decorated and usually quite busy.
 At the Waterloo branch you sit as in most of the locations around small tables, asian style. Let me start in a rather petty way by saying they're uncomfortable little things and don't lend themselves to long stay. Staying at a place for a reasonable length of time is something that high prices should allow but in the case of Ping-Pong it's not always the case.
 Foodwise, they have a great little menu that's got a lot of lovely items on. There's seafood dim-sum, which appears to be a speciality as well as the usual assorted steamed and fried dishes. Since it's somewhat Western in influence these aren't as authentic as a Chinatown place, but it's a good start.
 The dishes though are expensive, as another reviewer pointed out this is quite shocking considered the very small portions. In addition when I visited it was very easy for the server to seem to get confused and bring us the dishes for the other tables.
As an example of the price comparison, the 'special' flower tea they sell can be found for 1/10th the price in supermarkets There's a lot of mark-up on the 'exotic' nature of the products they are selling, so you need to be aware of this.
 So, overall on the food It's good, tasty and varied, but oh-so-small portions and so expensive. Very much a 3 star if you're with a group, or on a business lunch. However I actually only rate it a 2 once you factor in that you can't really justify the prices if it's only two of you dining.",-1
3,"The staff at this place were very friendly and, as you can't book a table unless there are more than 8 in your party, quite adept at telling people that they might have to wait a bit. Handily, there is a bar upstairs where you can wait (and buy expensive cocktails, obviously) and a fair ticketing system so there's little chance that you'll have enough material to write a half hour sitcom here.
 In the end we only had to wait about 15 minutes as we didn't mind sharing a table with other people. The seating in the restaurant was nice to look at but, because you're sharing a semicircular bench with someone else you do have to co-ordinate yourselves to get it in the right position. The table we sat at was for 8 and it would have been great if we'd all been together but with all that dim sum on the table it felt a little cramped trying to keep our stuff on our little quarter.
 It's a great idea to have dim sum as the entire menu as in a proper Chinese restaurant you can only get it at a certain time of day. In comparison to dim sum I've had before the menu is quite small and eclectic. But the food that we ordered was good. They asked us if we had ever been to a Harvester, I mean Ping Pong, before we ordered so it's clearly aimed at people who have never savoured the delights of dim sum before and my friend (who never has) loved it. Because the portions are smaller you feel that you can be a bit more adventurous with the menu. The waitress advised us to get 5 dishes each!! but I assured my friend that 3 each should be enough and it was.
 It was great fun in here - less brash than dim sum at a Chinese restaurant but less speedy and less menu but fun all the same. If you want authentic dim sum, though, I would recommend any Chinese restaurant instead.",-1
5,"Ding Dong, it's time for Ping Pong.
 Being a very simple lad i've always tended to end up in some greasy curry house whenever anyone has suggested Dim Sum to me before. But hey i was on the south bank and thought lets be cultural
 Really enjoyed it, it was stupidly busy but a bit of chat with the waitress and we managed to get sat in the upstairs bit almost straight away, i think it is better up there if you get the choice as it's a bit more private and you feel like you are somewhere slightly more exclusive (you aren't, you're on the Thames in a chain Dim Sum)
 Food was delicious, the cocktails looked great and the service was with a smile, in fact I seemed to be being served by about 20 different people, all with a smile.
 Ding Dong",1
3,"Very efficient on arrival, they seat you almost immediately in the bar upstairs and give you a numbered tag. This way you can relax in the bar for as long aas it takes to get a table, which can be a while in the evening as it gets very very busy.
 Once seated the novelty of ticking boxes to order different dim sum is fun although try not to get too carried away as it just seems to keep on coming and is more filling than you realise.
 Perhaps a victim of its own success it struggles to keep up with demand once you are seated. Dishes arrive sporadically at your table, we were given one of our dishes twice plus something we didn't order and then had to argue over what we had and hadn't received as we were still waiting for one of our dishes long after everything else was finished.
 If they can work on the service element it would be a lot better but the food is fun and the location is convenient. If I was craving dim sum I would travel to somewhere more authentic but this place is great for a drop in dinner if you are on the Southbank.",-1
3,"Reasonably priced dim sum. Good selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic cocktails. My favorite dishes were wasabi peanuts, spare ribs and squid.",-1
2,"I had a horrible experience at Ping Pong. I thought the food was pretty good, the spicy pork dumplings were tasty and so was the house red wine but the SERVICE was truly disgraceful.
 We were seated outside and ignored for about 15 minutes before getting a menu or any service. It was getting cold and we wanted to move inside which they said shouldn't be a problem, only a few minutes. If they couldn't move us, just tell us exactly that but they didn't and came back 20 minutes later saying it should only be a few more minutes. After getting half way through our meal, we were moved inside.
 I think it was just one person in particular that was the culprit but that put a bad taste in my mouth about the place.
 Anyways, I'll give another location a try because the food was pretty good and I had a nice rest of the evening after everything was sorted.",-1
4,"This place is fun...............Clean bright, modern and the staff are very efficient.
 There is a list of various dishes - fried, steamed, rice etc. All you have to do is tick the box beside your choice and before you know it you are set upon by various staff piling your table with lots of amazing plates of food, dipping sauces, pancakes, wine, water........... and as quickly as it came the empties are cleared away to make room for the next surge of food.
 In the main area of the restaurant there are big round turning tables, ideal for a larger group of friends who wish to share dishes.
 I came away feeling very full and the meal was really quite inexpensive. £50 for two of us which included wine and water.",1
3,"A beautiful looking restaurant with a chic and bubbly vibe. The food did not live up to the ambience though. I was excited looking at the menu but when it came the dim sum was quite pasty and stodgy and not at all light like it is in China. The portion vs cost does not balance as each dish averages at £4 and consists of 3 small peices of dim sum.
 The staff spoke poor english and I had to translate what they were saying to my dinner companion. Their good nature did make up for the lack of linguistic skills though!
 The food took a long time and so did the drinks but it was ram jam packed out.
 For 2 people with one alcoholic drink it came to £45. All that said, I would go there again.",-1
4,"I've been here a couple of times and the long queues are testament to how good it is. So busy that you have to even queue to get into the bar whilst you wait for your table but it is worth the wait if you really like your dim sum.
 If you're not sure what to have then go with friends, order random dishes and try a bit of everything, there will be something on the menu you'll like. And the cocktails are pretty good too, especially the long ones.",1
5,"Absolutely wonderful food, good prices, warm & friendly staff! Highly recommended!",1
4,"This is a great little place, part of the ever-expanding Ping Pong dim-sum chain. The food is divine, and it's a handy place to grab something whilst soaking in some culture around the South Bank. Service can vary wildly, however, they are usually quick but it can be a bit impersonal. It's always REALLY busy too so be prepared to wait.
 Overall a top tip to grab some food before a concert or gallery.",1
1,"We went to a few Ping Pong, non of them have good service. this place is disgrace. why do we want to pay to get such awful service when the food is not that particular good??!!! the host of this place should be fired, or maybe the manager, if they don't understand the value of customer, or if they don't want to serve, why are they there? I know some restaurants just happen to have big investment behind, so they afford to have best locations, no matter what they serve, or how bad is the service, people just flood in.. unless you have no place to eat, otherwise, don't bother. go to Ping Pong, just waste your money! go to china town, you can get better dimsum and better service!",-1
4,"You always have to wait to get a seat here because it gets very crowded- you can only book seats if you are in a group of 8 or more. The dim sum is great and it is rare to find a place where this type of food is emphasised. They say that you should order 5 dishes per person, but I would say that three is more than enough, But it is nice that you can almost pic and mix and have a nice range of fillings. Or you can go all out and share with friends- the round table s assist this. I am a fan of the seafood dim sum, this seems to be the special one. The bar and cocktails are equally pleasing, but do come here for the food. Prices are pricey, so keep ping pong for special occaisions!",1
5,"The ultimate dimsum restaurant, this funky, cool and popular restaurant sits proudly on the southbank down from the BFI and National Theatre. It literally does one thing, and does it well - offers dim sum. And lots of it. You are presented with menus and a piece of paper reminiscent of a cluedo sheet, which you mark according to what you want to eat, not with what implement you think Colonel Mustard used in the Ballroom. They then take the sheet and return with plates and plates of delicious goodies. I particularly recommend the duck spring rolls and the crispy prawn balls, but the har gau dumplings are amazing and you must eat some of the sticky rice which comes wrapped in a leaf. Oh, and you can't leave without trying the kumquat mojito. Summink Else!",1
3,"Been a couple of times to Ping Pong, Southbank, as it has been convenient and not too expensive. Set menues is a good choice. Saves you the hassle of choosing and you get to try more stuff. The food is average - you definitely get better dim sum in Soho. One of my friends mentioned it all tasted more or less the same the last time - think he was right on that occasion. Service has been good.",-1
4,"Great little restaurant/bar in the newly done up Southbank area. 
Round tables downstairs for social dining whilst upstairs is a cosy bar with low lighting and sofas - you can eat in the bar bit too.
 Yummy dim sum to please all at a bargain £3 a dish, plus great cocktails (i recommend the Mango & Gin one). Also a big fan of the Jasmine tea which comes in tall glasses and when hot water is added the little jasmine flower opens up - so pretty!
 Gets quite busy so recommend booking in the eve!",1
5,"Great place to go for lunch with a girlfriend. Delicious dim sum - little Chinese parcels of yummyness which come with a selection of dips. Good quality but reasonably priced. Our bill was 15 pounds each with drinks included. The interior is modern and stylish, the service brisk and efficient. Do try the sweetcorn and coriander parcels, they are truly delicious. Oh and the lemon vanilla vodka cocktails helped wash it all down very nicely. Highly recommended.",1
4,"I went with a lovely group of people to Ping Pong for a Saturday lunch. They were busy, but they have a nice lounge upstairs which worked out perfect for our medium sized group. The food was delicious, the service may have been a little slow but being an American in London, I didn't notice. Great food, awesome company made my time at Ping Pong to be superb. The food was also very affordable, plus they had the funky credit card machine they bring in to the table (the UK way of swiping it :-P) I'll definitely come back to Ping Pong for the variety of delicious offerings.",1
4,"First time I've been here, there were 10 of us, which was frankly too many for the circular tables. Best to go with two or three people. Unused to picking the food as well, which basically involves ticking a paper list after studying the menu, and then handing your choices to the waiter, who was very attentive, constantly filling our glasses with water. I had the duck spring rolls, which were delicious, the pork bun, likewise delicious, and a hot and sour soup, which was a tiny portion that quite disappointed me. 23, 26 and 138. The toilets here are very strange and deserve a mention. Basically you wash your hands by putting them underneath a counter, at which point you may encounter female hands, as teh water is shared with the girls toilets. This is just odd, as naughty pervert girls can look straight at the urinals. Splitting the bill caused a few problems as we had all decided to split evenly before the meal, then some people only wanted to pay for two courses, but it was still good value, I ended up paying £11.20 for three servings which would have cost me about £9.60 had I been on my own, which is a pretty good ratio when I remember some of the shared bills I experienced at places such as Pizza Express, where the wine drinkers and bread eaters benefited tremendously.",1
5,"I had my eye on this restaurant for months! And when I booked my table I hoped and prayed to be seated in the middle of all the floral glory, with the warm lighting reflected on the mirrors surrounding the room. 
To my pleasant surprise, I managed to be seated with my partner, on my birthday in this beautiful room I had imagine for so long. 
It is the most beautiful restaurant I have been to till date, without a doubt. However, I do feel that with all the reviews and pictures I had previously seen, I was not taken aback by the fact that I was in the room...
... quite simply, the excitement of the restaurant is so highly televised that I was not taken with surprise the way I had imagined. 
Yes I was in this beautifully decorated romantic restaurant
Yes, it was in my birthday
Yes, with my partner 
And yet I expected more. 
The restaurant itself is very small and you feel very intimate not only with your partner but with everyone else in the room. The mirrors make it appear deceptively bigger than it is. 
One thing I cannot fault, is the service. Neither my partner or myself are the most flamboyant or immaculately dressed, however, we received a very warm service. 
If you are not used to fine dining, you may occasionally within this small boogie setting, feel out of place. However, if you're like me you know you came with enough ££ to cover your meal... simply eat and enjoy.",1
5,"I'd like to give this restaurant 4.5 stars but that's not possible. First of all, I'm not sure why this is the most romantic restaurant in the world, it isn't. The service was good, but not compared to the US. The decor is very masculine. If you're really big on service then you may get slightly annoyed. They did some odd things. For example, if we were finished with a dish, one person would move it to the edge of the table instead of taking it.... our salad came after we had already been eating our entree... I don't mean to be knit picky but when you expect fine dining, you should expect fine service, and I was disappointed. 
We were given some butter with sea salt and small pot of biscuits, in addition to the bread service. We bought a bottle of the Foxglove Zinfandel and started with the Marcellin's Heritage Shoulder of Loire Valley Rabbit. To be honest, I thought it was just very slightly over cooked. About half of my portion was dry, but for the rest, I felt all the elements were really deliciously and elegantly put together. 
For our entree we both had the Oven Roasted Welsh Rack of Lamb and Chargrilled Belly. They first brought out the lamb to show us before it was plated. I found this step to be very Interesting and it allowed us to really smell the lamb and prepare our taste buds for the dish. This was absolutely delicious! And the best lamb I've ever had. I highly recommend this! It didn't have a strong lamb flavor so if you generally don't like super gamey meats, this is still really tasty! For dessert we had the whites chocolate mousse and fresh gariguette 'volupté' we almost licked the plate clean. We were given a complimentary plate of small bite desserts as well. 
I will definitely be coming back for the food.",1
4,"Try to reserve a seat in the room under the flowers.  Beautiful sky light. You'll feel like a scene from a fairy tale.  
Tastes classical French.  We had the prix-fixe menu.  The roasted chicken I had a good texture. Moist and fragrant.  I still think I would be happier with fried chicken.  Thrice cooked fries is pure, mild fragrance. Exquisite crisp outer texture and soft fluffy inside. But you might be bored if you want a stronger flavor or impactful sauce.  
Basically, food is standard French. Atmosphere is magical.",1
5,"The absolute best restaurant we've been to so far in London. It has the perfect romantic atmosphere that won't soon be forgotten by your significant other. Everything was perfect, from the drinks and  starters, to the main course, and dessert. The service was outstanding. I would say, easily the best restaurant I've had a chance to experience. You've got to try it when in London.",1
5,"Clos Maggiore is a romantic oasis in the heart of Covent Garden. Their warm and intimate influence comes from the country inns of Provence and Tuscany. Clos Maggiore is ranked one of the worlds most romantic restaurants. It feels magical even on the outside of the restaurant. It was the most magical anniversary celebrated since our wedding day :) 
As one enters Close Maggiore, you are immediately greeted by the hostess to check in and have your coats received. The hostess will then bring you into the waiting room with a beverage of your choice. The waiting room is dimly lit for a sexy and foxy ambiance.  
Hubby made a late reservation at 9:30pm. Feedback states you are most likely to get a seat in the observatory with a later reservation than with an early reservation. This feedback was true as we had did get a table in the observatory. A nice cozy corner table to snuggle together under the stars on a romantic and magical December night :) 
The whole restaurant is beautiful and breathtaking, but the observatory is unforgettable. The conservatory is a fully retractable glass roof that is normally adorned with cherry blossoms. When we visited it was adored with rustic wood branches intertwined with greenery, Christmas lights, and Christmas ornaments. The lighting was romantic with a fusion of the starlight sky above, crackling warm fireplace in the back, Christmas lights everywhere, and a delicate candle lit on our table. 
Chef Marcellin Marc's love of Provencal can be experienced not only in the decor, but also in the cuisine. The dishes created from sourced local and seasonal products throughout the year to create their awarded AA-rosette award menus. One can read more details about the sourcing of ingredients on their website. It is quiet fascinating. Hubby and I both ordered items from the seasonal tasting menu. The quality of the ingredients are exceptional. One can taste the quality in every bite. 
Clos Maggiore believes that wine is a fundamental part of dining. Therefore they a dedicated team of Sommeliers that visit vineyards and taste hundreds of wines a year. This teamwork has produced a globally renowned wine cellar that boasts an extensive 2500 options from 18 different countries and four centuries. The restaurant has won multiple awards for their wines including one of the highest and most prestigious accolades - 'The Wine Spectator Grand Award' - one of only 70 restaurants worldwide to have achieved this honour. Lastly, they now incorporate ""Coravin"" wine preservation system so you can order by the glass. 
Such a fabulous restaurant is not fabulous without its staff. The service deserves a round of applause. Outstanding from the minute of arrival to departure. Intimate service never left me sit waiting for the next course, or with crumbs on the table. Truly wonderful. My favorite was the surprise was at the end. The staff provided a special ""Happy Anniversary"" dish. This topped off an already beyond perfect night. Thank you! Words cannot express enough how thankful I am to the staff. 
London has so much to see and offer. I would highly recommend making time to visit this restaurant. It is on par with several one Michelin star restaurants in London. In addition, it's not just a restaurant, but an experience you will remember for many years. 
Thank you Clos Maggiore!",1
2,"Honestly, I don't think this restaurant is worth it. We booked far in advance (online) but were seated upstairs where it's very plain and boring. The server kept rushing us to order, ended up giving us the wrong table's order, and seemed very uninterested in checking in to see how our meal was going. 
I specified on the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary but they didn't do anything special. 
When we went downstairs after the meal and wanted to see the beautiful conservatory, the servers seemed very reluctant to show it to us even though it was half empty! 
The food was decent, service was mediocre at best, and the atmosphere is only nice if you get the conservatory. I honestly wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my friends.",-1
5,"My husband and I first ate at Clos Maggiore last March 2018, in their restaurant because we couldn't get a table at the Conservatory.. I made a reservation months before our anniversary dinner last night, flying in from LA 2 days ago.. It was truly worth the wait!! It was a magical evening from the time we walked in, up to the time we left!! The service was excellent, the food was amazingly sumptuous, and the ambience is what you come to Clos Maggiore for!!
A definite experience of you want a romantic experience worth remembering!!
Thank you Julio for the cafe and extra delicious dessert!!",1
3,"It's taken me a while to muster up the courage to write this review. Mostly just because I made a reservation 6 months in advance because that's how long the wait time is, so naturally, I was expecting to be blown away. But shoot, how can you not put so much pressure on the place and have your expectations high as heck when you wait 6 months to eat there!? Basically, what happened was I wasn't blown away, and I was sad because I wanted to be. But whatever, I'm going to write about it mostly just for myself because I'm strange and enjoy re-reading my reviews and remembering the experience. Also people may be interested in my point of view, but I really don't want anyone to be put off from going here because of me. 
The conservatory room is the one room that has the ungodly wait for it. If you want a weekend dinner slot, it'll probably be more like 8 months + for a spot. They have plenty of other tables in other rooms that you don't have to wait that long for, but I was all about the special room because it's awesome to surprise yourself on a  random weeknight in January and the prices seemed semi-reasonable for a wait time like that. So anyway LETS GET TO IT! 
We were welcomed and they took our coats and seated us. They put us at a table situation in the middle of the room. It's a relatively small square room and there are tables placed in the corners and side of the room, and then there's a round one smack in the middle. We were at that table and it felt sort of in the centre of everything, not terribly intimate, and we had to sit across from one another so he felt sort of far away from me. It also gave the waiters 4 different angles to approach us, which meant we were checked on a lot. All of these things seem very minimal, but I guess they began to add up over time. We thought it would be a super calm, chill, and relaxing evening, but because there were so many people to take care of us it was not relaxing. Probably 3 different waiters tried to take our order before we were ready. It's not really their fault, that's just what happens when you don't have a set waiter for a set table I guess. I also asked to hold on to the menu, and a second later, another waiter took it up, because that's what happens when you have so many people attending to you! 
It was also quite funny, because there was so much confusion around the tasting menu. We wanted to know if it was possible to order a vegetarian tasting menu and also a fish only one, and they got quite confused. One waiter had to get another to come over and then another came over which made me quite embarrassed thinking that this question wasn't that big of a deal. It also felt like everyone was looking at us because we were literally in the centre of the room. In the end they told us we could only pick 2 options of the 5 and it was to the point where we just though, ""ok, I guess we should just stop asking questions"". I still don't get how the tasting menu works. 
The food was good. We had the Spanish octopus salad and crab and salmon roulade for starters. The octopus salad had plenty of sausage in it which I was not expecting. Ok ok, it does say ""Pig's Trotter Croquet and young leaves"" in smaller print underneath. Derp. The salmon roulade and crab was very tasty. 
For mains we had turbot and the truffle pasta with a side of truffle mashed potatoes and mushrooms. To be honest those sides were totally out of this world and I would have been happy just eating those with the complimentary cheese puff things they give you. Their bread (especially the focaccia! is also delicious. 
I really did enjoy the truffle pasta, but wasn't a fan of the turbot. The room is very beautiful and I can imagine it being even more lovely during the daytime with all the natural light and lovely flowers. We enjoyed the experience but my biggest compliant would be we were ""too taken care of"". Which is a thing. I felt rushed and we were checked on too often. Of course anyone should come here to experience it for themselves. This was just my experience.",-1
5,"This is truly the most romantic restaurant i have ever seen. The articles are right. The most memorable meal I had in London - from the high level of service to the exquisite food to the jaw-dropping romantic atmosphere. If you are a couple in love, this should be at the top of your restaurant bucket list. If you are a solo or group foodie, then dine in their well appointed dining room surrounding the romantic conservatory so that you can enjoy this fine meal without the sappy lovers swapping gazes. 
I'll start with the food because it cannot be overstated how much attention was placed to every taste detail. Even the salad left you wondering - how do they do it? Salad shouldn't taste this good. Get the salad.
I ordered the burrata with marinated beets - totally odd composition to me, but the chef pulled it off. As beautifully set as this dish was, the taste was better. Flawless. Get this one too.
For my entree I ordered the line caught cod. Bonus points to CM for the line caught fish. The flavors were subtle and enjoyable.
We had to get on to our show, so no time for dessert, but I could have stayed in that restaurant for hours drinking the fine wines they had available. I was impressed with the sommelier who did not suggest the highest priced glass of wine. He chose the perfect pairing for my entree.
Not only was the sommelier on point, every person from the hostess to the bread boy (?), the waiter to the manager was above and beyond knowledgeable and kind. Patient with my questions about the food and request for pictures, this team could not be thanked enough. I wanted to hug everyone there.
During our meal this woman showed up dressed in cargo pants and flip flops asking for a table here. The manager was nicer than I would have been but politely told her that the conservatory (where the flowers hang) books 6 months in advance and she could not be accommodated. I mean, you can see walking in that this is a very nice place - and you want to be sat looking like you just came off the fishing pier? Whaaaa? Who does that? Have some respect for yourself and the people who are all in there dressed nicely for a formal meal and t he proprietors who are trying to create a romantic ambiance. The moral of this story is make reservations far in advance and dress appropriately.
I am not a poet, as any words I could compose would fail to do justice to the flower heaven that has been created here, so look at my pics. I am lucky enough to have a very romantic boyfriend who takes me to many romantic restaurants, but Clos Maggiore is unique and will forever have top billing in my mind and heart as the most romantic restaurant. Save up and go here.",1
3,"Many publications name Clos Maggiore one of the most romantic restaurant in London, & rightfully so; however, sharing the experience of their fascinatingly beautiful conservatory with a friend or family member can be just as lovely. 
I made a reservation about 45 days in advance, & to be expected, only had my choice of time slots after 9pm. I chose 9:30pm which had the disadvantage of being too late to order the 5-course tasting menu (£65; might've been a blessing in disguise because I couldn't fathom eating another bite after just three courses), but also the benefit of getting a table in the much-coveted conservatory, which is draped in white cherry blossoms. I imagine the chances of being seated here during prime dining hours are nearly impossible, as there are only about 6-7 tables in the area. The cozy armchairs, warmth of the fireplace, & scenery that can be described as a page out of Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is an experience that we'll look back on fondly. 
While the ambiance is unbeatable, the food is nice, but not phenomenal. With each course, my satisfaction with the taste of the dish dwindled. I started with Crispy Polenta & Saint Marcellin Cheese, which has an interesting mix of toppings: grilled young broccoli, pickled pears, almonds, & salsa verde. The vegetarian main I chose was heavy & became quickly tiresome: papardelle with grated fresh truffle, mushrooms, parmesan, & truffle sauce. Dessert was a Baked Natural Greek Yogurt Cheesecake with citrus accompaniments, which lacked creaminess & instead had the consistency of a panna cotta. If I could re-do the meal, I'd choose a different main & dessert. 
The reason for my middle-of-road rating has to do with service. Our waiter was not engaging & disinterested, which made us feel ill-at-ease. Though we saw him walking around, he didn't stop to check on us. We ordered our desserts with a different wait staff member & my requests of no citrus was completely lost. Another miss was interrupting us several bites into our main to add an ingredient to our respective dishes (sauce for my dining partner's pork tenderloin, shaved truffles for my pasta.) I'm perplexed as to why this wasn't done within seconds of bringing out our plates, which seems the customary practice when a dish requires finishing touches. 
No one can deny the uniqueness or exquisiteness of the room for which Clos Maggiore is known. Their attention to customers (or rather, lack thereof) & unspectacular dishes -- well, those are subjects that are wide open for debate (& hopefully, improvement.)",-1
5,"Made a reservation for 4 people about a week before! The only option available was 9pm. I requested the conservatory, like everyone else, but when the restaurant called to confirm they said we'd be seated in the restaurant. We really enjoyed our dinner, although not in the ""romantic"" part of the restaurant, the service and food were great! We did the 3 course dinner and enjoyed every bite! Service is amazing and the Somali, wine expert, was wonderful! I had wrote in the reservation that my husband and I were celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary, so they surprised us with a sweet dessert and candle! Perfect night!",1
4,"AH the restaurant was just so pretty with all the flower towers. I had the truffle pasta. It was very simple taste and I loved it. My friend had the lunch special two course meal with foie gras and lamb chop. They were really good too! 
Their coffee was super good too. When we ordered the coffee it came with a set of three desserts! They were very nice.",1
5,"You get what you pay for. This is fine dining and memorable. The staff was attentive. The wine choices beyond excellent. 
The food preparation and presentation were stunning and all very tasty. 
After a week of so-called ""hot"" London restaurants, this was a lovely way to end the trip on a high note. 
The tasting menus were perfect so don't cheat yourself out of the wine pairings. 
Our new romantic London destination.",1
5,"Perfect!  Attentive staff, beautiful decor, quiet for conversation, terrific flow to the evening and the food?  Amazing.  Parpadella was fantastic, my pork loin was awesome.The Sommelier selected the best wine we've ever tasted and that's saying something.",1
5,"Just wow. 
This is the prettiest restaurant we've ever been to, and thankfully the substance more than matches the style. 
It all feels very authentically French, the service is exceptional and the food is exquisite. We went for the Sunday prix fixe 3 course plus wine for a reasonable £37.50. The crab and celeriac remoulade was stunning, the wife had wagyu beef (!!) terrine which was equally delicious.
Mains were pork neck with petit pois 'Francaise' and bacon sauce which was unbelievably flavoursome and totally delicious, the wife had truffle parpadella, with extra truffle - superb.
We also loved the desserts - Mille feuille and a vanilla cream cheese mousse with pistachio ice cream. A perfect way to finish the meal off.
Great looking wine selection too - we had a lovely Spanish Tempranillo with the meal, but the list was impressive. 
Overall a fantastic experience. Clearly a place for couples!",1
5,Make reservation in the conservatory room if you can! Once confirmed don't bail out on your reservation! They will charge you if you don't show up!!!!And do the tasting menu,1
5,"We had the opportunity to go for our 25th anniversary. From the time we walked In the door until we left, we were totally treated like special friends. My wife and I both had the chefs tasting menu and had the paired wines. The sommelier was spectacular and explained the wines to perfection and each one was perfect for each course, 5 in all. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone for a special occasion or for a spectacular meal. One of the best!",1
3,"food was good
service was good
ambiance was small quaint and beautiful!
very romantic.
I personally find the food over rated and expensive.  
I do enjoy fine dining but when it is worth the money!",-1
5,"If you're in London, this little gem off Covent Garden is a can't miss.
For starters, the restaurant itself is beautiful.
The service is impeccable.
The food is some of the best around.  Between the two of us, we had a tomato salad (actually a side dish that we got as an app) and a spring mix salad with truffle as starters.  Both were delicious.
Main courses were papparadelle with mushrooms and truffle (see a theme?) and fish.  While the fish was good, the pasta was the clear winner.  Wines were great and masterfully paired (we both got by the glass given our different main courses, and the somm matched them very well without resorting to the ""Coravin"" glass list).
Eat here...you won't be upset you did.",1
5,"If you want to impress a girl, this is the place to take her. Clog Maggiore is one of the most romantic restaurant i have been to in London.
Food
1. Tuna Tartare - This is not the standard tuna tartare with avocado and tuna chunks that we get in California. To my surprise, its marinated in vinaigrette and serve with zucchini, squash and other garden vegetables. Truly refreshing - 4/5
2. Triple cooked chips (British call potato fries chips) - Nothing special to be honest - 3/5
3. Honey glazed duck breast - This is the signature dish and its exquisite. The duck is cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. The honey glazed sauce compliments the duck so well and take away the gamey flavor of the meat. MUST TRY 5/5
4. Homemade Pasta in truffle cream sauce - They are very generous with the truffles and shave a bunch of truffles on the table side. I have had better truffle pastas but this was above average.  4/5
5. Creamed spinach - Standard 3/5
Decor
The conservatory seating area is very cosy and the lighting make it very romantic. The entire area is decorated in silk flowers to make you feel like you are in a garden in France. 
Pricing
This place won't break your bank. Price is reasonable consider the quality of the food, decor and service. 
Tip: Make sure to make a reservation in advance and request for the conservatory seating area. Its not worth it otherwise.",1
5,"Amazing find. Really is the most beautiful/romantic restaurant in the world. Try to sit in the conservatory if you can. Creative cocktails, great wine. Truffle parpadelle was amazing!",1
5,"If you are looking for fine dinning & a very romantic place you definitely have to come here. We booked our dinner for our 10 year anniversary back in June. When I made my reservation the only slot they had was for 10:30 PM. Normally this would be ok w/ me however we had our son w/ us during the trip & being jet lag it would be horrible to try to stay awake to enjoy your meal. So a couple days before we departed for London, I phoned them to confirm our reservation. I was a bit hesitant to ask but I did anyways, and asked if they had any opening at all for an early seating and just my luck one opened up for the conservatory area by the fireplace! The whole experience was just amazing! The food, the wine, the complimentary dessert was delicious! All the staff from our waiter, to the host (who helped me get the earlier booking) were just impressive! The place was just beautiful & very romantic! I heard they do a Christmas theme decor in their conservatory, which would be nice to see. On the repeat list for sure.",1
5,"We chose this restaurant because of the beautiful ""Most Romantic"" dining room, but we loved everything. They had an obscure bottle of wine in their ""bible"" that we had a long time ago on one of our first dates. The service was perfect. We also really enjoyed the cheese cart at the end of the meal. Definitely make a reservation.",1
5,"Still can't grasp just how magical this trip is. Hubs truly did it and made reservations awhile back to have dinner at Clos Maggiore. Named, ""The most romantic restaurant in the world."" And by all means this post is not meant in any way to boast but rather to suggest to you if you or know of someone that is a huge foodie or and looking for a beautiful experience in dining while in London please share this place on. My husband and I love trying different cuisines and wines when we can. So I truly would love to take a moment to share with you of this beautiful gem off Covent Garden in London. From the moment we walked in, the amazing food, impressive 2,500+ in international wine selection, and impeccable service are just few to describe of the wonderful experience we had when we were there. There is a 6-7 month wait list for reservations but is well worth it, so book ahead. A romantic and small French cafe from the outside leads you in to a warm greeting as they'll help you to your area of seating request. From that moment we were lost in words entering the most beautiful conservatory elegantly adorned with cherry blossoms above. We then met our waiter Hugo.Attentive, wonderful and just made sure we really enjoyed ourselves. He helped answered all of our questions, made sure if we had any food allergies, and thoroughly explained what each dish was and how it was prepared. We then tried the seasonal tasting menu which consisted of 5 dishes starting with: Handpicked dorset crab mayonnaise with green apple & mango salsa, followed by the most delicious Pan-roasted Les Landes Duck Foie Gras with Fig and Oat biscuit, Pan-roasted and smoked wild sea bass with smoked haddock and leek croquette, oven-roasted and herb smoked Íberiko pork loin with chorizo and sweet peppers. Every dish was decadent, flavorful and truly unique on its own but complimented the dish right before it perfectly. At this point-of-time I thought I had reached my limit on tummy capacity. I mean, how could I even possibly take another bite? But it's dessert! there's always room for dessert!We finished it off with Blackcurrant sorbet paired with champagne foam. Mind blown. Please be sure to give them a visit when you're in town, you truly won't regret it.",1
5,"I came here for the beautiful dining room, left was thoroughly impressed by the whole dining experience. The conservatory here is known as one of the most beautiful and romantic dining rooms in London, with delicate flowers and lights strewn in a canopy below a skylight, a nice fireplace, and a number of very well placed mirrors to make the place look much bigger than it is. I was surprised to find that there are only 7 tables in the room, which explains why you have to book 6 months in advance! Most tables were occupied by parties of 2 (lots of couples), but two in the corners were larger and seated groups of 3 or 4. There is an awkward table in the middle that ends up being watched by the groups of two, so try to avoid that one if you can! We saw a couple sit there and then were re-seated just a few minutes later (presumably they asked to be moved). We ordered from the rather affordable seasonal set menu (5 courses for £65) and opted for the wine pairing, which is £40 per person. The food was excellent and the wine pairing phenomenal, with unique wines like whites from Santa Barbara and a red dessert wine. They even accepted my substitution request without question when I wanted a dish from the vegetarian set menu instead of one of ones from the main set menu. Service was very quick and we didn't have to wait long for any dish, and the sommelier always just behind, ready with an explanation of why the wine was chosen for the pairing. In all, we finished 5 courses in less than 2 hours (that's my kind of fine dining!) I would recommend this for couples or special occasions, it's just such an incredible place and one of those quintessential London classics. But book ahead for the conservatory! Definitely worth the wait!",1
5,acceptable for any special occasion. able to enjoy your dining past kitchen hours too.,1
5,"We had to come back here for a 2nd time during our vacation in London. For the 1st time, I made reservations about 3 weeks early for our anniversary. I was hoping to sit in the Conservatory, but when I asked about it when we came in they said they were booked until December! That's 3 months!
So we were seated upstairs in an intimate room & had the seasonal tasting menu with wine pairing. I choose the vegetarian tasting menu & who knew vegetables could taste so good!! It really showed that the simplest dishes could still taste amazing & didn't need to sacrifice flavor! 
FOOD & DRINK HIGHLIGHTS
-Chargrilled Green Asparagus: Really asparagus? This was the best asparagus I've ever had.  I didn't expect too much from it by just looking at it, but it was SO DELICIOUS! My husband doesn't like asparagus & he thought it was amazing too. 
-Papardella with Truffle & Mushrooms: This dish was so decadent. Instead of adding freshly grated parmesan on top, they put freshly grated truffle on top! What?! & they add a good layer on top.
-Iced Green Apple Parfait: Wow. This was the perfect fall dessert. 
-Shetland Isles Mussel & Saffron Soup: I was obsessed with the mussels in London & I love saffron so I thought this was going to be really good & it was! 
Everything we had was amazing & the wine pairing was PERFECT! I discovered a new favorite wine of mine, Foradori Fontanasanta Nosiola. 
CONSERVATORY vs SITTING UPSTAIRS
First time when we were seated upstairs, it felt more intimate & service was very attentive. The team worked well with one another & everything flowed. There was never a time our water wasn't filled & they were ready for our next course when we were. It gave us a better chance to enjoy the food & the entire experience. The 2nd time we asked a couple days early if we could make a reservation & a reservation was just cancelled. We were so lucky that we got the middle table in the Conservatory! In the Conservatory, the team seemed a little more flustered possibly because the Conservatory & downstairs area is larger. The Conservatory was really beautiful & romantic!! Both experiences/rooms felt different, but we enjoyed Clos Maggiore very much. If only this place wasn't thousands of miles away from home!",1
5,"Perfect dinner for a perfect night. 
Outstanding food and great selection of wines.
We'll come back for sure",1
5,"I went last night for a meal I had pre-booked since last year. I chose this because of all of its famed reviews, reputation & such. Clos Maggiore lived upto the hype. Oh so very very well.
I had got the Conservatory room, the one its most famous for. However I wouldn't have minded either way. The other parts of the restaurant seep charm and grace. The food and service is second to none and never have I felt so special and cared for. I saw other reviewers saying they never got the conservatory and frankly, was it because I booked ahead? was it because we ate at 7pm when it was quieter, or was I lucky? Not sure. We were a couple and it was almost as if that room never had a table bigger than 2-4 anyway. Mostly it sat couples.
The food is to die for, im getting hungry again just thinking about it. I was tempted for the taster menu but we felt we would both have a starter, a main and a shared desert with coffee & Petit fours. 
Certainly it was pricey but it was a special anniversary meal that was worth paying for. Thoroughly recommend the place and want to go back asap!",1
4,"Wow! What a restaurant! I had the seasonal tasting menu with suggested wine pairings. It has been an amazing experience, all plates really delicious, well presented and well portioned. 
The sommelier paired excellent wines, none of them was disappointing and all of them a perfect match with the food. 
The atmosphere is lovely, waiters all nice and good. 
Absolutely a must go!!",1
5,"Incredibly beautiful restaurant. Perfect for a special occasion. The food, the service, and the ambience are second to none. We ate in the conservatory, and it was worth the advance request. We ordered the pork loin and the duck - both were delicious, not too fussy, every bite wonderful. We could not make room for dessert but were given the petit fours of the house, which were just perfect.",1
5,"This is an excellent place for a date, yet also a place for birthdays and just merely a day to treat oneself.    The service is excellent and the menu delicious.  The Michelin star is apparent in all that they do.  Though at the same time anyone would feel welcome in here. 
We had lamb, rabbit, duck in two forms, and many other delicious items.  Even the chips were top quality and uniquely done.  
The staff was very professional and the location theater reachable as that was in our plan.
The décor especially is very top notch.
DT",1
5,"Oh if only I had a man to dine here with! Clos Maggiore is without a doubt the most romantic restaurant in London - make sure you're seated in the beautiful rear conservatory. Made up to look like a French courtyard it has twinkling fairy lights and faux apple blossom. So pretty - somehow they managed to avoid tackiness. Summer is the best when the skylight is open.
Anyway, the food. It is really good - I'll admit not the best French/Mediterranean in London but let's face it, you're mainly here for the ambience. I highly recommend the pasta - I rarely eat pasta out but Clos Maggiore's really is superb. As is the confit duck. 
Service is fantastic. Friendly and attentive but not intrusive.
Oh and if you're a wine lover - they have a ONE HUNDRED PAGE wine list with over 2,500 wines!",1
5,"One of my all time favorite restaurants! The service was exceptional and the food was amazing! I have several allergies and they waved a hand and said ""not a problem!"" They even made me fresh warm gluten-free bread and it was delicious! That was really special to me since its often difficult to find food I can eat at restaurants. The atmosphere was very romantic. Next time I'm in London, I will be making another reservation!",1
1,"We booked a lunch reservation here 3 months before heading to London for our honeymoon, as there were no dinner reservations available. We were so excited about dining here. It was to be a highlight of our stay. We received a call and voicemail from the restaurant a week before our reservation and upon calling them back, I spoke with one of the rudest woman I have ever had the displeasure of speaking with. When I tried to get clarification on our reservation (I didn't realize there were two sections of the restaurant and was advised this via their voicemail) the woman on the other line was clearly annoyed that she had to explain this to me. After she explained there were two sections and we wouldn't be eating in the conservatory (the beautiful section you see in all their photos) she proceeded to tell me that in order to be seated in the conservatory, we would have needed to book our LUNCH reservation a YEAR IN ADVANCE. I have to put this is caps because it blows my mind that they wouldn't have this listed anywhere on their site. A kind ""FYI, most people who are seated in our conservatory book a year in advance"" or something of this nature would have been nice. Still, this wasn't an absolute no-go for us. What sealed the deal was the next thing she said... ""So, are you going to confirm your reservation or not?"" We were given no time to process what she had just said before that! Needless to say, we prefer not to have our food with a side of nasty attitude. Not only did she phrase everything as if to make it clear she thought the conversation wasn't worth her words, as soon as I said we wouldn't be confirming, she immediately hung up the phone. No ""Goodbye"", no ""Sorry to hear"", etc. We wouldn't have gone after that conversation had they paid for the meal and put us in the conservatory.  I can't believe people are still patronizing this place with a woman like her being the first impression everyone gets of their restaurant.",-1
5,"je te amo! (since the name of this restaurant is half French half Italian, I'd have to express my feelings for it the same way).
It apparently has the reputation of being one of the most romantic restaurants in London, and indeed it is! If you are lucky enough to get seated in the conservatory area, you'd find yourself in a midsummer night's dream kind of surrounding. 
I went with a group of 5 and we were seated outside of the conservatory, but that's okay, we are just a bunch of foodies looking for our next favourite dinner spot. It was still a very classy setup: leather couch, white table cloths, sparkling silverware and very polite (and funny) waiters. 
We ordered the tasting menu. The foie gras appetizer was amazing, and I loved the asian flavoured glazed duck . The peanut butter parfait was interesting, for me it was delicious, but I can see how some people wouldn't like it if they don't like peanut butter. 
Our waiters and sommelier were all super helpful, and fun to chat with. 
In general I enjoyed dining here very much and would definitely return here. Hopefully I can book a table within the indoor garden next time!",1
4,"Lovely romantic anniversary dinner paired with delicious wine by a fantastic sommelier, let down by the fact we weren't placed in the conservatory as promised.
Myself and partner ate here for our anniversary dinner in October, after I made reservations months in advance. We were welcomed into a beautiful restaurant with impeccably dressed staff, and seated just outside the conservatory; a beautiful intimate light studded garden scene. This is my only negative, and I'd asked and been promised to be seated in this area- so I seated faced away so she could look at it in bliss and I could stare at the well stocked bar.
Food was great- we ate the Pumpkin & Pine nut soup and the Braised Shoulder of Loire Valley Rabbit, Sweet & Sour Black Radish & Wholegrain Mustard Mousseline for starters. Delicious, really truly delicious. Even the bread basket was utterly morish, especially the rosemary focaccia. We asked for more, happily given.
Mains were the Oven Roasted Venison Fillet, season autumnal vegetables, truffle & potato mash, with a slow cooked beef & potato gratin side; and Slow Cooked Fillet of Scottish Cod 'Rougaille' Roasted Vermicelli, Mussel & Iberico Chorizo Fideuà. Venison was perfectly cooked, as was the cod. Felt the cod dish didn't hugely work together, but might be my personal feeling- didn't leave me with a 'wow' feeling unlike the rest of the food. 
Wine- The sommelier was extremely helpful and paired us two different wine wines for starters, and another white (for her) and deep red for my venison. I've completely lost my notes on what they were, but will update when I read their extensive wine list.
We were so full we skipped on dessert barring a decent but not special coffee. Which was fine as they brought out a plate with 'Happy Anniversary' written in chocolate and some cake. Nice touch and I had forgotten I'd told them!
Leaving I had a great talk with the front of house about their wine cellar whom nearly brought me down for a look but construction was going on. Next time!
Overall- 100% recommended. Expensive yes, coming in around £120, but once utterly worth it. Get into the conservatory however! It's magical.",1
4,"Dined in the flowery conservatory for my bday (waited 4+ months for the reservation!). The atmosphere and food was so beautiful, even though I really did not take a liking to the veal I ordered (first time trying veal). But my appetizer (Italian burrata, tomato and shaved truffle on pesto bread) and strawberry millefeuille dessert were incredible. My husband's chicken dish was actually much better than my veal. But...everything else was SO good that I already want to return.",1
3,They say it's the most romantic restaurant in London. I wouldn't agree. It's a nice French restaurant but there are many better options in the area.,-1
4,"Clos Maggiore has a well-deserved reputation as London's most romantic restaurant. It's convenient to the West End theatres, and open late enough to go after the show.
The food is reliable and elegantly presented, and the wine list ad Bas Armagnac are extensive and top notch.
But above all it's the romantic atmosphere of the garden-like (but completely indoor) dining room that draws us back.",1
2,"The ambience is unique, with open courtyard in the middle of restaurant letting in sunshine and plenty of flora decorations.  A true attention grabber attracting lady patrons. 
The food is more of rural French cuisine with too much sauce and oil making these dishes not becoming of fine restaurants. The over-emphasis on sauce and oil appear to overwhelm the less quality raw materials used. I had to return the halibut I ordered because it was NOT fresh (has ammonia taste, my partners duck breast tasted like liver somehow but we did not return it.) Service was good though as my food was replaced with another choice promptly and with good attitude.  
With so many choices in this neighborhood...why?",-1
5,"Fresh Maine Lobster, Scallops and Prawn Tortellini in Langoustine Bisque...this was the starter. Full of flavour. Every bite was an inspiration to the palate. The bisque was just the right consistency.  The service was impeccable and surprisingly quick. The ambience was beyond words. We were accommodated in the Conservatory - the romance of which melted my partners heart! They even celebrated our wedding anniversary with a complimentary platter of chocolate truffles. Definitely a five star experience!",1
2,"Had the potential to be the best meal of our trip to London based on food alone, but the service was perhaps the worst I've experienced in my adult life.  
The Aubergine appetizer, pork loin and truffle pappardelle were all delicious (though salad was way over seasoned even for a salt-lover), if the service were even moderately normal, I'd probably give 4 or 5 stars (or more likely, not bother reviewing since they are already so positively reviewed)
The server who initially took our order never returned to our table and we had 4 or 5 other waitstaff cycle through the meal, never asking how things were.  The wine I ordered was poured from the very end of the bottle, there was no offer of a tasting before the ""full"" pour, which looked quite short still when the bottle was emptied, but no top-off was offered from a fresh bottle.  Once we finished our first drink, glasses were removed from our table and we were never offered a second drink.  
The food was delicious, but difficult to enjoy given how hot it was in the restaurant. Once we were done with our mains, all we wanted to do was pay our check and get out into the cool air outside.  Unfortunately, we wound up sitting with our plates in front of us for an additional 20 minutes before they were cleared and a dessert menu shoved in front of us wordlessly, with the server abruptly departing before we could say ""check please!""  Another 20 minutes before a new waiter came over to ask if we'd like dessert, to which we finally replied ""no thank you, check please"". He then awkwardly asked if we were celebrating anything, and I quietly replied that we were on our honeymoon.  That was apparently a mistake, as he disappeared again only to emerge 15 minutes later with a giant ""congratulations"" plate arranged with a few small petit fours, a sweet gesture (though worth noting every table received the same treats at the end of their meals), but it took another 20 minutes after that before we were able to successfully wave down the manager for our check.
We encountered a few other services issues (including the manager arguing with kitchen staff), but I feel like I've already ventured too far into petty-town, you get the picture. 
tl;dr :  food = very good, wait staff needs management overhaul and proper training",-1
1,"The WORST dining experience ever had in my life so far. we were very angry and disappointed to the manager who is bald and wears black glass. Can't remember his name. But he had very rude and mean attitude to us asking us to leave and return back to our seat(which was in the main dining room) immediately while we were just taking photo in the conservatory, at that time there was only a few guests sitting there. After I told him that I just want to take some photos from here, this guy used loud and serious voice said :' other customers do not want to see people staying here( the conservatory), and do you understand what I mean?'  Well, i never seen a waiter being so rude and unfriendly to their customers from the Michelin star restaurant. And I guess I will write a formal letter to the institution tell the whole unhappy experience.",-1
5,"After a lukewarm review in the last fortnight by Grace Dent, I was reconsidering the wisdom of my choice to bring my wife here for our 4th anniversary.
I'm glad I stayed the course.
In terms of location - we did end up in one of those slightly sub-optimal places outside of the main atrium, but you know what? I didn't mind. Even the relatively pokey table we got (booking only 2 weeks in advance is apparently a rookie error) was actually fine. Would it've been nicer to be in the conservatory? By the looks of it yes, but the ambience was perfectly adequate. Granted, the whole ""most romantic restaurant in London"" vibe was missing, but it was still completely fit for purpose for a nice evening meal with a loved one.
Service throughout was absolutely spot on; from the girl who greeted us and took our coats, through to the sommelier and the food runners, all of the staff were attentive, jovial, and professional. As a restaurateur, my biggest pet peeve is bad service, but these guys didn't put a foot wrong. Nothing was too much trouble, and they balanced well the needs for discretion and engaging service. 
Breads looked superb in totality, though I never moved beyond their frankly sublime cheese focaccia. My opening piece which seemed to boast a schmear of ricotta in the centre was indisputably one of the finest breads I've had. 2 Further pieces lacked the same slightly sharp bite of cheese filling, but remained gloriously soft and flavourful.
Food was consistently good. Crab with smoked anchovy and cauliflower brought together 2 of my least favourite things into a very surprising dish. Paired with a wonderful Alsatian Riesling, it promised that the rest might well blow my concerns out of the water.
Foie Gras next, with roasted quince and gingerbread. Wonderful. A light touch from the kitchen, evocative of something I couldn't quite put my finger on, but it conjured up very warm feelings. Great little confit duck croquette. Served alongside a stunning Fiano orange wine, this was a great next step.
Cod with vermicelli and chorizo was one of the less exciting dishes. Beautifully cooked fish, with a lightly spiced pasta (they described it as more like a paella, which sort of makes sense in terms of the serve) was very pleasant, if not as demanding of oohing and aahing as other courses. 
Gorgeous duck with roasted plum and endive to follow. Slightly overcooked against the medium-rare that they recommended, but on the rarer side of medium, so hardly a travesty. My virtual thermometer may be off, but I know the Chef that night was French, so am surprised he erred towards better done. A stunning 2001 'Corullon' from Spain quickly smoothed over any slight wrinkles.
A last minute request for the cheese course was graciously obliged, and I'm incredibly pleased that it was so. A wonderful cross section, including Lancashire Bomb and Bleu St Jacques was superb, along with a cheeky Madeira. Biscuits are supposedly ""hand baked"", though they looked bought in. Very nice all the same.
We closed on a peanut butter parfait with a black sesame sponge which was a very interesting juxtaposition of flavours and textures. Not seen anyone convert black sesame into the almost seaweed-like sponge that accompanied this. The accompanying 2007 Jurancon was bang on the money - by far one of the better ones I've tried.
Petits Fours, coffee and Calvados, along with some complimentary eaux de vies, provided a very welcome rounding off.
All in all a very worthy location for a dinner, regardless of which table you get. I will certainly be popping back in (maybe even just for an impromptu course or two with a glass of wine, but can happily recommend it for any and all occasions. Fellow diners appeared to comprise birthdays, large groups, and informal post-dinner crowds, so the clientele is an interesting mix, though it seems like a degree of pre-planning is required to have any certainty of a table.",1
5,every dish was seasoned and executed just right; very small restaurant with small rooms,1
5,"Great place for a romantic dinner. We arrived a little underdressed as we had been out for a day of sightseeing and didn't have time to get back to our hotel and change. No one balked at our attire. Instead, the politely took our coats and seated us in a cozy room with a fireplace that was much welcomed by us after a day in the rain.
We both ordered the tasting menu and I had the paired wines. Before each course was presented, the wine steward presented the bottle at the table and explained a bit about the wine as well as their reasons for choosing it to compliment the dish.
The scallops were perfectly cooked-- deliciously seared on the outside. Foie gras with pear and this crispy little semi sweet cookie was out of this world and paired with a Gewurtztraminer from Washington. Lamb chops were succulent and they brought an amazing cheese course with four fabulous cheeses, crackers and quince jam. Dessert was a molten chocolate cake... so gooey and delicious, served with a Sauterne!? It was heavenly!
Service was a little stiff but wonderfully efficient and informative.
The tasting menu was great value, I won't confess to know what the bill was since my boyfriend paid-- I know it wasn't cheap-- but the quality and presentation were outstanding. Coupled with the fabulously cozy and romantic decor, it made for a wonderful evening.
I would recommend this restaurant to couples--possibly small family gatherings. It's definitely an intimate environment. I think a large group would be better off to book a private room here.
We would happily return to Clos Maggiore the next time we are in London.",1
4,"Everything was almost perfect. Would give this a 4.5 if I could. 
Tried the prefixe menu. I had the ""tartare"" starter which was kind of weird and not really a tartare. My husband had the asparagus soup which was quite good. But our main courses made up for it. Had the scallop and pollack over linguine. Probably too many calories but worth every single bite. Ryan had the beef which was so tender.
Service was great except when I asked for tap water and they gave us bottled. lol smh.
Definitely very pricey so definitely save for a special occasion! I was dressed relatively casual (just came the London eye) and was a little embarrassed. However they still welcomed us!",1
4,"we sat in the main dining room...not the conservatory which was disappointing but they tried to get us in. i made the reservation like six weeks in advance. we dressed up in suit/dress but we saw people in there with jeans fyi. 
the food was all very good, not amazing, not terribly expensive compared to ledbury/heston/clove club.
the main purpose of this place is the atmosphere. your stomach wont feel dissapointed, but it wont be the best meal youve ever had. if you go you need to book very far in advance to get conservatory.",1
3,"The surrounding and setting of the restaurant is amazing, taking you into a Midsummer's night dream and out of London for that moment. There are too many tables for my liking, as it takes away from the romantic or sentimental moment to be shared in such a beautiful setting. A much better spaced out and ambiance setting for romantic meals would be Greenhouse in Mayfair.. but completely different price point.
As for the food, I found the A La Carte a better option than the given tasting menu. The food is quite greasy and cooking skills were not put to test with the presentation similar to that of a posh school dinner..? Best way to describe it !
So 3/5 given for the overall experience. My suggestion would be to have a drink and a view of the main room. And save your appetite for a better eatery.",-1
5,"I went here in the summer two years ago. The only restaurant in London that I will always remember - best ambiance I've ever seen, very romantic. Food is awesome - from starter to entry, from drinks to dessert. Just love everything~",1
5,"This place is fantastic. I'm not a foodie, but even I could tell it was something special. I went with 2 others, and we had a 3 course meal and wine. The dishes are plated beautifully, the service is exemplary, and the food is absolutely to die for.
As an appetizer, I had the ""Fresh Maine Lobster, Scallop & King PrawnTortellini"". The scallop is sweet and tender, the lobster is succulent. For the main course, I had the chicken leg stuffed with sausage. Again, the perfect seasonings and tastes. I wasn't overly impressed with the mashed potatoes and carrots that we ordered as sides. Finally, I had pralines and toasted hazelnuts, which was a perfect end to an incredible feast. The setting is incredible with the indoor garden theme as well. Well recommended, even if you're not going as a couple - the food alone is worth it!",1
3,"This is an old school, attentive, formal and fussy french restaurant. Initially I found it all, including the staff, a bit over bearing, and just too formal for my liking. I also thought they seemed a bit unreasonably annoyed with us as two of our party were very late. However I think they did warm up to us, or perhaps we just warmed to them.
Our party was too large to sit there, however smaller groups of four of less can sit in the light and very pretty 'garden' area underneath pink (and surely artificial) blossoms.
The a la carte is not available on weekends. There's a three course set menu only, which actually makes financial sense given that it includes half a bottle of wine.  On the set there were only a limited number of dishes I could order due to my fussy diet - there were many dishes that seems ok on the surface and then on closer inspection were stuffed with shellfish and pork (things I do not eat). I ordered a very delicious gazpacho soup, followed by an intense and tasty duck and a very interesting nougat glace for dessert.
I came out of lunch clutching my stomach for over consumption of so much rich food over three courses (not including the really yummy foccacia at the start!). Overall it was good and I did enjoy it, but the restaurant was just a bit too traditional in attitude for my liking. 
It was also a bit of a shock to find out they actually charged on the bill for the seemingly complementary petit fours served at the end. We were so full at the time, we could have very easily skipped them. Very cheeky and underhand Clos Maggiore, very cheeky of you indeed.",-1
5,"If you're looking for a romantic, quiet, and intimate place: go to Clos Maggiore in Covent Garden.
I went for my first time (but definitely not my last time) last week.  I highly suggest the prix fixe menu, I had foie gras and egg bread, grillled cod with vermicelli noodles, and an apple crumble with creme anglaise.
In addition, if you're mad about wine, this place is perfect for you. The wine list literally goes on for days.
Really nice atmosphere and impeccable service. Well worth the money!",1
3,"I wanted to treat my family to a nice meal on our vacation in London while still trying to maintain a budget since the exchange rate is horrible against the dollar.
I read in a few traveler guides that the £19.50 3 course pre fixe was a good value at Clos Maggiore. I suppose considering the cost of most meals in London we did get a decent value but was expecting more from this restaurant.
The conservatory room is gorgeous and intimate. Since it was a clear day they opened the retractable glass roof which brought in a nice fresh breeze. Only issue with that was little black seeds, that looked like rat droppings, kept falling from above onto diners.
Our head waiter was a strange. He had to go over our orders multiple times and had to look over the menu more than once after I gave my order. I think a restaurant of this quality should have waitstaff that are familiar with the menu. At one point he chased me down on my way to the bathroom to clarify one more time what my starter was even though 3 of us ordered the same thing!
The food was just average and the options were rather limiting. I ordered the pork terrine and thought it was good but my sister likened it to fancy spam. My hubby ordered the crab mousseline for his starter which had an supplemental fee of £5 and not worth it. Bisque was more like a foam and the portions of scallops were small.
For entrees, I had the guinea fowl and everyone else ordered the red mullet w/smoked haddock risotto. I found the smoked fish flavour very overpowering. The mushrooms on my dish were tasty albeit on the salty side. I've never had guinea fowl but it tasted like old chicken and not very tender.
my mom's favorite part of the meal was the plum tart dessert. 
I don't think my family was too impressed with the meal.",-1
5,This was an accidental find using Yelp. The service and food was impeccable. I had their Sunday three course selection with wine. It is out of this world. You need to stop by! A reservation is highly recommended.,1
5,Food was a work of art in look and taste. The conservatory was lovely. I would not have enjoyed a table in the main walkway as it would have spoiled the effect. Everything we had was exceptional! Best food I have eaten in 5 visits to London -hands down!,1
3,"We came here for a fancy dinner to celebrate our engagement.
The food wasn't memorable at all, but we ordered the cheapest champagne (still around £30) and it was the best champagne I've ever tasted. I'm still dreaming about that champagne.
In terms of special, we couldn't sit in the garden-y area because we didn't book far enough in advance (impromptu proposal and all), and we told 2 waiters that we just got engaged and were celebrating and neither particularly cared. ""Uhh okay, so here are the specials.""
A lot of buck, not much bang. Great potential though, and it is very pretty inside.",-1
4,Very classy and nice intimate restaurant.  The food is delicious and the staff is very professional.  For the quality of the food the service was exceptionally quick.,1
5,"My brother took me here as a birthday treat and I highly recommend this place. The ambiance is amazing. It's busy & buzzing but not loud and rushed. Everyone that paid their bills looked satisfied, including us.
The services was excellent, however one of the waitress did get our tea mixed up. We have informed the other waiter as we were leaving about the mix up and he apologised on behalf of her.
The smoked steak was out of this world. I highly recommend this main course if you ever visit this restaurant. It simply melts in your mouth and took you to a different universe and back! 
I highly recommend this place if you want to treat yourself or for a special occassion.",1
5,"Intimate, romantic restaurant with outstanding service an amazing wine list  and really excellent food. 
If you enjoy fine French food then this is one of the best French restaurants in London. If you are a wine lover then it might be the best. 'Nuf said.",1
5,"Simply the benchmark: perfect service, superb, nuanced food, the perfect  place for a leisurely dinner with good friends.  I have had the pleasure twice, and cannot wait to repeat it.",1
3,"Spend New Year's Eve there. Fortunately we were placed in the best room. Still the food quality was not better than the three stars given by me. Service was good, but 12% service charge ended up in 40£ tips. Incredible, but do you start an argus five minutes before New Year's Eve?",-1
3,"This is a place with a really nice interior but, and here is the most important part you need to know about Clos Maggiore, when booking a table make sure you ask for one in the conservatory. This is the section in the back with the skylight and is definitely the best section to sit in, especially if you are taking someone out for dinner.
 The food was good but not the kind to blow you away. For main I had the roast chicken and I was not entirely convinced it was completely cooked. It is the kind of place you would go for good but not great food but a very nice atmosphere.
 Recommended for when you're taking someone out. Remember, conservatory...",-1
5,"The one at Clos Maggiore was an amazing experience. This elegant French restaurant, rated in the Michelin Guide, is perfect for a romantic dinner. The food was excellent: we had the fortune to be served by an italian waiter who recommended and explained us some dishes otherwise a little ""misterious"" and even if we spended a bit every dish was worth the price. Absolutely recommended.",1
5,"Just the sort of place we love. Relaxing, romantic, good service, reasonable value. I'd heard this was the most romantic place in London. We didn't get to experience the outdoor area which looks like a fairy tale in pictures I've seen but it was most certainly romantic indoors! The low lighting, wood, reds and greens make for a beautiful decor and the menus are indulgent enough for any special occasion. It's quite hard to book a table but we ended up walking in spontaneously on a Wednesday night around 8pm and had no issue sitting straight down. We took the seasonal tasting menu which is reasonably priced at £55/pers (without wine). The five course meal was delicious, portions are not very big but by the time we'd finished we certainly weren't hungry. The food is rich, flavours very well brought together and produce of great quality. There's no particular risk taken on the food associations - foie gras/duck and fruit, fish and chorizo... But sometimes traditional is just right, especially when you are out for a classy date. If you're not a pudding person please don't skip this one - it was the culinary highlight of the meal. Loved it, looking forward to going back. Would probably try a la carte next time or go back when new season kicks in on the tasting page. Or maybe even try the veggie tasting menu...",1
4,"Went here before a matinee at the Royal Opera House. So we told them we did not have much time. It was not a problem for them. We managed a three course meal in one hour comfortably.
The food is really lovely. The wines superb. The location and decor could not be better really. All in all, a wonderful lunch.",1
5,"A friend recommended that while my husband and I took our honeymoon in England to have dinner at Clos Maggiore. Our dinner at Clos Maggiore was not only the best of our 10 days in England, but one of the best of our lives. The atmosphere is so romantic and intimate. The service is of the highest quality. And the food is just divine. Don't skip on ordering the truffle mashed potatoes.",1
3,"OK if you're on account but not worth the money if you're picking up the bill
Pros: The conservatory in the back with the ceiling that opens up is nice, and if you don't mind a bit of camp the foliage decor can be sweet. Solid service.
Cons: Decent food but not worth the mark-up. For a nice meal, there are so many better options in Covent Garden. 
Not much more to say",-1
5,"One of my favourite restaurants in london. 
The first time we went we were fortunate enough to be sat in the conversatory, which is very beautiful and definitely got me some brownie points with the girlfriend!
 Unfortunately not managed to get a seat there since but the food and service is excellent whichever partf the restaurant you end up being sat in.
Throughly recommend and always visit when its a special occasion.",1
4,"Boy was I in for a treat!  My boyfriend and I always look like such an odd couple when we meet for lunch.  I wear some punk rock looking sweatshirt or t-shirt with jeans and trainers and he's in a really expensive suit.  Doesn't mean we don't have a common love of good food.  I often wonder what people think when they see us together, especially when we turn up in nice restaurants.  
Today we went to Clos Maggiore for lunch and arrived without a reservation literally at the end of lunch service.  They seated us anyway and even took my jacket and hung it up, nice.  
I have a new love for lunch prix fixe menus.  I'm sure dinner is off the charts expensive at this place, but for lunch they had an amazing prix fixe menu!  3 courses or 2 courses and a 1/2 bottle of wine for 19 pounds.  Killer!!!!  
I don't think I've ever had such good service without the waiters barely saying a word.  The place looks like a place where high end business happens, a really unique interior.  
We both ordered off the prix fixe and it was DELICIOUS!  Whenever we go out to eat my boyfriend always asks if I'd like some of his food.  I've come to learn that by saying that, what he really means is ""can I have some of yours?""  Now that I've deciphered the code we always discuss what we're ordering before hand so we'll both be happy to ""share"".  
Starters:
Seared Tuna - This was delicious, it came with a pastry, almost baklava type pairing, and a wonderful sweet bruschetta.  Sweet cheeks literally cut the starter in half so we could switch once we'd eaten our allotted halves.  
Pea and Mint Soup - Wonderfully rich and creamy, yet light at the same time, and had broad beans as well.  Came with some addictive cheese bread on the side.  Bring on Round 2!  
Mains:  
Slow cooked beef cheek - I can't say I've ever had ""beef cheek"" but it was delicious.  Very tender and the meat effortless pulled apart.  Was accompanied with a very rich sauce and green pea pods with carrots. I will now add ""beef cheek"" to dishes I want to try at home!
Monkfish - I've never been a huge fan of fish, but this was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The outside was nice and  crispy and soft on the inside.  It came with prawns as well.  Both mains were delicious.  
I had the 3 course and got the coffee and petite fours for dessert.  They were 6 scrumptious little samples of YUM!  I said that anything that is gold dusted will most certainly be delicious and I was right!  
I love deals, I love good food, I love good service, I love ambiance.  All of which I got at Clos Maggiore for lunch!  Party!",1
5,"This is possibly one of my favourite restaurants in London. Nestled only a short walk away from bustling Covent Garden is this extremely cute little place.
What is most striking is its interior. It is in a Georgian townhouse, and as soon as you enter you just feel like you're in a different world. Their website describes it as a 'romantic remembrance of stylish country inns in Provence and Tuscany', and they couldn't be more right. 
I have always dined in the conservatory of the downstairs dining area, with only around 7 tables, the space is very small, however you don't feel cramped at all. The ceiling is high, topped with a glass roof, allowing lots of natural light, and accentuated with the soft yellow glow of side lamps dotted around the room. Cherry blossom flowers are weaved around the walls, and at the end of the room is a fire place, it is simply the epitome of cosy and intimate. 
Unlike many high-end restaurants, the food comes in decent portions, and is well presented in a very creative manner. The menu is warm and filling from just reading through it, with a fusion of French flavours, and the ingredients are always fresh and  according to season. The dishes are hearty and sumptuous with such things as 'roasted fillet of 'Duke of Westminster' venison with prune and turnip gratin and bitter chocolate sauce', or 'treacle caramelised breast of Gressingham duck with poached figs, ruby port sauce.' 
The desserts are always perplexing to me as I can never seem to envision what exactly will be served from just looking at how it is described on the menu, but nevertheless, I am always impressed. 
They have a 3 course lunch menu for just under 20 pounds, an extensive, award winning wine list, and the staff are friendly and extremely attentive, but they don't linger. 
All in all, a very impressive place worth every penny for a visit!",1
5,"Superior service, beautiful decor, and terrific food.
Bring a wine expert (the list is extensive) and plenty of money.",1
5,"Intimate, gorgeous, delicious, romantic.  All that plus the best mashed potatoes I have EVER HAD.  Request the conservatory, we had the center table and were in heaven.  Don't miss this spot, the food was delicious and the wine list was fantastic and thorough.",1
5,"Lauded as one of London's most romantic restaurants and just a short stroll from Covent Garden's Piazza, Clos Maggiore is a winner of a setting for a date. The accolades have as much to do with the restaurant's dreamily cherry blossom-filled conservatory as with the menu  which is gorgeous. As far as I can tell anyway: I've only been once and that was to sample their ultimate chocolate menu coinciding with Chocolate Week back in October (2010). The six course tasting menu was as intriguing as it is luxuriant - more a gourmet dining experience than merely a nice meal - and, when paired with their specially selected wines, yielded a delicious flight of flavour for contemplative foodies with sophisticated palates and a sheer delight for any palate otherwise.
 Service is exceptional, the location is convenient and the wine list rocks!
 I'm keen to return for a go at Clos Maggiore's regular menu. In fact, I've already made the rez.",1
3,"To commemorate my last night in town, I wanted to find an especially wonderful restaurant. We've had quite a bit of scrumptious food, so there was a lot to live up to. After taking into account all the advice from Yelp and various other sites, I selected this Covent Garden French eatery. Supposedly the BEST French restaurant in all of London, I was told. Perhaps even the best restaurant of any cuisine in London.
Puh-lease. This place isn't even the best restaurant on this STREET. 
I had booked weeks in advance and we got put in the cave of the upstairs private room. Those wanting to dine in the lovely conservatory be warned - specify on your reservation.
To their credit, my tomato salad was delicate and ripe. My dining companion's scallops were perfectly cooked. Our entrees, on the other hand, were mediocre at best. Nearly ""inedible"" tagiatelle and beef that was anything but gourmet. 
The service was slow but our waitress was good natured, if not taken aback by the fact that we didn't come close to finishing our dishes.
We booked it out of there and luckily caught a window at our favorite restaurant for dessert. (see Scott's Restaurant)",-1
3,"Slightly disappointing, but maybe because I expected too much.
 Some tables are better than others. My table was too close to the next one, and didn't have the sparkly pretty lights near it! :-)
 Food was good without being exceptional. Service was a bit slow and didn't feel special.
 Very pretty restaurant if you have a nice table, with/near the fairy lights!",-1
5,"The best meal we had was the first evening in London. The service was attentive, accommodating, and friendly. The ambiance was intimate with dark woods with an accent mirror, and a fake hedge that added a bit of romance to the dining experience. The menu is contemporary English cuisine with European and Asian influences. Each course was beautifully plated and tasted even better!
I started with braised shoulder of Loire Valley rabbit - so good! The main course was fabulous; treacle caramelised Gressingham duck breast with roasted red plums, sautéed bok choy, and ruby port sauce. The excellent meal ended with an amazing desert; Amalfi lemon & olive oil tiramisu (fresh Amalfi lemon & thyme sorbet). The sorbet was the best I've ever had and I've had some really fabulous artisan sorbet from Capogiro in Philadelphia and a pink peppercorn sorbet at Chikalicious in NYC but the thyme sorbet tops it all!",1
4,"The food is exquisite, and the ambience is intimate - despite the jungle of plants. Perfect for a romantic meal, or entertaining an important client. Abandon the no-carb diet - the bread is superb as is the selection of cheese and hand baked biscuits at the end. Good wine list as expected.
The only thing that lets it down is the varied customer service - there are some very rude and pretentious staff there. 
We were a party of two, we had a three course meal, two bottles of wine, the bill was about £160. It was worth it.",1
5,"Good food, wine and service right in the middle of London without being a tourist trap.
 Take someone special to impress them and expect to pay for it too.
 Only thing I would say is that they allocate the best tables to those that book first so if it's a last minute booking, dont expect to get the extra wow factor of this setting.",1
4,"We had a delightful lunch here in November. The bread basket full of home-made rolls was generously offered and the lobster and crab soup was a triumph with accompanying mozzarella bites. The main course of red mullet was professionally executed and the service was attentive. 
We sat near the door as we forgot to ask to sit in the conservatory on booking, but the ambience was still good.",1
5,"Date of our visit 5th March 2011.
Let's keep it short. 
It's been one of the best restaurants we have ever visited.
Amazing ambience including the toilets, interesting food, impressive selection of wine, attentive&discreet service.
It definitely exceeded our expectations. 
P.S.  Check your bill before you pay... in case you were charged for some unexpected items ;-)",1
4,"Best desserts!! If you go there, GET DESSERT!
Right next to Covent Garden.
Get a table in the main dinning area. It's feels like you are in a garden and if the weather is nice, they will open up the roof. Def a place you can bring guest to impress as I have done (in-laws and friends).
Service is inconsistant, one time I didn't enjoy my fish dish as it was quite bland (but other times I've been there the food has been fresh, well cooked, flavored, presented).",1
5,"In today's world, there are few restaurants that still make you feel special when you walk in the door.  This describes the service that you will receive at Clos Maggiore.  The waitstaff is very well trained, they all welcome you by name, and the service is impeccable.
My wife and I went to Clos Maggiore to celebrate my birthday.  It's one of those small, intimiate, romantic settings - I certainly wouldn't bring kids here.  I'm a huge wine enthusiast - so I was thrilled when I saw the school textbook-sized wine menu.  I think it was 90+ pages.  The great part is that the wine list was organised by the sommelier's recommendations, then by grape, then by region.  Trust me - there is a bottle of wine for everyone here.  We were particularly pleased with the French wine selection.  Just having returned from Burgundy, we were able to find several of our favourites on the list.
In terms of the food, we decided to go with the tasting menu.  The first course was marinated scallops with charlotte potatoes and seaweed salad.  This was accompanied by a really nice Sauvignon Blanc from Tinpot Hut.  Our second course was a fantastically prepared pan fried duck foie gras and a crisp confit duck leg.  My wife really enjoyed the wine compliment - a riesling kabinett from Mosel, Germany.  For our third course, we had a very nicely prepared slow cooked fillet of Cornish cod.  It was served on a bed of butter beans and sauce rougaille.  This course was accompanied by my favourite wine of the evening:  Marsanne, Qupé 2008 Santa Barbara County, California.  A French couple owns this US-based vineyard and they make terrific wine.  It reminded me much of a nice white Burgundy from the Chassagne-Montrachet area.  For the fourth course, we had my favourite course of the night:  treacle caramelised breast of Gressingham duck.  This was served with roasted red plums, endive meuniere, and a ruby port sauce.  The accompanying wine was also very well paired - a Barolo from the Marchesi di Barolo producer in Piemonte, Italy.  Our fifth course was a fairly standard cheese plate.  To be honest, this was my only disappointment all night.  They did not bring a cheese trolley over to the table and pre-selected all of the cheeses.  Many of the cheeses were also stinky soft cheeses, which I am not entirely keen on.  Nonetheless, it was paired with a nicely
with walnut  and raisin rye flour bread biscuits and quince jelly.  The
Barros Late Bottled Vintage Port from the Duoro Valley was also nice to cut through the cheese.  The sixth and final course was a Valrhona chocolate and griottine fondant served with cherry sorbet.  I probably could have eaten this for all six courses.  It was paired wonderfully with a reserve muscat from Yalumba NV Victoria, Australia.  This was a nice ending to a wonderful meal.  They even spelled ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate for our special occassion.
Don't miss a chance to eat at Clos Maggiore.  Leave plenty of time to enjoy your meal and use if for a special occassion!
TIP:  Book in advance.  This restaurant is fairly small and cannot accommodate a large number of people.  Use Open Table to secure your booking in advance.  Also, check with the host to see if you can be seated in the centre of the restaurant near the fireplace.  Very romantic!",1
5,"The place is really nice, it is first class restaurant. We had dinner here together with my girl and had a really good time. Loved the steak and she had something with vegetables, did not remember what , but she was really happy.",1
4,"We picked this restaurant based on ylep's review.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  We didn't have a reservation and the restaurant was very busy, but the hostess seated us pretty quickly.  We order a bottle of white wine based on their recommendation.  It was priced fairly.  I had sea bass and my daughter had duck, both entrees were excellent.  The wait staff was very attentive and the decor was intimate/calming.  I would definitely go back again.",1
2,"Tucked away from the chaos of Covent Garden we stepped into the hedge maze from the Shining for what would end up being an odd experience. I have never seen a bigger drop off from back of house to front, but that is just what we got. Even though we booked at least one month out, we were seated at the first table in the bar. We asked about being seated elsewhere, and were told that we had not requested the dining room and this would be our table. Next time I guess I'll inform them of my desire to eat when placing my dinner reservation. This set the tone for the pretentious service we would have all night. The large table next to us was halfway through the meal and the staff still managed to spill three times on them. I think the only ""apology"" one poor guy who had coffee spilled all over his suit received was a napkin. Staff was not too helpful with selections and every interaction was curt, if even a word said. We heard tables ask about the need for side dishes.  The staff did not really respond, instead they just placed an order for more food. The entrees are huge and the sides largely untouched. 
Thankfully, that moves us on to the food which was fantastic. We started with grilled scallops served on mashed potatoes. 
Entrees were a dry aged Scottish ribeye, gratin potatoes and haricot verts. It was served a bit undercooked when the knife finally arrived for me. It was a large cut and a sizable portion compared to many taster sizes at similar restaurants. 
We finished with a very tasty lemon meringue before waiting a long time on our bill. A fitting conclusion to two ends of the spectrum between very high quality food and terrible service.",-1
5,"been to this place a few times on special occassions, and have loved everything about this restaurant. Great food, service and atmosphere, and above all an awesome place to eat for romantic couples!!",1
5,"If you're looking to impress your other half take them here - simply the most romantic and impressive restaurant I've been to in London.
 We sat in the conservatory under the blossom - which is definitely the place to be. The service was warm, friendly but not overbearing.
 We tried a few dishes on the menu and I can't rave about it enough. Superb.",1
4,"My husband and I had dinner here last night. It is a cozy place, very intimate. The service was slow to start however, picked up after the first few minutes. We had just sat down and were given the menu when a seemingly nervous server asked if we would like an appetizer. I believe what he meant to ask us was if we would like an aperitif however, we asked to look at the menu first, and were given a lot of time to do so. Our Server was wonderful though. We ordered the seasonal tasting menu, my husband had the wine paring and I opted for a cocktail. The food was spectacular! The foie gras was to die for!!! Overall, an excellent dining experience.",1
5,"My favourite restaurant so far. In King's Street- the most romantic restaurant of London, I went for the Valentine's Day, we had a special menu pre-theatre. It's really expensive, you don't have a lot of food, but the bit that you have is delicious. Their wine list is the most extensive in London!",1
4,"It's a restaurant in Covent Garden, you would never imagine there is a terrace like that in there. It's cozy, for lunch, the lighting is like a movie set. It's rated the most romantic place in London, the food are small pieces, good presentation, the service extremely kind and attentive. You feel good in this place, its meant to be an intimate experience. They know what they are doing. Expensive, formal and conservative.",1
5,"Absolutely superb restaurant - very romantic setting and a perfect combination of Italian and French food. Great attention to detail from staff as you would expect from a restaurant of this calibre.
 I recommend asking for a table in the glass-roofed garden area (gazebo?) - in winter there's a wonderful fireplace.
 The quality of the food really shines through - Expensive but very nice restaurant.",1
5,"Clos Maggiore is one of my favourite restaurants in London. I've been back several times, each time.. bringing a different group of friends - service and food has not disappointed me once.
 In terms of French cuisine, Clos Maggiore consistently whips out exquisite concoctions that whet one's appetite
 I've always gone for the pre-theatre menu (best value on Sundays where it's 3 courses at £19.50 with no limit on early time slots), but even then, each course served on this reduced price menu is impressive and unforgettable.
 The forcacia bread is one of my favourites try it!
 The restaurant is always full, so booking is essential. In fact, do not be surprised if you're told that they are full and you have to make a pre-booking for another date.",1
5,"One of my favourite intimate restaurant in London - good food, good service and one of the most extensive (and all things considered affordable for London) wine list I know in the city.
 Their set lunch menu is great value.",1
3,Bit formal but you know by the end of the night you feel you have been treated special.  I enjoyed it.,-1
5,"Gorgeous food & great service.  This place is such a treat - glamorous, cosy, frivolous and as expensive as you want it to be.",1
4,"Clos Maggiore in Covent Garden had excellent service and good food, apart from slightly tough lamb. Waiting staff remembered mention of birthday celebrations without having to be reminded on the day - candle in dessert and happy birthday was a nice touch. Also, conservatory is lovely (and romantic), but if you sit near the fire place you get a cold blast of air. Overall, enjoyed another great meal at Clos Maggiore and we will be visiting again soon.",1
5,"In spite of the name, this is a great French (not Italian) restaurant in Covent Garden; expensive but worth it. Good intimate décor (especially if you like foliage), amazing wine list and very good food. Fantastic rabbit starter; very good meats. Pleasant service but could be more attentive. 
Ideal to impress the in-laws or for a romantic dinner.",1
4,"If you're in London with a niece and looking for somewhere to mutter sweet nothings into each others ear, then Clos Maggiore is the place for you.
 Packed to the rafters prior to theatre, once the luvvies have disappeared, the place really comes into it's own. The lighting is subtle, the conservatory - if you can get a table there - is delightful and the service matches the sublime elegance of the food to a tee.
 The wine list can appear as a bit of a shocker but, put your pretensions in your back pocket and even the cheapest wines on the extensive menu are wonderful.
 Pretty much all the dishes appear to be a smidge heavy on the truffles which, whilst delightful, can leave you feeling that you won't be needing a kebab on the way home.
 The pace is unhurried and friendly, and the waiters more than willing to make sensible suggestions for both food and wine.
 A really lovely and relaxing way to wind down after a day in town.",1
5,"We came here with some friends recently to sample the set menu - a very reasonable £20 for a delicious three course meal. You do take a hit on the wine, so it's worth coming here prepared to spend quite a bit of money but well worth it once you do.
 This place has a lovely cosy and relaxed atmosphere to it - especially if, like us, you are lucky to be seated at one of the booths. The food is scrum and the service was attentive without being overbearing. We were supposed to vacate our table by a specified time but the staff were v. relaxed and allowed us to leave in our own (reasonable) time.",1
4,"Delicious menu with a good array of seafood, red meat and poultry dishes. Style is French / Italian. Homemade bread was fantastic. Ambience is cosy and service is generally good. We have eaten here a few times and not been disappointed.",1
4,"This restaurant was a delight. Both service and food were exceptional. The ambiance is unusual with an interior garden but the effect is terrific. The wine list is also exceptional.
 Although Clos Maggiore is not cheap, it is still excellent value for money when compared with many of its peers.",1
5,"This is definably one favourite restaurants in London, it even has a vegetarian tasting menu! Can't wait to go again!",1
4,"Clos is beautiful and romantic, maybe the ambience is a littel bit too hushed if you were going with a big group of people for a birthday as we were, but if you're a couple who want to stare into each others eyes then it's perfect! Service was the perfect level of unobtrusive and the maitre d dealt brilliantly with a request for a wine from ahem the less expensive regions of the list! I also think the sunday prix fixe menu is fantastic value. Consideing that they are in Covent Garden one of the most tourist trappy places on earth and could churn out rubbish they really don't need to be this good.",1
1,"The staff mixed up our booking. 
We arrived before booked time and were told our table was given to someone else because they thought we booked for an hour earlier. I even showed them the email confirming the actual booking on my phone. No apologies, nothing. 
We were treated better in a sushi place. 
Very poor service. Not recommended.",-1
5,"We got a table under the blossom, near the fire, in the conservatory. It was just beautiful and so romantic as a setting.
 We had the tasting menu and it was very good. Interesting mix of flavours and textures, everything very well executed.
 The sommelier was brilliant and found us a brilliant wine in our budget.
 Service was attentive without being over-familiar.
 A really lovely night.",1
5,"Monsieur and I went to Clos Maggiore for his birthday earlier this year. It had been recommended by a friend and was number one in several categories on a restaurant website, so we gave it a whirl. The evening was an absolute dream. The waiters were warm, professional, courteous and efficient without being 'in your face'. The ambience was comfortable; an interesting blend of traditional and modern. The food, however, was what we were there for and was nothing less than divine. The scallops were seared to perfection, a pure taste of the sea, and the black-legged chicken with spaetzle and snails was unusual and so packed with taste-bud twists that my eating automatically slowed down to allow the chance to properly savour each mouthful. 
Prior to arrival, I'd e-mailed the General Manager of Clos Maggiore to warn them that we were celebrating a birthday. Completely discreet, the waiters didn't let on that this fact had been passed on until the very end of the meal, when Monsieur's dessert was presented with a lit candle and Happy Birthday written in chocolate sauce around the rim of the plate. 
Since then, we've been back once and experienced another perfect meal. We've also booked ahead for two family occasions over summer. Take it as read that this place is definitely worth the splurge. Keep an eye out for their deals, too, which are so good that you almost feel as if you're robbing the restaurateur.",1
5,Clos Maggiore epitomises the best of French cuisine.The dishes served in the restaurant are based on the Provencal style of cooking and although the menu is pricey and probably you would not eat there every night it nice to go there for a special occassion. The bonus of eating here is that they have a multi-award winning wine list accompanying the menu.,1
4,"I brought my son here
 He doesnt like french food but the food at this restaurant changed his mind.
 The salad of young Leaves with sherry vinaigrette & herbs was sensational.
 Very smartly dressed waiters.
 Will definatly go here again",1
4,"I can recommend this restaurant which is said to be the most romantic restaurant in London, and it sure is intimate and romantic. Do however remember to ask to be seated in the conservatory when booking as it is by far the best ambience wise. The food is Provencal french and superb to say the least. The wine list is equally impressive and the staff are friendlly, attentive but without being in your face.",1
4,"A true oasis in Central London! A taste of the Mediterranean in WC2. A favourite place to escape, great food and drinks.",1
4,"I took my wife to Close Maggiore on Saturday for her birthday. The restaurant really is a gem and perfect for special occasions. Sitting in the conservatory is a must, as you will regret it if you don't.
 The staff performed very well and the food was delicious. The wine list is outstanding and runs some 85 pages. The downside of that is that many of the bottles in a more affordable price range are sold out. While they do have some fantastic bottles, they run around £200. There wasn't much selection in the mid-range so the choices jumped from £50 to around £150-200. Still, they have to be commended for a great wine selection.
 The only thing that marred our experience and prevents me from giving them a full 5 stars, is that while we had an 8pm reservation, we didn't get seated until 8.30 and had to wait in the very small lobby. While the staff was friendly and kept us informed, I still expected to have a table when I reserved.
 While the food was delicious and everything did seem reasonably priced for the experience, my starter of wild scallops was a disappointment. Three scallops for £15 is pushing things a bit in my opinion.
 I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone for a special occasion or just a romantic dinner out.",1
5,"This is by far my favourite restaurant in London. The setting is incredibly romantic, the food is exquisite, the wine list impeccable. I have been here 3 or 4 times now and loved every experience. It is pretty pricey but if no more expensive than other restaurants of the same standard (and I don't think there are many of those around to be honest!) There is a private room available for hire upstairs but the conservatory area in the main dining room is where you want to be for the best ambience. I almost don't want to post this review because then you'll all go there and I want to keep it just for me!",1
2,A pleasant interior with nice dimmed lighting. My gripe is that every dish is laced with heaps of cream and butter. Why o Why can't french chefs cut back on the cow and just let the freshness of ingredients shine through? I'm tempted to give it a third star as the cepes were delicious and that New Zealand Viognier 'The Wingwalker' an exceptionally delicious white wine.,-1
3,"This french restaurant looks so warm, cosy and inviting from the outside and it doesn't disappoint. A lovely quality restaurant which is romantic and serves quality food and wine is quite a find in tourist ladden Covent Garden. The staff really look after you and the decor sets the scene for a romantic meal. Definately a place for a special occasion.",-1
5,"This was my first visit to Clos and I have no idea why it has taken so long to get there as it has quickly climbed towards the upper echelons of my Favourite Restauarant list. Relaxed and intimate, with excellent food and a truly intimidating wine list, it is an excellent special occasion restaurant for couples or small parties alike. The decor is great: we were downstairs at the back under an impressive canopy of twigs in spring blossom (not real, but the effect is excellent) and the whole effect is subtle lighting and discrete charm. Good aircon too which was essential on the balmy July evening that we visited. The food was superb with the meat dishes particularly impressive. Service is friendly, efficient and non-invasive and winos can spend hours working through the encyclopedic wine list. This isn't a cheap restaurant, but it is not outrageously priced either - the problem is that with the relaxed atmosphere it is very easy to get pulled towards all the little extras that produce a bill larger than you might have wished! It is hard to regret it though as Clos is a really satisfying place to spend an evening. Highly recommended.",1
5,"Stellar!!!  We were on our last night in London in the area visiting friends and wanted a quick bite to eat before heading back to our hotel and upon searching for nearby restaurants, this one caught my eye.   I haven't had dim sum in a very long time and my fiancée was up for it so we popped in.  
We were greeted immediately and sat promptly, there wasn't much of a wait time until our server approached us and explained the menu and took our drink order.  Drinks arrived and we ordered shortly after.  It was no more than 3 minutes that passed that the food began arriving.  It amazed me to see that many people I the restaurant receiving their food so quickly.  
We ordered 6 dishes.  Pork puffs which were packed with flavor yet light.  Prawn crackers which had a nice tangy chili dipping sauce along with it. Crispy prawn balls which had a nice crunch and another great sauce paired with it.  Next up was the firecracker chicken roll which packed some awesome heat, not too much but just right for our palates.  Traditional xiaolongbao was next and there were delicious; seasoned just right and I wish I ordered a second order.  Lastly we had one of the specials which was Crispy duck bao... oh my word!!!  This was the absolute best!  The buns were soft and fluffy, the duck had a nice crunch to the skin and seasoned perfectly and the plum sauce accentuated everything just right.
The service was exceptional and the food was amazing.  This is a must try for any dim sum fan or someone who wants to give some delicious food a go.  Cheers!!!",1
3,"The decor is nice.  The staff is okay.  We went with 3 kids 2 year olds and a 12 year old.  We requested to be seated at the bottom level and they said we couldn't be seated there as they were close to closing it was still an hour and a half before they closed.  I realized when I looked below that it was all adults seated there and the guests with kids were seated upstairs.  It's not really kid friendly as it is kid tolerated.  The food was okay, I ordered a lychee martini which was decent but they forgot to wipe the bottom of the glass which was wet so when they settled on the table it was wet as well.  Our server did his best but with one server waiting on 7 tables it was just okay.",-1
3,If you're looking for an authentic dim sum experience it won't be here. They have a mix of authentic dim sum with some fusion ones they've created... but it's hit or miss! They have chicken cashew dumplings and the chili chicken bowl to be very salty and not spicy a all. Some wins are your basic har gau dumplings and we had the soy ginger salad that was pretty good! Service was pretty good despite them being short staffed and the atmosphere is awesome. I wouldn't recommend coming here for actual dim sum but I don't see myself coming back! Not worth the price.,-1
3,"A good atmosphere with nice decoration, which attracts a lot of customers - the place is pretty much full by 7pm. 
We tries 8 dishes, to be honest, the taste is average...xiao long bao was overs-teamed and dried up inside, so are a few other dishes. The only best dish is the special dessert green tea custard bun - however green tea paste is more like green bean paste with green colouring. 
The service is often delayed here but not fault of the waiters or waitresses, this place is just understaffed!!",-1
3,"We went for dinner with a few friends and had a good time. 
The menu had a few standard dimsum plates but also, more generic Asian dishes in general. I found most of their dimsums acceptable but not the most flavourful. For instance, the soup within xiaolongbao should have been served much warmer, succulent and tasteful. Nonetheless, most everything got the job done, so I would give the place three stars. 
Service was generally good. Whilst there was a slight glitch with our reservation, they were prompt in finding us a table for six. Throughout the meal, they served most everything on time. However, the bill they calculated turned out to be wrong on many items, so we had to manually check them and get them to correct for us. 
Ambience was modern and spacious. Not your average Chinatown dimsum place and good for reasonably stylish gatherings.",-1
3,The food was good.  I recommend the spicy chicken dumpling.  It does have a kick to it.  The spinach and mushroom dumpling is good.  The firecracker chicken roll is not spicy.  The service was ok.,-1
4,"Came here after a day of shopping looking for some take away food to have for dinner in the hotel. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because many of the items on their menu they didn't actually have.  One of the items they show off on their side walk board out front of their entrance, they only serve for lunch. So we were a little disappointed. But the food was amazing nonetheless. I'm glad we didn't walk out. We ordered 2 different chicken dumplings (chicken with cashews and spicy chicken with vegetables) and both of them were so fresh and flavorful. They were surprisingly out of vegetable rice so we opted for plain sticky rice and it was good and fresh. Their chicken skewers (3) were delicious and well portioned. Lastly, since their pan fried noodles advertised outside but only served for lunch were not available, we chose a vegetable dumpling and noodle soup and it was still hot when we got to the hotel and was packed full of goodies. We were very happy with everything we ordered and hope next time we can try the items they didn't have available. It was busy the entire time we waited for our order and every wait staff we encountered were very pleasant and kind. The place had a great vibe!",1
3,"I've been to the Southbank branch a few times and always really enjoyed it, so I was excited to bring friends here. I booked a table for 3 on a Weds eve and we were given one of the solo tables rather than being along the shared bar which was great as it's much easier to talk when facing each other!
Unfortunately it all went a bit downhill from there as the service was inexcusably bad. We had around 45 minutes of happy hour left when we arrived so were pretty confident we could fit 2 drinks into that time, I ended up chasing the waitress down in order to get our second drinks ticket in on time. We also had to wait around 20 minutes for them to pick up our order sheet, despite the fact that we filled it in straight after ordering our first drinks. The biggest bug bear was after our food arrived my friend asked for a fork as she can't use chopsticks, and after at least a 10 minute wait sitting with our food going cold she had to go and ask a second waitress to be provided with one.
I've given 3* rather than 2 as the food  and drinks were good and reasonable for the price we paid. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and is buzzing, but on this occasion the service could have been a lot better.",-1
4,"I do find it amazing how rare it is to find a restaurant that offers dim sum after the 5pm cut off point. Although not your typical china town establishment, Ping Pong has obviously honed in on this little niche market and has done quite well in delivering food quality wise and has even produced dumplings which have been experimented on Heston style. We are talking art form here and everything in this restaurant is very classy, very modern, very artsy. One place you definitely need to pay a visit to are the toilets (not for that reason!!) which is situated down a dimly lit corridor (which is my excuse as I accidentally walked into a room with funny wall sinks...) and which are accessible by swiping a hand over a motion sensor panel. The decor is very upscale market and although the food is quite expensive individually, it does work out better value when opting for the set menus which offers several dishes and which does fill you up! In the event of you not being full, and wanting to try more or as much of the dishes as possible, then please do visit Sunday's special buffet, neatly labelled lazy sumdays ;-) for under a fixed price of £25 you are treated to a wide range of dishes which you can easily get carried away with. 
In terms of drinks, try the teas, as healthy as they are, it's also very fragrant and they come prepared with a 'tea bag' propped open with the tea contents shown.",1
2,"Why did they bring us all the dishes at the same time :-@ !!!!!!!!
I could never ever understand!!!!! I've never experienced such a restaurant in Japan.
Something like Dim Sum which is considered that that served warm are the best way of eating should be always served one by one. Never ever all at once.
Is this just the difference of our custom?! If so...  I should've told that when I ordered. OK I will from now on then. 
Anyway.... when it comes to the taste, (I ordered SHARING SELECTION FOR 2)
Only 'crab and prawn dumplings' and 'honeyed chili chicken&mushroom rice' were tasty. The others were ...... I wouldn't want to eat them. But I really liked this chicken rice. It was flavorful. full of Chinese soup taste.So I rated 2 stars.
Sorry again but I was sooooooo shocked that they brought them at the same time........  :-()",-1
4,"I finally lost my dimsum virginity, and it was glorious!
Ping Pong serve super tasty food in quite an opulent setting, but if my calorie tracker is anything to go by, this richness comes at a cost!
The waitress told us that most people order 3 or 4 dishes and that the majority of dishes come in sets of three - three dumplings, three crispy prawn balls, stuff like that. So the three of us eating decided to order 14 dishes and share all of them to get a good selection.
we ordered:
basil and chilli cashew nuts, seaweed crackers & salted broad beans: TASTY
3 dipping sauces: TASTY, BUT WHY ISN'T IT FREE OF CHARGE?
oyster mushrooms: COLD & STRANGE BUT STILL TASTY
crispy prawn balls: BIG, CRUMBLY BALLS OF MESSINESS
prawn toast with sesame seeds: DELICIOUS AND MEATY
beef and chilli parcels: TASTY
beef gyoza dumplings: YUM
four mushroom puff: SUBTLE FLAVOURS BUT TASTY
roast pork puff: GOOD
chicken & mushroom rice pot: DIFFICULT TO EAT WITH CHOPSTICKS
chilli pork tender loin: DELICIOUS
honey-soy chicken wings: WONDERFUL
chicken & garlic dumplings: STICKY
edamame & truffle dumplings: SOGGY BUT TASTY
To be honest, there was so much on the table it was difficult to keep track of what we were shoveling in. Everything tasted pretty good, and I recently found out they do an all-you-can-eat on sundays which I'll be sure to give a try!",1
3,"With all the great dim sum options in London, not sure how this restaurant thrives.  The dim sum overall is mediocre and the service is snotty.  If it was in Lexington, Kentucky, I could see the novelty but with the great options in Chinatown (and others) I would not return.
Went with a friend and we tried multiple dim sum.  None were bad and some were pretty good:
--  Duck bao.  One of the more disappointing.  The duck was smoked and I prefer roasted while the sauce was somewhat thin.  It was a nice sized portion, though.
--  Duck spring roll, good but not great.
--  Prawn toast with sesame seeds, one of the best options.  Tasty, a lot of prawn, not much filler.
--  Spinach and mushroom dumpling.  A surprise success, especially as I normally don't care of mushroom.  Very tasty, fried but not greasy.
--  Honey soy chicken wings.  Looked and sounded good, meaty wings, not much flavour
--  Char siu bun, a standard but well prepared and tasty, good balance of filling and bun
--  Prawn and chive dumpling, good but not great
--  Black prawn dumpling, most interesting and innovative dish, good flavor
--  crab and prawn dumpling, good but not incredible
I also didn't like the service.  Empty restaurant but they could not put us in any of the tables we wanted.  Ended up eating outside, which was great, but they were really kind of jerks about finding us a table.  Overall, a competent meal but not worth the opportunity cost.",-1
4,"We went as a group of 5 on a Thursday night to Ping Ping Soho. Our table was downstairs and although you're underground it really doesn't seem as such. You almost feel as if you're in a fish tank looking out! There's a lot of natural light for an underground floor. 
The wait staff are very polite and gave us a complimentary bottle of beer as it was a birthday in our group which was a nice touch. 
On to the food...considering dumplings aren't really a speciality dish in their native country, Ping Pong manages to make the dish very appealing both to the eye and the palate. The selection is huge - seafood, chicken, beef, pork and lots more. Our favourite was the Shanghai Xiaolongbao. It's necessary to get the dipping sauces to add extra flavour to the dimsum. 
Another top dish was the broccoli with the mustard dipping sauce. Then it's also worth trying the duck spring rolls with black sauce. 
The portion size of the seaweed and prawn crackers was slightly small however they are of a higher quality than you'd typically find at a Soho Chinese restaurant so not too big a complain there. 
Huge recommendation whether a small family group or a large gathering of friends.",1
4,"Came here for lunch with a friend whilst shopping on Oxford street. The decor and ambience in the place was lovely, and the service was great but the food was by far the best! It's easy to order from the list they give you and you just tick off what you want. The waiter was also helpful in suggesting how much to order. We order about 8 dishes (they suggest 4-5 per person) and shared them and it was exactly enough. My favourite was the prawn balls and the chilli squid! Soooooo tasty! 
I also had a glass of fresh lemonade which was really lovely and refreshing! 
I would definitely return here again!!",1
5,"Wow. First of all, I really want to talk about the service - it was exceptional, we were served by two young girls, so nice, attentive and everything was served so quickly Probably best service I had in London! 
The food deserves so many stars ! It was absolutely delicious, the beef gyoza was definitely my best choice! The drinks were beautifully served, I had a mojito - which was surprisingly big ! On top of having a 5star service and a 5star food rate they offered us free cocktails for our next visit- that's got to deserve 5 stars for sales and CRM right ?",1
3,"Umm I did enjoy the food, not overly keen on sitting at a bar with other customers to eat my food but guess this is the style of the place. There are big circular tables downstairs which are available to book for groups. There are a lot of options on the menu to choose from and a good cocktail list too.
The house white wine was very nice.
I think there could be a few more options for set deals as these were limited.",-1
1,"Worst experience - no one to greet you as entered into the restaurant. Then when someone finally arrived they told us to go to table 43 without someone actually showing us to the table so we were left to wander the restaurant looking for our table. Then after trying to call numerous waiters to get our order, no one bothered to attend to us after 30min - didn't bother to wait around to give our orders in.",-1
1,"Very bad service...
We visited with a group of friends 10 in the party.  As it was XMAS we all stuck to the set menu.  Before we could order drinks the food started arriving...  Within 10 minutes the first and second course was on our table.  Luckily by then a glass of bubbly arrived.  None of us could finish these courses before the next arrived.  Needless to say it felt like they wanted us out!  Then the long wait started...  Over 20 minutes before I could get the attention of a waiter who when I complaint said it is not her table...
In summary bad service and most of the drinks were out of stock... Skip this branch they don't care about customer service!",-1
3,"I was invited out to lunch by a friend and we decided to go to Ping Pong; I had heard about them and she had already been. I love dim sum and wasn't too disappointed; it isn't the BEST in London, but it's tasty enough, the price is right and it's served on a decent environment with good atmosphere and sleek, modern decor (typical dim sum places can be noisy, too brightly lit, uncomfortable and that cliché ""chinese takeaway joint""  decor can put one off).
You are given a menu and a list where you tick your selected dishes - quite fun and makes ordering easy. Each portion comes with around three pieces and most are under £4. The baskets come to the table all at once and will be stacked high if you order a lot; tables are on the small side, so it can become a bit awkward juggling all that stuff. But you'll manage. :) It is the right thing to do here, though; the portions aren't huge (they shouldn't be; it's dim sum after all) and it would be very time consuming to keep refilling your table everytime you finished a basket, increasing waiting times.  
If you're not too ravenous you could order two or three + a small main meal (one of the rice dishes, maybe). If you're really ravenous, well, you're going to spend a little more or go elsewhere. If you're going for the set menus they are good value, but remember you'll get mostly individual pieces instead of a portion of three as in the a la carte.
Almost everything I ordered was tasty, especially the honeyed chilli chicken and mushroom rice pot (not a big portion, but it's only over £6 so I certainly wasn't expecting a bucket). The char sui buns (steamed bun with BBQ pork) are ok; I've certainly had better, but also much worse. Loved my drink called Hibiscus Spritz; you are given a glass of fizz with a flower inside an ice cube in which you pour a concoction of liqueurs; very ""chemistry class"" and deliciously refreshing. Didn't have time for more cocktails and dessert, but will do next time - the drinks menu look particularly appealing and I really liked the one I tried.
Apparently they are always changing the menus with the seasons. A good trick to get you coming back, and I intend to. :)",-1
4,"So much foooooood. Belly soooooo full!
All you can eat Sumdays rock here at Ping Pong.
As we had arrived before 1pm, we were also able to avail of their free cocktail on their Sumday. Woo hoo. 
Everything tasted great at the start, but by the end it was difficult. Too much food ordered and I for one was not going to embarrass myself by leaving any behind. By the end the taste of the food was not the priority and the novelty had worn off. 
But still I recommend Ping Pong for their service, which was excellent. Also for their decor, which is very cool. And the food, which was great up to a point. 
Just don't make a pig of yourself and you should be grand. 
Recommended.",1
4,"I have to admit I was really surprised with ping pong.
The quality of the food was excellent, the service was quick and they were really attentive.
Price and quality I think it is really reasonable and the dumplings were absolutely ridiculous.
Dumpling and cocktail heaven :)",1
2,"Was able to get a table for 4 early on a weeknight, but they were extremely strict about the time limit. We were told to leave about 15 minutes before the end. Make sure that you book a table and maybe have plans for where to go afterwards. 
As part of London restaurant month, they had a special dim sum set menu. Everything came out relatively quickly, but the portion that came out was a little small. It was also not the best dim sum I'd ever had, but I haven't had a good one in London yet.
This place was geared towards the foreign palate as opposed to real Chinese dim sum. Depends on what you're looking for.",-1
1,They can't even make proper xiaolongbao. How dare they call themselves a dimsum place??,-1
4,"I've been to a different location a few years ago and although it was delicious-- it wasn't somewhere I would choose to go back to over and over again. I suppose I feel the same still but I was very pleasantly surprised at the value for money here! We were in the area and starving so we basically just picked the first place near us. We each got the set menu for 1 -- I got the vegetarian and my friend got the chicken I think. A rice bowl, 3 or 4 appetizers, and 4 dim sum for around £12.50 if I remember correctly! We were both shocked at how much food we got and even though service was mediocre and my wine glass came out a little dirty.. I'm not mad about it. We had a good time and the seating at the bar looking down was pretty cool. Wouldn't be opposed to coming again if I was in the area! The food was satisfying, the wine was good, and my company was great :D",1
4,"Very trendy restaurant in soho. Got very busy on a thusday night. Lots of little sharing plates. Duck sprig rolls were lovlely as was prawn toast. great price. Ate 10 dishes and 4 drinks for less than £60. Read my full review at 
georginadoes.co.uk/2015/…",1
4,"It's crazy that I'd been planning on going here for the past YEAR but I never got around to it TILL two nights ago... They kinda wanna force you into getting 4-5 plates each which I don't appreciate as I don't eat much and don't like to be told how much to eat! Damn them for that! But apart from that the food is really tasty!! The scallop and shiitake steamed dumplings are the truth!! *falls on bender knees with hands raised to the sky* and the HONEY AND SOY HLAZED WINGS!! Ohhhhhhh myyyyyyyyyyyy goshhhhhhhh .. Chicken wings just became elite with that dish! 
Would defo recommend it!!",1
4,"It's a good Chinese food place when you don't want to go into China town.
While I am Chinese and I don't mind to go into China town, sometimes if you have a business meeting, it may not be appropriate to go into the hood and have the whole authentic experience.
In fact, since I am chinese, if we go to an authentic Chinese restaurant, sometimes people feel like it's ""my territory"". Ping Pong offers this non - territorial atmosphere where you can order a lychee martini or mojitos and have it with your dim sum. It's a great hang out place for 3+ people so everyone can have a sharing + fun experience. It's a great place to take your non-chinese friends for their first dim sum experience. Fantastic!",1
5,Had a party of 10 we pretty much ordered everything and it was all good haha.  Even the asparagus was surprisingly delicious.  Good for parties =).,1
4,"Had a great time at Ping Ping on Saturday night & really enjoyed all items on the menu. My personal favorite were the Barbecue Chicken dumplings-  SO tasty. I was with a group of 5, and everyone loved their meals. I look forward to coming back here very soon!",1
2,"As far as Dim Sum goes, Ping Pong isn't bad, but especially with it's proximity to China Town taken into consideration, there really are better options for those craving Dim Sum in London.
While Ping Pong provides a good atmosphere, with a unique layout and a well-dressed an attentive staff, one soon realizes that you end up truly paying for the atmosphere as opposed to top-notch food.
While not bad by any means, the portions are small and the prices high to the point where you really are better off simply taking the walk to China Town for a more authentic experience.  
If you're absolutely desperate for some Dim Sum, Ping Pong is worth it for their unique atmosphere, but if you're looking for an authentic, filling, or cheap outing, look elsewhere.",-1
4,"All you can eat Dim Sum,
I'll give that a try.
I ate so much I thought I would die.
I tried all sorts, crispy and soft
There was lots of things served, steaming in pots.
On plates they came in parcels of joy.
All bite sized and served with Soy.
But overall I ate so much, 
My stomach distended and caused an ache in my guts.
My advice to all when deciding when beat
Stop before you have had all you can eat.",1
5,Really fun and much bigger than we expected it to be. Very cool atmosphere!,1
5,"Love the place.
It's a stylish, trendy and modern chinese restaurant, good both for couples and small groups (up to 8 people in the round table at the -1 floor).
Their specialities are dim sum: typical chinese dumplings, mostly steamed, with several different fillings.
It's a sharing restaurant: that's it, you order a few dishes and then share them with the whole table, that's why I said ""good for couples"", I don't really suggest it for a date! also because.. well dumplings are not really the food you want to have with somebody who never saw you naked: they are kind of big and you'll find yourself in that uncomfortable situation where you don't know whether it's better to eat the whole dumpling in one effort (and burn your tongue with the filling as it is damn hot), or bite the dumpling letting all the filling drop on the plate... well just don't come here for a date ok!? It's not the place!
Speaking about the food, the quality of it is really high: dim sum are great, with several different fillings and everyone with its characteristic taste and smell, delicious! strongly suggested the black ones (called black prawn dumplings), with squid ink pastry, and the chicken shu mai, chicken and asparagus in a top opened dumpling. But, just take some of them, portions are not that big (from 2 to 4 dumplings each) and it's just so good to share everything with your table!
Don't forget to have a cocktail or something to drink, this place has a lot of different options you rarely see and their presentation is always special (as example, take the hybiscus spritz: awesome!)
I still have to try the upper floor, with tables surrounding the kitchen, but I can't say anything bad about this place, this is just great! ah and it's not that expensive!",1
4,"On a recent trip to the uk, tried out this place through recommendation, can't say I'm disappointed at all! Came with empty stomach and left stuffed!",1
5,"Ping Pong is quite possibly my favourite dim sum restaurant. The service is great and there are lots of options to choose from on the menu including seasonal specials.
The cocktails are definitely worth trying but make sure you ask the waiter beforehand on what is recommended. 
The only downside is that the portions are very small for the price. You'll have to order at least 5 dishes to feel somewhat full. 
I highly recommend the prawn and scallop sticky rice, the spicy chicken dumpling and the prawn and chive dumpling! Feeling hungry now...",1
5,"Best drinks here ever! I had my favorite drink here - their signature ping pong cocktail is one of my all time favorite drinks :)
Really great dimsum! One of the best in London! Love the ambience and how hip this place is! I would definitely come back.",1
5,"After six days and ready to go for try the ping pong's all you can eat I'm writing my review. Environment and atmosphere were amazing and they bring you in an oriental place. You forget to be in London after the first bite. I forgot the dishes's name I will write down today. I can't wait to be there for breath again the same scent. Service was quick and very polite. Our waiter Vinh has been so kind, as our first time in ping pong he explained us everything about menu and dishes. Supervisor and manager were on the floor to check if was everything ok, and at all time you had chance to call someone that help you. The best ravioli and Chinese style dishes in London that I tried so far. I'll write another review about my all you can eat experience in ping pong really soon.",1
5,"Sorry, I just hands down love this place. Maybe because I'm a white guy and I don't know what ""real"" dim sum is, but this stuff is just the best. I have probably eaten here ... conservatively ... 20 times. And if you add up the other Ping Pong locations I've been to, it's easily over 30. I love it. This one has decent ambiance - better than the other ones I've been to. Here's what's good:
Har gow - can't go wrong with this classic (again, says the white guy who has no business calling anything a classic)
Steamed dumplings: spicy chicken, spicy vegetable, chicken and cashew nut oh good lord it is my absolute favorite thing there
Lemongrass Jasmine iced tea - get it everytime!
Here's what's not good: leaving this place, not eating at this place, and anyone who reviews it less than four stars. Eff you.
Lastly, everything comes really quickly. You can't go wrong here. Really! If they were franchising in the US, I would sink some cash into one. And eat myself out of business.",1
4,"As restaurant chains go Ping Pong has to be one of the better ones.  I have been to a few of them over the years and they always serve delicious tasty food.
Ping Pong Soho is no different.  When I ate here recently it was full of people happily indulging in their favourite dim sum dishes and guzzling Ping Pong's fantastically exotic cocktails.
This is a particularly good venue for big groups and looking around this time I could see that most of the tables were filled with large groups of people.  The only small issue I had this time was my group of 16 were seated on two separate tables.
The food here is really delicious.  For those of you not familiar with the concept it is mainly Dim Sum, small bite sized portions of food which are traditionally served in small steamer baskets.  They can be steamed, fried or baked.  In addition to the dim sum they also serve a number of rice dishes such as Honey-Chilli 
Chicken Rice Pot or Vegetable Sticky Fried Rice and some small plates such as Honey Glazed Spare Ribs and Chilli Squid.
For those of you a bit unsure of what to order there are set menus which will give you  a decent variety dishes to try and this is particularly good if you are ordering for groups.
If however you do fancy ordering for yourself then I can heartily recommend the aforementioned ribs, the Potato and Edamame Cakes, The Crispy Prawn Ball and to start the Garlic and Black Pepper Prawn Crackers.  Just don't go mad.  The food is a lot more filling than it looks and you can always order more later. 
The big selling point for me though has to be the cocktails.  They put a big twist on your common or garden variety cocktail.  With names like Hong Kong Colada, Wasabi and Amaretto Sour and Smoked Nashi Negroni  they are sure to be a conversation starter and the best bit is they taste as good as they sound.  For those of you not so keen on alcohol they have  a good choice of mocktails and lemonades, and for those of you who want something simpler they have a good selection of beers, ciders and wines and a huge selection of teas.
And the best bit of all is the bill at the end of the night will not break the bank!",1
4,"when i found out ping pong was a chain, i was ready to hate it, but it's actually pretty tasty! we ordered a bunch of dishes to split between three of us (probably about 8 plates) and i liked everything. we got a mix of things from buns to dumplings to edamame and it was all really good and served quickly *
in total we spent about 20 pounds each including dessert (least fave part of the meal - get dessert somewhere else), a cocktail (these were good, just don't get lychee martini unless you reeeally like lychee) and enough food to completely stuff us. i thought it was a pretty good deal. our other friends got the set meals which were 10 pounds but didn't seem like such a good deal since you can't really pick which things you get..
* the food comes out all at different times so you get all your dishes staggered. it's actually kind of better like that though, since you always have something to look forward to until the very end (and then you can look forward to dessert obviously)
** also the bill came with two cute little wooden dolls which i took and will be re-gifting to some sad ""friends"" back in america this christmas and passing off as vintage japanese dolls from the uk. thanks ping pong!!!",1
5,"Ping Pong definitely has to be one of my favourite dinner spots. 
It's a really modern, trendy, vibrant place to eat dim sum and have a few cocktails. I would definitely recommend going on a Sunday when their lazy sumday offer is on: £21.50 all you can eat (excluding a couple of areas of the menu). As ping pong is a dim sum restaurant, this offer definitely pays off, especially when in a group as you can all sample a large amount of dishes for far cheaper than you could ordinarily. 
The cocktail (though excluded from the lazy sumday offer) are absolutely delicious as are the non alcoholic drinks. I would definitely recommend the Hong Kong Colada as well as the Passionfruit lemonade.
As far as food goes the dim sum is expertly made and really delicious. If you are unsure of what to order, go for anything in the Ping Pong selection but, as I said, I would recommend going on a sunday so you can experience many different types of dumpling. 
Definitely recommend this spot for dinner/drinks in the city.",1
4,"- modern, simple interiour; not too cozy (however, most Asian restaurants are not really cozy)
- fast service, but not too friendly (very impersonal)
- table in the basement: very dark/air not that fresh (you smell of food when you leave the restaurant)
- great tea and unusual cocktails
- good quality of dishes: edamame (2.65 GBP), spring rolls, vegetable/king prawns sticky rice were both very delicious (4.15/4.55 GBP)
- great variety of dim sum: crab and prawn dumpling (3.85 GBP), black prawn dumpling (4.25 GBP), spicy chicken dumpling (3.65 GBP), etc.
Conclusion: I did not like the place/atmosphere that much, but the food was just great!",1
4,I loved this restaurant! I recently went there for my first time for Lazy Sundays - all you can eat dim sum for one base price. Everything we ordered was insanely delicious!!  My friend who is familiar/local ordered for us and it felt like he ordered one of everything! I can't even remember which dish was what because it was such a spread! The atmosphere was lovely and the service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and kept drinks and plates filled! Cannot wait to go back!,1
5,All you can eat dim sum on Sunday is a real treat! The black prawn dumplings are divine and there aren't many exclusions from the 'all you can eat' offer. The service is quick and friendly and we weren't waiting long for a table. If you like Asian food/sea food then you really should get down here.,1
4,"Quick, tasty food, which doesn't cost the earth - it's just a shame that I don't like dumplings!
After my third visit to a dim sum joint I've finally realised that I don't particularly like much of the food.  When I say much, I'm really referring to the dumplings, those steaming piles of slimy stuff delivered in towering stacks of bamboo baskets.  They're just not for me.  I really enjoyed everything else that we had, the edamame, duck rolls, honey chicken and rice.
The service was really efficient, although our waitress was either stoned or just extremely disengaged with the planet.  The beer was too expensive (£6.95 for a 640ml bottle) although this seems to have become standard at most chain restaurants these days.  If you can get a seat at the bar I'd recommend it - it looked much more comfortable and spacious up there.
4 stars overall - a chain place like this can never really get 5 stars so to get 4 is doing very well indeed.",1
2,"They used to have more vegetarian/vegan dumpling options on the a la carte menu. While they offer more on the vegetarian combination meal, they do not offer most of them on the regular menu).",-1
3,"After viewing the menu online I was extremely excited about our planned dining experience. The menu has so much variety. I met a group of friends at the restaurant, great location, just a short walk from Oxford Circus underground station & perfect for a group of girls. The service was spot on, the staff were friendly and welcoming, the restaurant has a great feel to it with gorgeous interior decorating and warm lighting. After viewing the menu for a second time I was so excited about ordering food. We decided to go with the set menu, extremely cheap for central London and looked amazing. I think we paid £15 for a 3 servings including dumplings. When the food came out it looked great but was cold and unfortunately not all that tasty. Rice dishes weren't fresh, dumplings slightly over done. I would give this restaurant a second shot but I wouldn't go for the set menu. They also have gluten free options available which is great!!",-1
1,My first and last visit. I was hoping to taste some interesting and good dim sum. But instead we got soggy overcooked stuff. Ginger lemonade or iced tea (not sure what was it) wasn't good as well. Service was really slow but the restaurant was not busy at all. Staff was just walking around like there were on holidays. We have specifically ordered one menu because of one dish which they didn't have. Which would not be a big problem if someone would actually tell us that they don't have it. Almost received bill before last dish arrived which we had to ask for! And of course our bill didn't reflect the food and service. I am really surprised that this place is still open.,-1
5,"Not your traditional dim sum! All the classic dishes are on the menu - but with little twists, like using fragrant jasmine rice instead of glutinuous sticky rice, and prawn toast using french garlic baguette instead of normal toast.
 The menu is extensive and all the food, especially the seafood ones, were bursting with flavour and extremely fresh. You must try some of their more unusual dumplings - the seabass dumpling is a delight to the eyes, with a dunpling skin dyed purple using red cabbage juice.
 What sets Ping Pong apart from other dim sum restaurants in London is that its not a boring and stiff place - there's a lounge area, and their cocktail menu is quite extensive. You would go to Royal China for example if you had a business meal or a proper Sunday brunch with family. But you go to Ping Pong for a fun night out with friends.
 Pricewise, its more expensive than your usual dim sum in Chinatown, and probably the same price as other great dim sum places like Pearl Liang and Royal China.

3,"I like the ambience at Ping Pongs. We went as a group of around 20 from work and had a huge number of dishes. They have round tables which is always a  good idea if you are going as a group. 
The ordering style is new as well..As mentioned by some of the other reviewers, they give you a small list of the dishes from which you tick off what you want. Surprisingly this list isn't taken by the waiter, instead they write down the order anyway... 
Unfortunately, I am a big fan of an un-dim-sum-like dish here- the honey pork ribs.",-1
5,Worth the wait. Try the squid ink dumping. As good as dim sum gets without the carts which is actually better since i never know wth is the items they push around in the carts. With the menu it easier to figure out what you want to eat and order. They are popular for cocktails but I found them to be on the sweet side - yes I have more then a few.,1

dim sum is just OK,. The other dishes are mediocre.
The drinks are pretty good.
The waitstaff are attentive.",-1
5,I love this place. It's all about the duck spring rolls!!! The dim sum is also very good and would recommend getting their set menus which is great value for money.,1
3,"I have to say, I've been to this PingPong and the one in Hampstead for at least 7 or 8 times and I keep on coming back...yet still I only give this place a three-star rating - why is that?
Well, the dim sum is actually pretty decent here, the selection is definitely very innovative and the food quality is always very high. In fact, I often come here with a Chinese friend who agrees with all of the above.
So, what is it that I don't like? Well, it comes down to the interior design and the customer service, which this place is kind of lacking. Inter-design-wise, I am sure that lots of people would disagree with me, but for me this is too slick, too stylish and too wanna-be funky. As for the customer service, the people here seem to be lacking a great deal of motivation - no smile, no sign of personal acknowledgement whatsoever...and this just doesn't go well with me.
Plus, it's also not a cheap meal, unless you come on a Sunday, when you can do Lazy Sum Day, which is an all-you-can-eat-kind-of-deal for GBP 18.99...still not cheap though.
What this place is lacking is the authentic Chinese experience of push cards being rolled around in the restaurant, the steam baskets piling up in the trolleys and also the fact that you can order in a more leisurely style. Along the lines of: I still could eat one more, let's see what the next lady is having in her trolley...
Well, if you want this experience in London, I suggest you go to New World in Chinatown...",-1
3,"I heard great reviews of Ping Pong from Londoners before visiting myself.
I think this place is pleasing because of the atmosphere.  There was special effort put into creating a modern ambiance for enjoying dim sum.  Regardless, I thought the food fell short.  
I ordered the vegetarian special menu.  It's a great value because I was extremely full for only about 12-13 pounds.  However, I wasn't in love with any of the 6-7 items I received.  Everything seemed to lack flavor or have an oddly mushy exterior.  Nothing tasted bad, but it there were no moments of culinary interest.  Also, things felt a little too commercialized with the open demonstration of pulling pre-made items out of a fridge and plopping them on the steamer.  Efficient, yes.  Appealing to showcase, no.
I think this place is great for a social gathering, where the focus is more on the company and less on the food.",-1
1,Dim sum did not impress me this time at all. Very disgusting tasting. I have had ping pong a few times before but in other locations. I usually to the sum-days deal of the 21.95 all you can eat as eating there on a regular day is a rip off. After this experience of poor service and horrible food I will not be going back. Embarrassing how I took a friend and she hated it too. It's the worst to have to shell out good money for food you hate you just leave feeling ripped off and £30 each poorer as cocktails are a good £7 per cocktail. Never again ping pong.,-1
4,"Nice venue, quite chic setting but waiting staff were overrun, it was busy and there only seemed to be a couple of them. Very friendly though. The dim sum was delicious, and the cocktails were good too. Apparently the staff don't get all of the tips (management takes a cut), so we took that off the bill and left cash instead! That way it goes to the waiter. Overall it was good, we had booked a special Chinese New Year menu online for £16 per person which was good value - otherwise I'd say it might be a bit pricy for the portion sizes. Definitely book ahead, otherwise it was a 30-45 min wait on a Wednesday n",1
3,"Always enjoyable. BUT, prices are steep for what you get and the dim sum is merely acceptable. The stuff they serve in China Town is far superior. I do like Ping Pong's cocktails though and often go just to sample them before moving on to dinner elsewhere.",-1
4,"Keep in mind that I have never had dim sum before- only korean dumplings which are a lot different. I am such a fan of Ping Pong. I love how clean and chic the dining experience is. I went with two friends and we ordered about 9 different things. Each one being better than the next. 
I will say that I wasn't full even after spending an exceptional amount of money, but it was so tasty. Maybe I'll try some other dim sum places and see how they compare to Ping Pong, but for now this place is great!",1
1,"Yawn.  From the food to the service, Ping Pong is a bore and I'm shocked that it has received 3.5 start from my fellow Yelpers.  
My hubby and I had to flag down a server to place our order and actually had to ask for our drinks to be delivered (they had been sitting on the bar counter for close to 5 minutes) after our horribly bland food arrived.  Sure, the decor is cool, but the only saving grace for their food is the spicy chili sauce that actually provided our bland dim sum a bit of flavor.  Ping Pong is overpriced and lacks in flavor...head to Chinatown for real dim sum.",-1
3,"I enjoyed the food here and it was certainly an interesting dining experience (you get a little menu at the start and you just mark what you want from it and hand it in, it also comes very quickly) but nothing to rave about really and think you can get better Dim Sum at Yauatcha quite nearby!
However I really enjoyed the coconut and mushroom soup, the vegetable puffs and also the duck spring rolls!",-1
5,"We totes stumbled into Ping Pong on Great Marlborough Street by accident really. We were trying to ditch the impending rain and fill our slightly soured hangover bellies when we waltzed in. 
Little did my friends and I realise we had arrived for ""Lazy Sumdays"", possibly the best invention ever! On Sundays and on weekdays in most of the City locations, Ping Pong has an all you can eat special for just over £18 a head.  If you've never had dim sum, which many in my party had not, and you are superhero hungry then this is the deal for you! Most of the menu is available for this deal but the only trick is everyone in your party has to order this deal.  This was not a problem for my friends.
We basically ordered at least one of everything on the menu and if we came across anything we didn't like (which was rare) we simply moved on to the next thing.  We could barely waddle our fat rumps out of the door by the end. It definitely sorted our hangovers out and sent us off as lil happy dumplings.
Sign-up for the loyalty card for more deals and make sure you get one of their yummy cocktails or one of their beautiful gourmet teas.",1
5,"PingPong, I love you. Three years after I lived in London, I still dream about you. I clutch your postcards and weep. I stalk you on Facebook - with each status update, my stomach drops. 
Why?! Why?! WHY won't you open in Chicago?! 
In all seriousness, though, PingPong was my favorite place to eat when I lived around the corner. I still crave it and I'm convinced you really should open a location in Chicago.",1
3,"Ping pong is a definite must. 
The atmosphere and feel is just great, as is the food. 
Must have's: 
Chicken puff 
Chicken and peanut 
Spicey chicken 
Crab claw 
Anything with prawns 
Ask for some dipping sauce. They really compliment the dim sum. 
Menu does change, so beware it may not all be on there. 
Selection of wine and beer is good. Their cocktails are heavenly! 
The reason I have given it a 3 and not higher is because of the consistently poor service and the over pricing.  Food is def a 4.5, if not a 5.  The service and prices is minimal.",-1
3,"I suppose, in a way, it's good that Ping Pong is spreading the gospel of dim sum across London. The choice of dishes extends enough to sate western palates and the ambiance is mass market chic
The 'service' is generally good but they do drop the 'ball' with the odd dish but I suppose this is because they're aiming to 'serve' a more mainstream market or for people who are new to dim sum. The best 'table' is probably at the counter where you can watch them steaming and preparing the dishes.
A safe bet but not the most 'smash'ing for dim sum.",-1
5,"I love this place. It's Genius! Making a meal out of a bunch of appetisers allows you to sample a bunch of different things rather than picking one dinner choice. With 3 portions per appetiser, it is perfect for ordering a bunch and sharing. 
My don't miss recommendations are the wonton soup, duck spring rolls, spicy chicken dumplings and fish and pepper gridled dumplings! Also great prices on wine by the glass and excellent cocktail; 
The service and atmosphere at this location is spot on. Very friendly staff and a great vibe going on. Perfect for a meal with a friend or an interesting convo starter for a date.",1
4,"I dragged my sister to this Ping Pong venue to break her dim sum virginity. Thankfully, it didn't disappoint.
 Yummy little plates of dim sum, friendly service and great cocktails made for a successful evening. It's not cheap, so it's probably best to go for the set menu that Sarah mentioned below.
 If you're new to dim sum, I'd really recommend Ping Pong for serving something for all tastes. They've often got great specials on too, so you can try something new on most visits.",1
3,"Came here with some friends on a Thursday evening. Very busy with lots of late night shoppers from Oxford Street and the surrounding area. I think I counted three other guys in there, everyone else seemed to be twenty or thirty-something groups of women (can't say that I was complaining!) 
I'm not a big fan of chains and prefer to support indie restaurants when possible, but sometimes when you're out with people you just want quick and easy 'safe' options. 
Ping Pong is a very safe choice. Everything is fine at this branch. 
Drinks are ok. Good taste, but weak measures + too much ice) 
Dim sum is ok, but a bit bland and pricy for what it is. 
Service is good, lots of staff, typical of this sort of high-end mainstream type of restaurant (think Strada, Bertorelli etc.) 
Same goes for the surroundings, clean, well designed, with moody colours and lighting, but a bit soulless. 
All in all, if you want a safe option, very close to Oxford Street tube, you could do a lot worse than Ping Pong. It's close to a 4 star rating, but expect to feel a bit rushed if they're very busy and they also don't accept American Express, which is pretty poor considering the number of restaurants in their chain + their enormous margins.",-1
5,"Big fan of this place.  The upstairs bar is great if you are waiting for the rest of your party to arrive.  Food is tasty and the drinks are outstanding.  This place is great for groups too.
I recommend the maodou - soybeans with celery salt.. yum, spicy pork fillets and satay chicken spring roll.  Drinks: I would highly recommend the lemongrass and lime cocktail.",1
3,"I am not sure why I don't love Ping Pong. I mean, I should. I love food, and will generally and happily eat most things that are put in front of me. And then ask for more. My friends all love Ping Pong, and suggest stopping by whenever we pass the ubiquitous Ping, but after a couple of visits there I am not so sure. So what is my issue?
Well, perhaps I'm not sure how I feel about dim sum? I mean, it is a little odd. It comes steaming to the table, and then by the time you have got your chopsticks out, the dumplings have turned cold and gone strangely sticky. 
The other thing is the cost. On paper it seems inexpensive. £2.99 - £3.99 for three dumplings. But here is the thing; the dumplings are swallowed in a flash, and they recommend ordering at least three portions, so it starts to slowly add up, then there are all the little sides, then the bill is bigger than expected, and I am still hungry!",-1
2,"MAYBE its because we got this delivered?! Everyone is entitled a bad day right?
After hearing so much about this place, I was more than excited to experience London's little dumplings, was super ecstatic, but.....boy was I let down.
Their menu was impressive, so many selections and options for vegetarians - so I went crazy and ordered just about one of everything. 
When the food arrived, it arrived in cute little packaging, so ""yay"" for packaging...but once the food arrived in my mouth, it was not a party.
Okay, they weren't absolutely terrible, but a couple of the dumplings I had didn't belong in my mouth. 
I ordered: 
green chive dumplings
coriander dumplings
seafood dumpling
crunchy golden vegetable dumpling
fluffy white vegetable buns
fresh veges in the sticky rice lotus leaf
and a couple other things that I can't remember....
I remember spitting out some of the dumplings and the foods wrapped in leaves. The buns weren't nice, kinda dry and tasteless. 
I don't know about this though, its hard not to get dumplings right, next time I'm in town, I'm definitely going back - they must've just had a bad day of cooking, because it wasn't only me who didn't have a pleasant experience. 
Ping Pong, you're just so cool, I hope my next experience here is a better one. I promise not to get it delivered! 
My first experience here was....DIM.",-1
4,"There are a couple of these restaurants around town now, and they are all good.  I was first introduced to Dim Sum by my sister and have now become a huge fan.  I love to get the little slips of paper and tick off the ones I want.  In the past I have often come here while I was starving and probably got a bit carried away as I ordered way to many.  
I often team my meals here with a pretty jasmine tea to watch the flower open before my eyes.  They also serve some good cocktails making it a popular destinations for groups of rowdy girls.  I find it best to venture here at lunch since it is less busy, but both are good.",1
4,The dim sum was great and I felt comfortable dining there alone.  Highly recommend for the business traveler.,1
3,"I went to the one in St.Katherines Docks just before Christmas, and considering I'm not a massive fan of Dim Sum I was pretty impressed.
 The food was full of flavour, which I was pretty surprised to discover because I normally find Dim Sum not up to much in the tantalising the tastebud department.
 Oh and I must also mention the pretty Jasmine tea, where the flower opens up as it soaks up the hot water.
 Very nice.",-1
5,"Ping Pong is a new chinese restaurant chain in the city and I am quite sure that in few months everyone will know about it!
 There is a wide range of choice in terms of dishes and cocktails! The food is very traditional (I had never have something like that before) and worth more than its price.
 The place is getting more and more known by people, I highly recommend you to book.

4,"Ping Pong dim sum, London's latest all day dim sum haunt. We're great fans of Yauatcha - Alan Yau's (creator of Wagamama) fantastic all day dim sum place and we'd heard that Ping Pong was just as good but cheaper.
 Well was it?
 Certainly on entering it looked great. We were taken downstairs and there were a number of huge round tables with a subdued light in the centre. We sat on one of the squarer tables but this had a great view of huge ornamental Japanese style courtyard, with trendy projections playing against and enormous wall.
 The food and cocktails were certainly cheaper than Yauatcha (not that Yauatcha's expensive) the cocktails were only six or seven pounds each, which was terrific value as they were very long, full of fresh fruit like kumquats, lychees, blueberries and grapes. Mine in particular had tons of fresh mint and was very alcoholic - so much so I managed to knock a third of it over - D'OH!
 We chose about ten dim sum dishes between the three of us and they averaged at about £3 each. Ping Pong provided a handy menu that we could tick to keep track of our order and make it simpler to give our order to the waiter.
 Onto the food. If I hadn't already been to Yauatcha's several times, I would have thought the food was brilliant. It was certainly very, very good. Some dishes such as the chive dumplings stood out. The sticky rice in parcels was also tasty. The puffy buns were light and filling at the same time. The chilli sauce that was served with most dishes blew my head off - so handle with care.
 My friend had an amazing jasmine tea to finish - boiling water poured onto the head of jasmine flower. It looked like something out of Alien as it grew tendrils in the heat and eventually a white flower wound its way through the water looking like a sea anenome.
 Like all of the new dim sum places in London the toilets were highly trendy too. Black granite everywhere and sensitive taps which turn on as if by magic.",1
3,"I agree with another reviewer that this is a great restaurant for socializing, but the food can go either way.  I arrived as part of a group of five, and we sat downstairs around a (too large) round table with benches.  It was a work-meeting at lunchtime, so non-alcoholic, and I had a delicious lemongrass-flavored iced tea. The waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, but the ordering and delivery of food was confusing, in part because it is all small dishes, and in a group it was difficult to figure out how much to order and sharing some of the dishes proved awkward.  Some of the deep fried stuff was great, but some of the others - meh.  Also, the bill escalated quickly, as all these little dishes add up very quickly.  I would suggest this as a place to go with one or two others who like to share, but it was not great for a larger group.",-1
4,"On your first visit or if taking a ping pong virgin you have to have the jasmine tea. It isn't that great tasting but is a visual delight.
 I pretty much always love pingpong. Had a dull moment a while back when I ordered something which turned out to be a pudding by accident so along with everything else out came some deep fried loveliness with ice cream.
 I've never found anything bad just wish the portions were a little more generous. The lazy sumday is a bit of a challenge as you have to eat loads to make it good value.",1
4,"Have been to a few different Ping Pongs. The food is lovely and straightforward to order.
I was disappointed on this trip that they staff weren't terribly attentive. They didn't come back when my glass was empty to see if I would like another, or when the food was gone we waited a long time for attention when we were asked if we wanted dessert not if we would like to order any more dishes which came as a surprise to me. They had the potential to get more money out of us!
So, no extra drinks and no extra dishes....we went for dessert at Starbucks with a cheescake and coffee...pity Ping Pong missed out this time as on other occassions we have enjoyed our dinner there.",1
3,"First time I went I loved it.  And the second too.  After that the novelty wears off and you start to notice the Dim Sum is not the best nor the cheapest.
But every time I take someone new they love it, especially if they haven't had Dim Sum before, so we end up going back.
Really good cocktails and atmosphere.  Try the cumquat mojito and the chinese tea with the flower in it that grows while you watch.  Great for groups.  Part of a chain there are a few around.",-1
5,"Ping Pong is my ideal place for dim sum. It is where Western standards meet Eastern foods and the jasmine flower balls are a pretty entertaining gimmick first time round. I'm not really a fan of gristle or fat on meat, which you can tend to get in a lot of Chinese restaurants.But Ping Pong is polished dim sum, there is no poor quality meat to be had here.
My usual list of things to order are: Traditional sticky rice parcels, the jasmine tea (with the ball!), chicken puff, har gau, spicy chicken and vegetable dumplings and char sui buns. This is usually enough for two people and me and my friend always eat them in a particular order as well.
I like the dark decor as well, its very masculine and the seating is generally good. Though beware the curved tables at the back in this outlet, as although they have a great view are rather cramped when the food comes. Ask if you can sit downstairs if possible, it's equally as nice. There are couple of these around town, but I would say that this one has the best location and the best seating despite it not being the largest.",1
4,"I ate at this place about three years ago now and it had, hands down, the best dumplings I've ever had. I kind of fantasize about those dumplings. There were so many!
 It also has a fresh atmosphere and some seriously amazing ice cream.",1
4,"Not at all unlike eating dim sum in a nightclub. It's nothing authentic, but a fairly swish operation, with decent quality ingredients and drinks abound.
 The ordering process is more than a little bewildering, and though the waiting staff do offer to help out with choosing and so on (a la Wahaca), I got the feeling they wouldn't put themselves out too much. Pah, maybe they're just busy.
 We had cocktails to start off with, which possibly wasn't the smartest move, but we had to wait for a table. They were worth it though, unusual and very well made. However it meant that tastebuds were somewhat dulled when we were seated and the tea came along. The teas are great and quite well sum up the whole experience - far from authentic but snazzy. The flowering teas open up when they are poured. Nice touch.
 Anyway, back to the food. Ordering is done by ticking boxes on your own lottery-esque ticket. Pretty standard stuff on display. In addition to a large array of dumplings, we tried a few pork buns, soft shelled crab and a chef special chilli prawn concoction. All the food was tasty, yes. Didn't set my world alight, but it was tasty, arrived quickly and made me happy.
 Ping Pong do a Dim Sumday on Sundays, eat all you can / like for £17. It's not a bad deal for Ping Pong, as it's not a cheap place to go on a regular day, but the formula works. Fresh, quick, accessible. People leave happy.",1
1,"Disclaimer: I grew up in East Asia, so my expectations may differ from the average Londoner when it comes to Chinese food.
 I've only eaten in Ping Pong once (the City branch), and that was more than enough. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing that this restaurant has going for it is the ambience. The portions were small and the food was bland at best. Definitely not up to the standard of restaurants found in Chinatown even the not-as-nicely-decorated ones. The dishes were rather pricey too.
 While I did not try the drinks here, I'm told by an alcohol-loving friend that this place has some incredible cocktails.",-1
4,"Great idea: dim sum, jasmine tea with pop up flower, cocktails, and contemporary and clean feel. A mini-chain now.
 Try the sticky rice served in a leaf.",1
3,Dim Sum is tasty and the cocktails are Fab. I went with a group of people the service was o.k.a little pricey so typical for Soho,-1
2,"I love dim sum. Love it. Tasty pockets of deliciousness (think I just ripped off Ping Pong's slogan there) what's not to like? Well, Ping Pong's baked 'Pork Puff' that's what's not to like. This was the first dish to arrive to our table and it was essentially a mini sausage roll that someone had poured honey onto. Sickly sweet and unpleasant, it did not fill me with high hopes about the rest of the meal.
Fortunately, this was as bad as it got and although the Soft Shell Crab was greasy, all three of the steamed dim sum we chose were delicious. The service was very quick and efficient but I resented the waitress encouraging us to over order. Three to four dim sum each seemed a bit over the top and these dishes weren't cheap. In fact, being a big fan of dim sum I noticed that these prices were at least a pound more than anything you would pay in China town. Ok, you get to sit in sleek surroundings and sip cocktails but frankly I prefer my dim sum with a little more character and would rather sit in some weird Chinese back room restaurant than have another watery 'Lychee and roses' cocktail for £6!",-1
3,"Dim sums in every shape and flavor is a way to describe Ping Pong. There are lots of Ping Pong's in different areas in London, therefore a safe option to find one in your part of town.
In my opinion this place is perfect for visitors who like to put little bits and bobs together. The choice is extensive and for those who have a hard time making up their mind, there are set menus.
You get a pencil to tick the right menu box for the dim sum chosen. Ping Pong recommends 4-6 dishes each, which mean a table for two will be covered by all sorts of dim sum baskets in every shape and form. 'Surprise' is the right word to describe the dumplings you choose, as you do not know what it tastes like before you have tried each of them.
I little tip, ask the waiters to not bring everything at once - it is a shame when food gets cold. The place is an experience, it not only holds surprises for you but also engages with the customer interactively. You will not get bored and you need to be skilled in eating the dim sum with chopsticks.",-1
4,"Ping Pong is a perfect place to share a dinner with friends in a trendy and modern atmosphere.
 There are 12 place Ping Pong all around London, so choose the nearest and enjoy the moment. You can also choose to go to this awesome place to drink good coktails.",1
4,"When they say good things come in small packages, they were certainly referring to these delicious dim sum bites!
If there is any place in this world i  would spend £2.50 for 4 mouth fulls..it would be this place! hands down,no questions asked!! 
Meat eater or veg, they can accompany for both with equal rights seriously how many times have you gone to a place for a meal and you look at the menu and the veg to non-veg dishes ratio are like 1:10...anyone else have that problem?! But fear not this place shant disappoint on that front.
The food is healthy so no need to feel guilty for indulging. You would think with such portion it would take you at least 10 dishes to become satisfied but i was proved wrong! and believe you me this is the only time I am greatful to be proved wrong. I ordered 3 dishes and was relatively stuffed and that saying alot because I love food and I can eat!!
The drinks are rather extraordinary from the colours and the taste. This is one place were both alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks are enjoyed in the same matter. They are vibrant, thirst clenching and unique...
The setting are modern and abstract, the ambiance is relaxed,warm and welcoming. This place is perfect for birthdays, drinks after work, lunch, dinner, social get together, dates, and to simply indulge.
need i say more run to your closest one.",1
5,"I love going to pingpong. The service is always brilliant and the food... the hoi sin vegetable puff with a honey glaze really is to die for! they also sell some unique cocktails and teas. I recommend the Kumquat Mojito. Brilliant for sharing, that means you can order a larger variety from the menu!!",1
4,"I love the place.I eat at the one close to Carnaby Street and the food was amazing! Ok..I did not pick up the bill so maybe thats why I find the price ok
 I had a special cinnamon cocktail that was fab ( I had 3 )!!! The service was a bit on the slow side to make the first order, but after that all wa smooth!",1
4,"When I am out drinking in Oxford Circus, after a few beers my friends and I often head to Ping Pong .Basically this is what this place is good for, a quick, light bite. Love the decor and love the fact that its easy. Yes I could walk to Chinatown for Dim Sum, but why waste drinking time! Also, I like to eat in stylish environments and this place looks great.I really like the pork puff, but could be too sweet for some people Oh and GREAT cocktails!",1
3,"Been to this Ping Pong many times. Good spot for groups (with enough notice). Excellent and creative drinks. Decent food, but nothing very special. The usual ""asian fusion"" kind of fare that seems so commonplace these days. I go back just for the fun drinks :)",-1
1,"We went to this restaurant as a group of about 15 for my friend's birthday.
 Upon arrival I went to the bar and asked that I seperately order two bottles of expensive champagne and pay for them now in cash so as to keep them off the main bill. I wanted this to be a nice surprise for the birthday girl. They looked at me in a total state of confusion as to why I would want to do this. I eventually paid up and returned to the table.
 The champagne took 20 mins in getting to us, meanwhile I was trying to put everyone off ordering drinks so as not to spoil the surprise.
 The drinks eventually arrived and we ordered the food. The waitress was rude and uninterested. It took ages for her to take our ordering slip which we had promptly filled out. We each expected to make 2 or 3 rounds of orders but in the end it took 2 and a half hours for them to serve us just 2 dishes each, we gave up and I asked that the cake be bought out. Someone said they would deal with it. A few minutes later the rude waitress returned and asked loudly right infront of the birthday girl ""should I bring the cake out now?"" it was meant to have been a surprise.
 20 mins later and the cake hadn't arrived, I asked her again, but still no cake arrived. Eventually I asked the manager who said he would deal with it which he did. However, as soon as 10 members of our party (including the birthday girl) left for a cigarette, he bought out the cake... To an empty table!!
 Eventually we complained and only paid a fraction of the bill. But this wasn't the point. It took 3 hours from start to finish and we received very little food. It totally ruined the evening and we were all still so hungry that we ended up getting noodles on the way home.
 If I could, I would only give one star. Thoroughly disappointed, will never visit again.
 Also, food that DID arrive was average.",-1
4,"Aside from the wait, the experience was wonderful. The selections were great and presented beautifully. The food was great, and the interior design and atmosphere was a lot of fun.",1
2,"The food is... ok. But it always feels like you're paying as much for the decor as the food, and the whole place is trying a bit too hard to tell you how cool and urban and happening you are. There are half a dozen places around the corner in Chinatown you could go to for better food (Top of the Town, maybe) - just ask for the dim sum menu and point at random.",-1
4,"Where I come from something like ping pong would be amazing, but in London it arguably is nothing special. I nevertheless love to go there for a quick lunch (it's so close to the Soho office). And I don't really mind that they trade true authenticity and top quality for style and price. As long as they serve dim sum the way they do I'll come back.",1
4,Tried the Oxford Circus PingPong for the 'DimSum'day lunch last Sunday. Cocktails do live up to their billing and the apple cinnamon one was incredible. Despite the pork puff tasting suspiciously like a Greggs steak-bake it was all delicous. The staff were friendly and the atmosphere very nice. I am sure that there are cheaper/tastier places to get Dim Sum but Ping Pong is really great for a lovely lunch or drinks.,1
4,"Love Ping Pong. I am a big fan of dim dum and when I found out London has a place that serves inexpensive Asian fare, I jumped on it. I've been a fan ever since. This place is always packed and for good reason. They serve top quality food. Like other places I frequent, I tend to order the same thing over and over. And here's what arrives; chive dumpling, corriander, dumpling, char sui bun, duck spring roll, and prawn toast all washed down with a beer or two. This is a fantastic place though at times the service is lacking.",1
4,"We always choose this place for dinner when we want to have girls night out with my friends. The place has a clubby vibe and can get very busy and noisy during the weekends, but it is still cool and relaxed. I suppose you could call the restaurant a bit trendy but it is not too pricey and service is friendly.
The food is served in small dishes so it is fun to share and try out different sorts. Pick up Dim Sums in any flavor you like, combine with  sticky rise and veggies, and for drink I would recommend the jasmin flower green tea( so beautiful). But if you don't feel like having tea all night, also the drinks are fantastic. 
The location is so central that after the dinner it is easy just head to the night life in Soho!",1
3,"Whilst lovely, Ping Pong is starting to get a tad formulaic. It still hits the spot, with a fine selection of Dim Sum . . . . but, well . . . . it fails to light fires in the way that I would want or in the way that say, Yautcha can. Granted, Yautcha is in a different league price wise and dim-sum there are freshly made to order. But Ping Pong's cut-price ready-meal formula is starting to wear thin.",-1
4,"Pretty good Dim Sum, although probably not as authentic as you can get in China Town, (so long as you know where to go), no bookings unless large group. Stylish decor, good drinks menu. You can sit at at bar and watch food being prepared, or sit on stills around the atrium and there are tables from 2-12 people. Service can be erratic when busy, which it usually is. Reasonably priced.",1
5,"Just delicious, from the har gau to he jasmine bulb tea, just totally delicious all of it. cool modern atmosphere, reasonably quick service but not fast food quick, nice place to chill and chat with mates and great great food especially on Sundays when they have an all you can eat for 17 note, and i have taken advantage of that several times. The one in hampstead is also very good and usually less busy.",1
5,One of my favourite restaurants in London! It has a great atmosphere. Sit and enjoy a cocktail while you wait for your table. Very good service and food to die for!!,1
4,"Great place to eat tasty, reasonably-priced Dim Sum in the centre of London.
 Although we ate around 6.30 on a Saturday evening, the three of us got a nice table
 downstairs no problem and despite being busy the food was timely and the staff were
 friendly.
 The interior is quite trendy but not imposing. Three of us ordered cocktails and none of us
 were disapointed, not bad for around 6 quid a drink.
 The food itself was very tasty and nicely presented. The steamed spicy prawn balls were
 particularly nice.
 Nice restaurant to take friends and unwind after a hectic shop on Oxford Street.",1
4,"Great place for Dim Sum.. funky interior, big round tables ideal for groups and reasonable priced. Yummy!",1
3,"Luckily I managed to get to Ping Pong in time to avoid queuing, though having to wait at the bar for a table allowed us to enjoy one of their delicious freshly made cocktails which really were very tasty.
 Not knowing what to expect we went for a set menu (Dumpling Fix) which gave us chance to try several of their dishes for much better value than selecting individually, which would work out fairly expensive as most of them are around £3 each compared with the £11.50 we paid for 8 dim sums as well as duck spring rolls and pork puffs, and a mango pudding.
 It was the first time that I had tried dim sum, and I'm not sure it's really for me, though I certainly did not leave feeling hungry with dish after dish being brought to us.
 Definately worth a visit, even simply to determine whether you're a fan of dim sum or not.",-1
3,nice selection of dimsums and buns in modern building. it gives better taste i guess.,-1
3,"Was the first dim sum place I ever went to so it has a special place in my heart, but i've found that the genuine chinese-run places are a cut above. Still, the food is good and tasty, and the cocktails are stunning for the price (especially the ones with lychee juice in them). Try out the sunday all you can eat menu - it'll fill you up in no time!",-1
5,"Ping Pong has got to be one of my fabvourite easy-dine restaurants, and not just because I'm a massive fan of dim sum. The whole style of communal eating is condusive to a fun and social night, and their cocktails are adventurous and tasty. Best going without a budget, as the tasty dimsum treats are best ordered without holding back. Look out for the 'Chef's Specials' too as they often offer a new take on tradtional dim sum treat.",1
4,"Note to oneselfmust do another Ping Pong Lazy Sumday!
 Went here on the recommendation of a friend. I'd never experienced dim sum before, and subsequently now find myself drooling at the prospect of another of Ping Pong's fine char sui bunsOh dear it seems I'm hooked! 
Baked chicken puffs, seafood or chive dumplings, Jasmine chicken spring rolls and crispy prawn balls headline the growing list of favourites. Not to mention the beautiful flowering Jasmine teas.
 Portions are served in pieces of 3 - perfect if you visit with a couple of friends and take a culinary tour of the unlimited Sunday menu. Arrive in a small party, and you may find yourself sharing a table downstairs - as is the norm, but here is where the similarities to some of China-Town's old-school haunts end.
 The decor is all chocolate modernism with a minimalist kick. Even a visit to the loo is all theatre here!
 My one gripe then - and this has yet to spoil the day - is that the friendly staff are only somewhat attentive, being as at some point during service we felt forgotten - on both visits.
 That said, we will be returning for what feels like a lot of luxury for only a little bit of dosh in a truly lovely setting.
 Little steamed parcels of deliciousness indeed!",1
2,"Went to Ping Pong for dim sum with a couple of friends a few weeks ago, and I find their dim sum selection is as good as those offered in China Town. The prices are slightly more expensive than China Town, and the quality is about the same. I am not hugely impressed by the quality of food. However, on the positive side, you will be eating in a nicely decorated (contemporary) environment. Recommended if going with some friends whom you are trying to impress.",-1
4,Good Restaurant uppu!!!!!!!!! We went a group of friends to this Restaurant on occasion of my birthday. My friends all suggested me to go for this restaurant. After we came here we are very much pleased with food and service. I am really very Happy to celebrate my birthday in this restaurant. Next year also i would like to celebrate my birthday here only. I would suggest my other friends also to come here.,1
4,Good restaurant for groups of friends to gather together for a fun meal and a change of scene. If your new to the place order a set meal for a choice of different steamed dim sum the best choice for newbies would be 'Sum it all up' a very tasty set meal of about £12 and order an extra side of either steamed buns or bbq ribs if you feel for a top up. Very cool atmosphere and quick service. Will go again and again. Although you can pick up a steamed bun in china town for £1.,1
3,"Decided to give this place a try last night and was really impressed. Inexpensive, good atmosphere, and polite staff. Highly recommend the spinach and prawn wrap.",-1
3,"it's a bit like the tardis,looks tiny from the outside , but goes on forever and has a big downstairs.. the atmosphere is good, I'd only say that if you haven't been before i didn't know what to order. so probably ended up with the blandest thing on the menunext time i'll go with someone who knows what there ordering, the drinks alcoholic or not are great good.long tall refreshing  and the toliets are a talking point.",-1
5,"hey i had late lunch here last saturday with a good friend of mine and i really have to say it was just perfect! the little parcel were so nicely arranged and awesome yummy. the cocktail freshly made with best juices were übergreat. the only thing the could enhance would be the chocolate buns, european chocolate is so much better ;-)",1
5,"Mercury may be the Roman God of poetry, but Le Mercury is poetry in motion and London's God of value. Off the beaten path, yet worth the hike, take the Victoria Line to Highbury and Islington, turn right out of the station and walk 10 minutes to TravelValue heaven ... HOOAH!
Arriving 30 minutes before our reservation, thanks to an extremely efficient Tube journey, we were greeted warmly and seated at a table in the dark, romantic room surrounded by tables with white linen tablecloths each with a large candle on top. We started with bottles of Ochagavia (Chile - £16.95), an oaky, scrumptious cabernet sauvignon, and Hildon sparkling water (750 ml - £2.50).
The service impeccable, all starters are just £4.45 ($6.15) and all main courses £10.95 ($15.15 - except the steak which was £12.95 - $18), a bargain for the quality and flavor. My wife ordered the Chèvre Chaud Grilled Goats' Cheese starter with a salad garnish and basil pesto sauce and I had the Moules Marinière (mussels) in a white wine and cream sauce with ""shallots, garlic, lemon and parsley"". The goat cheese tart was tastefully presented as well as being light, yet savory, and flavorful. My mussels were plentiful for the price, but there was little sauce and what was there was a tad bland with nary a hint of the shallots, garlic or parsley as noted in the description. Still, they were flavorful and a good value.
For our main courses, my better half had the Asperges et Cheddar Tart, small cheddar tarts topped with asparagus spears in a balsamic reduction and a sliced avocado garnish in between the two. She did not care for the dish, as I thought might be the case, because of the balsamic vinegar which she is not a great fan of to begin with. I gave her half of my Entrecôte ă l'échalotte (grilled rib eye steak - £12.95), served in a lovely shallot and red wine sauce, along with some of my chips (fries for you Yanks - £1.95) in return her second tart. I thought that the tart was quite delicious, but I am quite fond of balsamic and the avocado garnish was a nice, complimentary addition.
I was stuffed, so no dessert for me, but my ""sweet""-loving wife  (she is ""sweet"" and ""loving too) had to have her favorite, Crème Brûlée (£3.45), which was a bit on the small side, but scrummy nonetheless. 
At £63.42 ($87.90), including a 10% service charge, we ate like kings and queens, appropriately enough. A comparable meal would have easily set us back $110-$125 in the States. The sole ""Bomb"" deduction is due to the not-so-flavorful sauce the mussels came in and the damp slice of bread that came in our first basket, which they apologized for and quickly replaced.
CombatCritic Gives Le Mercury 9 Bombs Out Of 10 ... More Bombs Are Better!",1
3,"A meal here is always great value for money.  It's cheap and cheerful and for  French food, you will be hard pressed to find such prices anywhere else. Le Mercury is a great stand-by when you want a decent meal for a decent price. 
The food will not wow you. Everything is a little under-seasoned and underwhelming.  And it's a super busy restaurant so don't expect a quiet intimate meal. Although the waitstaff are attentive, there is a sense that they are trying to turn tables.",-1
4,"Thought I'd save my 400th review for one of my favourite date nights out recently. This place has a cosy warm vibe like it could be somebody's house with all the potted plants dotted around. We'd booked ahead (recommended!) so they'd saved us perhaps the best table in the far corner, meaning we got to enjoy our own little cocoon while looking out onto the street (and making eyes at each other ;), instead of facing inwards and looking at all the other tables.
The food was quite basic but well executed, and the service smiley and efficient. The main calling card though is the price tag, with a flat price for all starters (£4ish), another for all mains (£10ish) and another for all desserts (£3ish). I haven't seen that strategy anywhere else in London, and I think it probably makes people end up spending more!
I had the starter of grilled goat's cheese and leafy salad which was a very generous size, and the sea-bass fillet main with crushed new potatoes and mint pesto which was simple and tasty. The dark choc tart dessert was a bit meh. Cocktails are limited but the wine selection a bit wider (we made use of both).
So Michelin-starred cooking it is most certainly not, but for the romance of French food while saving the pennies I would definitely recommend!",1
4,"Food is delicious, service is good, bathroom is clean.
We tried salad, soup, lamb and duck. For the lunch price 10.95 pound, the portion for both meat dishes were really good. The meat was tender and they broiled the skin somehow so it was a little crispy and fat (just right).  Bread came with the lunches. To have French lunch in London with the modest pricing, you got to love it.
Too bad they don't make French Onion soup, otherwise the lunch will be just perfect!
Enjoy!!",1
5,"We've always loved Le Mercury for its food and value. Located basically in heart of the hipster suburb is a plus with quite some street shops around.
Not exactly easy to get to but it's just around corner from both Angel and Highbury Islington is always a plus!
First of all, I must say this place is just great value! Where else can you get a proper 3 course French meal for £18-22?! No where! And they are generous portion, full of flavour as well!
Food is just great here, been to both duxumie and this a number of times and never disappoint! Top notch quality, great variety!
I do find their cocktail menu a little lacking but I'm not a big drinker so won't complain!
Certainly recommend a try, whether it is a fine dine with the love one or a nice evening with some friends!",1
2,"You get what you pay for. If you have low expectations or came really drunk, you will find this place reasonable or even good. This is not a place to bring your romantic date. 
Food was below average, my friend's fish dish came uncooked and sauce was a mess. My steak was not medium rare, and the shallot sauce was very questionable. 
I was fooled by good Yelp reviews and how busy the place was (and maybe also for candles on the table)... Wish I followed my intuition after I saw cheap paper table cloth, paper napkins and that crazy, badly designed cocktail menu on the table. I had to take it away from me because it was literally burning my eyes and ruining my appetite. 
The only thing I was happy about was the service. The server was friendly and that was about it.",-1
4,"""A beautiful story""...? 
It has been quite a while since I visited this well known Islington French bistro. I read some reviews that made me uncomfortable but decided to go anyway. 
le Mecury is a well known Islington Upper Street establishment. I moved to the area in 2007 and have dined here with friends on many occasions. The restaurant was always busy so after a few years they opened another on Upper Street. 
The novelty of Le Mercury was that all the starters, mains and dessert were for a set price for their category. In 2007 the price was £3.45 for a starter and the portion was on the lower side of generous. Now the price has gone up by £1 and the portions are smaller. However this is inflation for you. After all Islington property prices have skyrocketed in that time. 
The food in general is good. My terrine was with spicy beetroot relish was nothing novel but tasted good. The salmon with new potatoes was well made. The salmon skin was fried perfectly and was crunchy while the fish was succulent. The creme brule was creamy with a hard sugar coating, as expected, and tasted excellent though maybe a bit smaller than I remembered. My wife also enjoyed her dishes of ravioli for starter, this apparently is the plural and should be raviolo as there was just one piece, and mushroom risotto. However the sticky toffee pudding was not very sticky, maybe best not to have English dishes at a French bistro :-)
The service by the waitress was excellent. Yale, originally from Paris, was attentive and was happy to hear my mumblings about living in the area... Hence the title to my review ""a beautiful story"" which is to quote her. Of course there was no question in Yale's comment but I found it amusing that she used that phrase to describe my uninteresting story. The manager could possibly learn a bit more about a friendly demeanour from her. 
Is Le Mecury special? It used to be a different place to go in upper Street that was very affordable. Now however it is competing with alot of newer and exotic establishments. The paint and food might be a bit too tired for the younger professionals moving to the area. However I see no reason to disparage this still quaint establishments which is well worth a visit.",1
4,"STARTERS @ £4.45 / MAINS @ £10.95 / DESSERTS@ £3.45. Exceptional value for good casual French food!!!  
Went for ""Soup of the day""""Ravioli""""Beef Carpaccio""from starters twice and ""Duck breast""from mains once.I don't really remember the first time. 
But I was disappointed this time. They brought them quickly.But all dishes were served not hot.a bit cold. They must have left them sitting there for a bit even though they were ready to be served. Or did they prepare them beforehand?I wouldn't want to believe that.
It was Monday evening. Not busy, only 70% full.How could it happen?
Other than that, it was all good! The taste was nice and the portion was good with the amazing price.
I would come again and want to see if they are served cold or not.
But I wouldn't want to take a risk so perhaps ask them to serve while the food is hot .....",1
4,Quaint little neighborhood spot. Very reasonable prices for London. All starters are £5 and entrees are just £11. They have three floors so lots of room. The Ravioli de la Mer was excellent although you only get one Ravioli so don't expect to fill up on it. The sauce on the Ravioli was to die for. We soaked it all up with the generous bread basket. Entrees were Sea Bass (allegedly) that looked nothing like any Sea Bass I have ever eaten. It honestly looked and tasted like trout. That is what kept me from giving a five star review. My companion had the duck which was exquisite! Cooked perfectly and tender and juicy with crispy skin. Just as you would expect from a high end restaurant. I would definitely come here again.,1
4,"Wow wow wow. This place in my opinion is perfect. The food is amazing. I had the steamed mussels to start, duck as the main, and sticky toffy pudding for dessert! Everything was outstanding. The atmosphere is also very nice--kinda like a nice cafe style vibe. On one hand, it's elegant with candle lit tables and on the other it's not too pretentious. 
My only complaint is that the service felt a bit rushed. The restaurant wasn't too full and after some deliberating we decided it was because the service was poorly organized. Both waiters/waitresses were very attentive, but since they didnt seem to have control over one area and both worked the whole floor it meant that we got asked twice about everything and didnt get much breathing space. For example, we asked to have some more time to look at the menu, but someone was there asking for our orders two minutes later. This was my only complaint and the reason why they only received four stars.
However, overall it was a very good experience at a great price and I wouldnt hesitate to come back!",1
2,"MEH. This place is so average, it's painful. 
It's basic white girl average. 
It's white converse average. 
It's ripped on the knees jeans average. 
And I DETEST, above anything, spending money on average food. Give me a four figure Heston bill with no fear, but dont you come at me with your room temperature white and ultra fatty pork and claim it to be French cuisine. Aint nobody got time for that. 
And I wont even begin with the service. Im a nice human, seriously, and I hate calling people out on their shit work, but this establishment is famous for underpaying their staff and it shows! THEY ARE TIRED. and grumpy. and so unhelpful. and there were so many people, and it was stuffy and gross... 
ugh. Nope, not a fan.",-1
4,"Heard heaps of good things about this restaurant, and when my friends and I tried it tonight, it doesn't disappoint! Great food, great service, great ambience, and pretty reasonably priced.
The only down side was that they placed us at a bad spot even though there were many other free tables in better spots.",1
5,Best food in London! Okay maybe French kitchen wise but it's super good. Nicely priced. Perfect for date night! Also good wines and cocktails. The goat cheese and duck that I had were super! I would definitely go back. Try to make a reservation because it's always busy.,1
3,"A really cute and cosy French restaurant! The food was fair - and the price was reasonable. However, the service was excellent, and there was a great atmosphere in there...which is why I would probably go back and give the food another chance. And also to order something with the garlic potato puree! I totally had food envy when I tried some that my boyfriend had...it was to die for.
Actually...it's worth visiting just for the garlic potato puree!",-1
4,"Different and a very simple menu...in a good way. 
I adore that there is no electric lights...just candle. Perfect for a date ;-) 
Their menu is meant to be to French, though I would actually think it's more French meets Italian. 
Their prices are very reasonable. and their wait staff have a great talent of coming in, serving you and then leaving you to it. 
I would recommend Le Mercury for date as a primary! Also for a small good group of friends that was a cozy nice place to have a great meal for a great price. 
I wouldn't go here for big groups or business meetings.",1
5,The food was absolutely amazing. I couldn't fault anything.  The ambience was more romantic as opposed to going out with a friend but we enjoyed it all the same.,1
2,"Nice service, but poor quality food.
Had calamari and ravioli to start.  Then canceled entree order because the food was a major bummer.
Calamari:  VERY rubbery (way beyond the natural chewy texture of squid we all love) and devoid of flavor.
Ravioli:  Watery sauce, tough pasta and overall diluted flavor.
Don't half step.  This place is obviously quite popular and was VERY busy when we were there....so don't let my review dissuade you from trying this place out.",-1
4,"I can't believe how affordable this place is. For a nice restaurant in a somewhat trendy part of town, most of their mains are under 10 pounds. I came here last week to catch up with a friend and was very impressed. The candlelit atmosphere is dim and intimate with very cool decor. 
My friend and I decided to split a starter, Ravioli de la Mer, which was a lovely crayfish and lobster ravioli. It's perfect for one person, but since we split it we basically got a bite each. I decided to order the Magret de Canard (duck breast), which was really good. I loved the garlic mash that came with it! My friend ordered the Selle d'Agneau au Romarin (lamb), which was also fantastic! For dessert, we each got our own. I went with the mascarpone cheesecake and he went with the creme brulee. They weren't amazing, but still good nonetheless. 
I'd say it's the perfect date spot without having the break the bank. Great atmosphere and most importantly, great food!",1
5,"Cheap, French food? Is there such a thing?
Yes, there is.
After going to around 7 or 8 SportDirect stores all over London (my brother really wants this particular track jacket), I was exhausted, but it seemed a bit too late for dinner -- 10 pm on a Tuesday. However, I was hungry, and after shopping for the entire day, I really did not have many pounds left. Le Mercury was highly rated on Yelp, and it was still open (I called), so I made my decision. Let me tell you: best decision of that day.
For one, they were able to accommodate me. Granted, I was coming in on central London, and I had called around 9 pm to see if there was any availability for one. Once I was there, I easily got a seat. The host and the hostess recognized my voice on the phone (damn my American accent) and were incredibly hospitable. I've eaten at Michelin starred restaurants, but the service I received was just the same -- at fraction of the menu prices.
They have a set menu that you can find on the website, so I knew I was going to have the duck, but they also had specials which were written on the chalkboard above the bar. Everything seemed delicious. I listened to their recommendations, which was the seafood ravioli, which I gobbled up in a matter of seconds (I told you I was hungry). I was blown away at the fast service, and I guess the waitress knew the look on my face as she said, ""we tend to be fast here"". Maybe it was the fact that it was 10 pm, and I missed the rush hour for dinner, but once again, service was top notch.
Because I ate every bite of both my meals, I was completely stuffed and could not order dessert. However, I will be back and perhaps give myself a little bit more room for more. Amazing restaurant for the quality of service and food at an incredible price. You can't go anywhere else.",1
3,"Really cool spot on Upper St. Loved the food but our waitress seemed a bit out of it at times. We also found a blond hair in our calamari but it was quickly replaced.
I want to give this place 4 stars but based on the two items above, I can't justify it. We  will have to dine here again and try some of their other dishes so I can update this review. Overall though the food was solid!",-1
5,"One of my all time fav restaurants in London. Fabulous food and fantastic prices. Every time I have been the food has been of top quality. It is a great spot for groups or for a romantic meal for two. My favourites are the goats cheese to start and the lamb or duck for main. They have a great desert and cocktail menu too. 
This place is definitely worth a visit you won't regret it.",1
3,"I enjoyed visiting Le Mercury, the food was good and reasonably priced and the atmosphere was great. We were a party of 22 and they were able to accommodate us. The service was very good, if a little slow when it came to billing us which then meant the Manager tried to kick us out, saying we were delaying his restaurant when we were all attempting to pay and had been trying to for a good 15 minutes. 
I would probably come back here again, just not in such a large party.",-1
4,"Eating at Le Mercury was a bittersweet experience for me. The bitter part was the occasion - I attended a UYE here to say goodbye to one of my good London Yelp friends, Bea B who is moving abroad
The sweet part was dining here. Le Mercury is one of Bea's favourite London restaurants and with 65 reviews already, it must be one of London's most Yelped businesses at this time. These Yelpers, including some of my trusted Yelp friends with good palates, had graded it with a solid 4 stars, so I was looking forward to eating here
A perusal of the menu revealed a bistro style line up of French classics. Arriving at the restaurant, I found a setting and ambiance to match that relaxed bistro menu though perhaps, this stepped on the wrong side of shabby in the men's toilets which were in need of some refurbishment
We didn't have snooty French waiting staff to complete the French atmosphere but our waiter was efficient if not exactly warm. Le Mercury has a nice pricing plan with all starters costing £3.95, main courses costing £8.45 and desserts costing £2.95. which are very decent prices for this part of London
The food arrived remarkably quicky but the speed didn't mean sacrificing elegant presentation or suffering inaccurately cooked food. My roast Barbary duck breast had perfectly rendered crispy skin and moist meat, well complemented by garlic mash and Savoy cabbage with red wine jus. Asking round the table, there were murmurs of approval for rib eye steak and salmon though one of the steaks was a little under cooked.
For desserts, I had a rich and decadent chocolate tart and the poached pear was so good that it was half demolished before I could get a photo of it.
If Le Mercury was in France, we'd be nodding our heads sagely and admiring how it was produce well-priced and flavoursome food. So, to summarise, I'm nodding my head sagely and saying,""Bravo, Le Mercury!""
And lastly, we'll miss you, Bea!!",1
4,"Solid 3.75 stars. Food decent, value superb. 
Quick mention they didn't have our reservations down, however on an early Sunday (largely empty) they had no problem seating us right away. 
Menu is full of reasonably priced options. We did have to think a bit. Ended up with beef carpaccio (ehh) and poached pear blue cheese and roasted walnut salad (delicious) for appetizers. For the main course we did duck breast (cooked to medium rare with nicely crisped skin, fairly tasty however could have been a little more tender) and chicken breast (was decent though a tad dry). We enjoyed this with the house Chardonnay (middle of the road). 
Quick note although the menu says they charge £1 for extra bread, they provided seconds free of charge. 
Apple tart tartine with creme fraiche (perfect finish to a very solid dinner). I enjoyed a glass of cognac and left with a smile. 
Would go back again. The ravioli (lobster and crawfish) seemed popular and looked good from a distance). Might ask for a window table if available and plan ahead for fri/sat reservations.",1
1,"i recently discovered how poorly the staff is treated in this restaurant and since then, I am determined not to come ever again.
Surely the core staff members are perfectly happy working there, but there is also a lot of turnover: 
young recruits are paid under the minimum wage, and tips distribution is utterly scandalous! It can go from zero per shift, to a shocking £20 after covering a couple of months!
How can you enjoy sustaining such an embarrassing system?
Should we remind them this is London, one of the most expensive city in the world, where rent and food should not be impossible to afford for young professionals? Come on, Mercury, make an effort on this! You can do better!
A HUGE disappointment because overall, I really enjoyed having dinner there.",-1
4,"Le Mercury is a great neighborhood French bistro restaurant offering exceptional value for high quality food. For two people we ordered: 
1. 1 glass of Pernod- the always enjoyable French terrace drink (that probably no French folks anywhere near my age drink)
2. Mussels starter- white wine and garlic sauce that we dipped the bread in as well. This is one of the most flavorful mussels dishes we have eaten this year and at less than £6 the best value. 
3. Duck breast main- cooked a tad more medium than rare, however sauce was rich and good for winter. Potatoes soaked it up well. Also they switched out cabbage for grilled courgette which was nice. 
4. Salad and seafood ravioli as a main (normally a starter)- baby girl got this. Very rich with high quality seafood stuffed inside. 
5. Glass of dessert wine- Chilean. Went exceptionally well with the cheese platter. We are actively seeking out this sweet treat to have at home. 
6. Cheese platter- they graciously switched out blue for more of the others. The others were Brie and Gruyere, the Brie served with perfectly sweet biscuits and the Gruyere with grapes. 
Bees was a little disappointing as it wasn't French baguette. Overall very happy wit this place. A cozy warm bistro atmosphere of friendly people who were very accommodating. Oh yea and a £35 bill for a lot of food and drinks for two people. C'est la vie.",1
4,"We ate on a winter evening, and this place was dark; I had to use a torch to read the menu!  There was a relaxed atmosphere up on the top floor and the service was really friendly, so we were happy to be there.
For starters, I had calamari, delicious.  Main course was steak frites, no complaints whatsoever!  Dessert, a banoffi pie.  A reasonable size, and a third delicious out of three.  We had house red wine and it was surprisingly good.  I'd almost give this place five stars for a cheap and good French dinner.",1
5,"Incredible food at a very reasonable price. I went this week and had the grilled goat cheese to start; it was a creamy, smoky and a flavorful beginning to the meal. For my main course I enjoyed the roasted duck breast. It was cooked to perfection and melted in the mouth. I finished the evening with creme Brule, which was, per usual, a delicate and tasty dessert. 
On top of the excellent food the atmosphere of Le Mercury is very well thought out. The candle lit tables are lovely and the decor on the walls is playful, yet also chic. This place is perfect for a date, birthday or anniversary dinner.",1
5,"Just superb I had the lobster and crayfish ravioli and it was flavourful and rich. The sauce was tasty not too fishy but had a rich creamy taste and the contents of ravioli were cooked to perfection. My girlfriend chèvre chaud. Goats cheese on a bit of bread with a green salad dressing. Everything on that plate complimented each other and tasted sublime! 
For main I had the entrecôte cooked medium rare. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had so rich and meaty but cooked to perfection. It was served with au jus and a side of french fries. It was a simple dish but tasted amazing. 
 My girlfriend had the corn fed chicken everything on that was great from the gravy to the beans. 
Desert well you guessed it, that was amazing as well. I had the poached pear with vanilla ice cream. Just great. Flavoured with cinnamon and cloves the pear was glazed with a crispy sugar shell. It was a light way to end the meal. My lady had creme brûlée. It was pretty standard. We both agreed my desert was the best. 
The wine was great I had the Shiraz and my girlfriend had the Pinot Grigio. Also the espresso Martini was a great way to finish the meal. If you've read this far the. Thanks! 
All in all it was a great night. Very well priced for the food you were served and the atmosphere was typically french. A great french style meal in the heart of London that won't break the bank.",1
4,"I've been meaning to review this place for ages, as it's a regular haunt of mine.
There's multiple floors so you can usually get a table if you book ahead despite the constant demand. What I love about this place is the consistency in quality, and the lack of artificial light (candles only after a certain time) so it makes for a really cosy atmosphere. 
My worst meal here was a Christmas group meal with friends. I hadn't realised the set menu would be quite so bland, and the toast which accompanied my pate was cold... 
Still, I will definitely continue coming here for meals with my boyfriend, or catch-up dinners with friends.",1
3,"Don't  be fooled by the size of the downstairs room- the restaurant runs across several floors and has a lot of space. I came here as part of a party of 10, and we fit in very easily. The restaurant itself is nothing special to look at, but candle lit and simply done out. We each had a three course meal with drinks (wine), which came to only £26 a head, which is very reasonable. The food was served promptly and no-one had any complaints. My steak was cooked rare to order and was really good. The starter was OK - a bit basic, but others' looked really good.
Service was friendly and on the whole food and drinks were very good for the price.",-1
1,"After seeing their excellent rating on Yelp, I was excited to go to Le Mercury to celebrate my husband and my 1st year wedding anniversary.
Unfortunately, our experience was less than mediocre.
First of all, I had made a reservation using their online website and when we arrived they claimed that they had no record of it.  They managed to find us a table, but it was perhaps the worst table in the restaurant.  We were upstairs in a corner where the windows were completely blocked by plants.  Not very conducive to a romantic evening...
The only plus side to Le Mercury is that it is very affordable.  But the food is cheap for a reason.
We started with the ravioli, which was ""meh.""  Then I had the duck, which was the better of the two entrees and my hubby had the rib-eyed steak, which was vastly overdone. All of it was only lukewarm by the time it arrived at our table.
The service was terrible and slow.  I don't know if they resented having an extra table, but they never refilled our water and only bothered to check on us when they were dropping off our food.
Suffice it to say, though I live only a few blocks way, we will not be back.",-1
5,"This place was such a find on Upper Street! Very cheap (mains for 10 pounds), and food was great. I got a duck breast that was the size of a steak and perfectly seasoned. It was a cool ambience and very busy for a Wednesday night. We booked for 3 and our table would have been a little bit cramped for a party of 3, but luckily only 2 of us could make it so it was fine. And we had a great Shiraz, wine was also very reasonably priced and altogether makes it a great value for Islington.",1
4,"My friend and I decided to eat here one day and I am glad we did! Every main dish was relatively cheap for French food which was just great because the quality was amazing! I ordered the duck and the skin was absolutely delicious and crunchy. Underneath, the mash was perfectly creamy. I always recommend people to eat at Le Mercury if they are around Islington. Beautiful setting, wonderful food!",1
4,"I had heard many things about this place. Indeed, we got great food, at relatively cheap prices. 
Service was remarkably fast, although at some points they forgot to bring things we had asked for, like our jug of tap water.
Although it's a great location and the room is very spacious and nice, seating is not really comfortable.
The food is great though, the meat is perfectly cooked and the fries are among the best I've had in London.
Wow !",1
4,A great little French restaurant in Islington. Food good as is the service. I'm due for another visit I think!,1
4,Good food and wine. Cheap prices. Will definitely come back again. Also the ravioli starter was amazing,1
5,"Absolutely adore this place. Stopped in for a late lunch one afternoon and was blown away by the attentive service and delicious food. I had a duck dish with mashed potatoes and greens and a red wine reduction. I also had a glass of red wine on the recommendation of the waiter (though, he knew less about the wines than I did, which was less impressive). 
The food was fantastic and very reasonably priced, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was lovely. Very classy, but not snooty at all. I look forward to trying the new location down the road.",1
5,"One of my best meals in London.  
Mussels were fabulous and they are the meal that I now compare all mussels to.  
Service was helpful but not too quick paced that I felt rushed.
Nice glass of sparkling wine.
Easy location from public transit.
Highly recommend and will definitely visit on our next visit!",1
5,"A new favorite of mine. The prices are surprisingly reasonable. Starters are all under £4 and mains are all between £8-10, and they are really well done! I love this place so much that I have been back twice in the past week... don't judge me... The service is excellent as well. 
For starter I enjoyed the grilled goat cheese served on a pesto salad and it was perfectly done. Other people in my group seemed to really like their lobster ravioli starters. My husband chose the calamari but it was a little under done for my taste, not crispy at all so I would probably skip that one in the future. 
For mains my favorite so far is the Salmon served over sauteed spinach with a lobster cream sauce. Delicious! Other popular menu items among my group were the duck, the grilled swordfish, and the pork belly. All in all this was a fantastic meal at a great price. Perfection!",1
3,"Swift service (mind you we were only the second table to be occupied so at that stage there were far more staff than customers), keen prices and good food (my Barbary duck main course was very tasty but the pate starter could have done with a third triangle of toast. Nothing but praise for the chocolate tart dessert) made for a pleasant meal.
Despite the above I'm only awarding 3 stars as I can't comment on the quality of the alcohol on offer and once we were ready for the bill we'd become invisible so actually paying up an leaving took longer than it should have.",-1
4,"Everyone who goes to Le Mercury loves it. 
You can't go wrong- brilliant value, for well cooked food and super friendly, attentive staff. Its like the blueprint for a successful restaurant! 
We went one Monday night with friends. We had a cocktail at John Salt beforehand (2 for 1 until 8pm!) and then headed to Le Mercury. We had an upstairs table and service was great-attentive, but not over the top. We all had three courses (huge treat on Monday) but portion size means you don't feel too full. 
Between us we tried the moules, ravioli, carpaccio and calamari for starters. The calamari was a little disappointing, but all the other starters were excellent. They all cost £3.95, so pretty amazing value. All mains are £8.95. I had the duck which was served on a bed of garlic mash and with some cabbage. If I had one quibble it would be that the duck was slightly over-cooked, but I understand not everyone likes pink in the middle duck. The garlic mash was amazing- I would've been happy with a bowl of that and a spoon! Other people had the lamb, seabass and rib of beef all were well cooked, and the fries the boys ordered were yummy. 
For desert I had creme brulee. Not bad for £2.95, but the topping could've been slightly thicker. Others had the cheese platter, the rich chocolate tart and the cheesecake. All plates were practically licked clean. 
We shared two bottles of a decent cab sav and the bill came a few pounds over £100, pretty incredible value! The food here will never blow your socks off, but it's a dependable neighbourhood bistro and we'll continue to come here regularly. Until next time Le Mercury....",1
4,"I was pleasantly surprised at Le Mercury. We decided to go someplace for dinner before a friend's birthday party and we just ended up here. It's advertised as a French restaurant, but there's a bit of other stuff as well. Unless you get a special, the starters are all £3.95, the mains £8.95 and desserts are £2.95. 
So given the price, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. However, my lobster and crab ravioli was really nice (although the sauce could have had a bit more flavor), the duck was tasty (although it was more medium well than medium rare) and the cheese dessert (for £2.95) was three massive slices of brie, gruyere and blue. 
While the food wasn't perfect, it was cheap and it was tasty, so that's a bonus. They also had a fairly interesting wine list, and the wine we chose was really tasty and went great with the duck. Finish it off with a glass of port and it was one of the cheaper meals we've had in quite awhile.
So if you're on the lookout for cheap and tasty food, head here. We didn't have a reservation, and showed up at 6:15, and they told us they'd seat us if we could finish in an hour. Which we did. So they're willing to squeeze you in as well. (I imagine it's one reason they can keep prices so low, a huge turnover).",1
4,"Really good simple french food, every dish that came out was really tasty and hit the spot. The special slow cooked beef was superb!",1
5,"Not a lot of places you can get a really nice, romantic 3-course meal for around £15. 
Very authentic French food, great atmosphere and great service. 
All tables are lit by candle light. 
What more could you want??",1
3,"A solid and well priced French restaurant, it's been on Upper Street for 30+ years for a reason - because it serves decent food at a great price.
The crayfish and lobster ravioli is very nice, as are most of the starters. I've had the steak and chips and lamb for main and have been happy, never blown away. 
You get more than what you pay for here. We also checked out the new one, Mercury Deuxieme the other week and it was good too.",-1
2,"I was excited to try out Le Mercury after all the glowing reviews on Yelp.  Maybe we caught them on a bad day - rainy Saturday for lunch - but there was nothing particularly memorable or good about this place other than the reasonable prices (£5 starters, £10 mains, and a cheap wine list)
The service was really, really bad.  I think our server's vision was based on movement since the only way he ever dropped by our table was after desperate waving by one or more of us -- take our order, water, wine order #1, wine order #2, dessert order, check (twice).  We were exhausted by the end.
The food was unremarkable, and not particularly French (just because the menu says  ""croquette de poisson"" doesn't make fishcakes french.)  Two of us had the over-cooked swordfish over a bed of cold string beans.  A friend ordered a salad that we all agreed looked like the one you get in coach on a British Airlines flight.  The crayfish and lobster ravioli (also, ravioli... not french) starter was good but I suspect they bought them frozen from somewhere.  I had the chicken entree which was ok.
The most entertaining part was the STEEP decent down slippery metal stairs to the toilet.  As a bonus the water was running in the dirty sink and couldn't be turned off.
One star experience overall, but I'm giving them two stars because it was cheap.  You get what you pay for.",-1
5,"The food is delicious, the service is great, the ambiance is wonderful, and the prices are reasonable. What more could you ask for? 
I've been here three times and I've gotten the Mussels in white wine every time (obviously, I'm a fan). I've had bites of my friends' Crayfish and Lobster Ravioli and Beef Carpaccio, and both were very good as well. 
For the main course, the first time I went I had the pork belly, which I must admit was a little dry. But I won't hold it against them because the next two times I got the duck, which was delicious. I always get the french fries as a side and it is a good size to share for two. 
For two starters, two mains, a side, a dessert, and a bottle of wine, you're looking at about £50 for two, which is a good deal for the area and a total dining experience.",1
4,The Restaurant is great ! I went to Valentine's day (20£ per person all include). It was Very Goooooood. The staff is very nice and One person have spoken french ! (Quand même !). Thanks Mercury,1
4,"They were so kind to let us in a hour before closing. The prices were very reasonable. The ambiance was quite romantic even though I was just there with my best friend haha. It's ok. I fell for their duck confit. Perfectly cooked. I was so happy to have a very good first meal in the UK. I also had their beef option but it is nothing that I would recommend. Overall, I recommend Le Mercury.",1
5,"Le Mercury is a cosy French restaurant on a corner of Upper St and I love pretty much everything about it. My first favourite thing about Le Mercury is the food. The menu isn't huge but everything that's on it is done very well and pretty cheap for saying how yummy it is. All starters and sides are around £3, mains are £8 and all desserts are £4. Recommend the duck, if you have the chance. 
 Unfortunately they stopped doing the dark chocolate truffle cake with Baileys ice cream. The second best thing about Le Mercury is the general cosiness of the restaurant. It's quite plain but not austere, and though it's lovely in summer I've always preferred it on a cold evening. It's one of those few restaurants thats perfect for a date or meeting lots of friends.
The atmosphere is cosy-a bit dark though. Make sure to book in advance.
Best French restaurant in Islington.",1
4,"Fantastic, simple French faire.
Stopped by on a whim for dinner last night (thanks, yelp!) and we were not disappointed! I had the braised beef -it says it only comes with spinach, but there was a portion of garlic smashed potatoes underneath, if you order this comfort food dish and you're wondering whether or not to order frites too. 
We also ordered a bottle of the Rioja- it was a perfect compliment to the beef. 
The rates are spot on and the mood lit atmosphere makes for a lovely date spot!",1
3,"Food was exquisite, very reasonably priced. Customer service was top notch. Great evening overall.",-1
4,"This has to be one of the best value deals you can find in London. 
Three of us went there the other night and we were really pleasantly surprised. The restaurant feels like one of this small french bistros you would find in Paris. It is quite crowded and the tables are pretty small. All this helps with the ambience. 
The food was very good. They offer a selection of french classics with pretty much all the starters, mains and desserts have one fixed price. In the end we ended up with having a three course dinner with two bottles of wine and we paid under £ 100 for three diners. Amazing value.",1
4,"A delicious neighborhood find (and I do mean the 140a version, not the one down the street). Our chicken, fish, and pasta entrees were wonderful, wine was affordable and well-selected. I will say we found the staff a little awkward and were expecting more from a baked camembert appetiser (it was simply a block of camembert... baked. Without pastry, without a jam of sorts, etc. so it was more like an odd fondue), but I'll be back for sure.",1
5,"I'm no expert on French cuisine, but I am an expert on knowing a damn good restaurant when I run into one. Le Mercury is the total package: the price, the atmosphere, and of course the food. 
Eating out in London is expensive, too expensive... so I really appreciate Le Mercury that much more. All starters: £3.95. All main courses: £8.45 + side salad or fries or veggies for only £1.95. 
I ordered: Selle d/Agneau au Romarin (Roast saddle of lamb with grilled courgettes & rosemary jus). Boneless lamb, no fat, medium rare and cooked to perfection. I have to say that I judge a restaurant by how well they cook their lamb because most of the times it's too dry or too gamy. Le Mercury's lamb was perfectly seasoned, no chewy rubber band like parts, just the right amount of meat to sauce balance, I was 100% satisfied. My friend ordered: Boulettes de pomme de terre (Sauteed potato dumplings with baby artichokes, parmesan foam and wild rocket salad). I only had one bite (because I was too busy eating my lamb) but it was really really good as well.
Seriously, this place is amazing, I highly recommend it to anyone.",1
5,"Have lived around the area for about 5 years and have tried loads of the restaurants on upper street and always come back to this one as my favourite. It is excellent value for money, has a cosy, romantic atmosphere and the food is always delicious",1
4,"Mmmm....thinking about the chicken I ordered from here puts me in a happy place. My husband pork was equally juicy and tasty. We often have the bad luck of getting served meat that is overcooked and not very flavorful. Not the case with Le Mercury. My chicken was like butta baby. And the cream sauce on it was just enough, not too much or too little. 
The prices are right but the food is even better. Make sure you book in advance. I've walked in hoping for a seat and have had to walk away disappointed more than once (should have learned the first time!).
Oh yeah! Be sure to try their deep-fried tiger prawns as a starter. AMAZING.",1
5,"My roommate and I ate here one lazy Sunday afternoon a few months ago and it was fantastic.
4 Starters: Poached pear & salad, mussels, french onion soup, lobster/crayfish ravioli?
1 Entree: Roast duck, mash, something else
20 GBP. Total. Absolutely ridiculous, but absolutely delicious. I have been trying to get more of my friends to try it so I have an excuse to eat there!",1
4,"I booked Le Mercury for a late Saturday dinner, thanks to all the brilliant recommendations from my fellow yelpers ;) Needless to say, I was not let down. What a find on Upper Street. 
Le Mercury is a great date spot. The ambiance is cozy and romantic, dimly lit. The restaurant was PACKED, all three floors even, so be sure to book. I booked about 4 days ahead and they only had one reservation for the whole evening left. Wowie.
Prices are so reasonable! We weren't modest at all, with drinks or food, and our tab only came out to 38 quid! For our starter we had the goats cheese which is absolutely TO DIE FOR. It's a must paired with the French merlot on the menu. Take a nice bite of the cheese with a swig of the wine and trust me, it's divine. For my main I had both the pear salad and the crab appetiser. The salad was lovely, the blue cheese and poached pair were the perfect combination. However, I was not a fan of the crab dish as it was made with mayonnaise, which I hate. I really wished they had clarified on the menu how it was made. BUT it worked out alright because I wanted to have room for desert anyway. My man enjoyed the duck entree, which he said was cooked perfectly and was ""out of this world."" And yes, only for 6.95!
The reason why I didn't give Le Mercury 5 stars is because the service isn't good. But I do personally think sacrificing the level of service to keep the ridiculously cheap prices IS worth it. However, we did always have to flag our waiter down and we weren't greeted at our table until about 15 minutes after sitting. But lets face it, they were packed and this place was hoppin. I understand.
Le Mercury is a go! Book for a hot date with your Mr./Ms. and you'll score points!",1
3,"Take a nice bite of the
cheese with a swig of the wine and trust me, it's divine. For the main we had

to spend my dinner and I can't go wrong for they served well cooked food and a
friendly and attentive staff and it is the key for aneffective restaurant!The
food was flavourful and very affordable priced, the service was superb, and the

waiting for, it is a highly recommended place for everyone.",1
4,"Uh-Mazing. 
Cheap.
Delicious. 
Nuff said. 
My boyfriend and I went for a late sunday dinner at 9 pm after reading the reviews on Yelp. What a treat. We ordered 3 appetizers, followed by lamb and duck and then a poached pear dessert. It was all heavenly and perfectly cooked. 
Do yourself a favor and go. Prices are great!!",1
5,"Le Mercury is a great spot for good-value French food in a cosy, romantic setting. Most striking is the amazingly low price everything is: I had a mains, dessert and wine for just £16, fantastic stuff. The service is quick and friendly and there's a cloakroom where the waiters will happily stow any bags you may have for no charge.
Unsurprisingly this is a popular place and though it's spread over several floors, a reservation is advisable.
Overall: one of the best-value restaurants on Upper Street and well-worth checking out.",1
4,"Finally checked into Le Mercury to find out the hype and I am pretty happy of the find. To start, the prices of the food on the menu are considered affordable based on London pricing. The food is michellin star but tasty especially for its price. I had the goat cheese salad with pesto and honey glazed pork belly, while my husband had the calamari, ravioli and lamb. Looking back, I regretted skipping the delectable dessert. All these plus our beverage definitely made our belly and taste buds happy as well my wallet. In addition, the ambiance and the service in Le Mercury quite excellent to my liking. Definitely, enjoyed this dinner date with the Mister in hip Islington area courtesy of Le Mercury. See for yourself.",1
4,"This place. So cozy. Every time I walk past it, I wish that my plans for the evening involved meeting friends here for dinner. Candles and steamed up windows and just...a buzz. A really good buzz. 
The food is excellent and well-priced for what you get. The staff is efficient. I dislike the papery table cloths, but that seems like a lame complaint, doesn't it? The chicken is great. Steak is great. Veggie options are great. 
I hesitate to give it five stars, though. Maybe if it wasn't so hyped, I wouldn't have had such high expectations. It really was good. Really! But I don't feel right giving it five stars just because. The food has been solid every time I've been there, but it's not the best ever. When I take the first bite of a meal in Paris, I often have to close my eyes because it's so delicious and I want to melt. That magic was not recreated here, but it is still really solidly GOOD food. 
I feel guilty not giving it five stars because I really do like this place! A lot! And now you know just how tormented a place my brain really is.",1
3,"I went here with a big party and I was impressed with how patient and efficient the service was. The food was not great though - my crab starter did definitely taste of crab but in a way that made me wonder if it had gone straight from a tin to a plate. Pork belly was pretty good and the dessert was standard. I'm giving it 3 stars because of its incredible value even though 3 courses for £15 in London shouldn't be something of a miracle, unfortunately it is and so thanks Le Mercury for that. But really on food quality it's more like 2 stars, based on my one experience there.",-1
5,"I`m big fan of Le Mercury. The food here is awesome and the prices are 
unbelievable. The best ratio quality/price. The main courses are only £9
 which for Islington and for the such delicious food is pretty good 
deal. The wines are around £15. I can`t say enough, just go there and try 
it. Strongly recommend it, one of my favourite places.",1
4,"This place has a wonderful atmosphere--it's cozy and dimly lit.  Folk on a first date would do well to dine at Le Mercury.  :)  
And, for French food, it's really reasonably priced.  Other reviewers have mentioned prices, so I'll not reiterate them here.
Just know that if you're wanting to go into that area town for a solidly good, well-priced dinner in a place with good atmosphere, then Le Mercury is it!",1
4,"Excellent value on Upper Street, among restaurants that are usually overpriced!
 The atmosphere is romantic, making this the perfect place to bring a date if you are on a budget. All starters cost £3.95 and all main courses at £6.95. They do have a changing daily menu with more expensive options, but they are only at £7.95.
 Portions are rather big, making this an extremely good value place. The main courses were a bit slow to arrive, but the service in general was very prompt.
 The menu has a french slant, with many British dishes as well. Unusual ones include frogs legs, along with the traditional steaks and leg of lamb.",1
4,"Do you like to be tasked with choosing a place to eat or are you one of those who like to leave it to others? 
For me, I'm happy either way. These two restaurants serving French cuisine were suggested by friends I was catching up with and that I haven't heard of. One was to celebrate a birthday and the other was visiting friends in town. 
Let's start with a birthday dinner at Le Mercury. It was a cold windy evening and I was walking with a fast pace dreaming of the warmth that will greet me when I open the doors of the restaurant. In I went and was led up a flight of narrow wooden stairs to my table. 
It was a very reasonably priced menu with all starters priced at £3.95
We ordered a trio of starters starting with the Calamars Fris which is deep fried calamari with home made tartar sauce and dressed French leaves on the side, Beef Carpaccio with capers and red peppers relish and finishing with the Ravioli de la Mer, a crayfish and lobster ravioli with spinach and shellfish sauce.
For mains which were all price at £6.95, there was the sea bass fillet with crushed new potatoes and minted pesto, a rib eye steak served with shallot sauce and a Scottish salmon with sautéed spinach and lobster sauce. 
We all had a great time soaking in the atmosphere and vibe. It can indeed be quite a romantic place. The food may not be outstanding but is decent and with those prices, reflects a good value. An unassuming place that might not reside in your memories for long but will be thought of fondly if this happens to be part of your local eaterie.",1
5,"Extremely affordable French restaurant in Islington. Do not be fooled into thinking they are closed at night, as all tables are lit by only candle light and it looks quite dark from the outside.",1
3,"I would really like to give this place 3.5 stars.  It's good.  And great for the price.  Three of us showed up at 930 on a Saturday without a reservation, and we were seated despite the place being busy.
The service was friendly and fast, and the food was well seasoned.
Two of us ordered the duck, while our third companion stuck with a starter.  The duck was tasty, and the mash and cabbage it came with were quite good.  However, it was realy very overcooked.  And it wasn't just mine, it was both of us.  Now, at £8, I really wasn't inclined to complain, and I will still go back.  As I said, tasty.  Still overcooked duck is just not ideal.  3.5 stars it is.",-1
2,"I'm quite bemused by all the positive reviews for this place. Took a date here and was somewhat embarrassed at how poor quality the food was. For Angel, I was expecting better.",-1
1,"Very disappointing! We came here after several recommendations (and reading the positive reviews here), and found the food mediocre at best.  I had the crab and crayfish ravioli and the pork belly, and my wife had the crab and avocado starter and the beef stew special.  The crab in both appetisers was imitation crab meat, which was not mentioned on the menu and was particularly noticeable in the special.  The pork belly was dry and overcooked and the beef stew was virtually flavourless.  The two bright spots were the wine and the sticky toffee pudding (which in my opinion is good even when it's bad).
Granted, the prices are extremely generous, but considering you can get 2 courses and a glass of wine for £17 at places like Public House, I wonder if Le Mercury is really that good a deal.  
Maybe we just went on a bad night or maybe we ordered the wrong items, but will definitely not be returning any time soon, particularly with so many other great restaurants in the area.",-1
5,"Truly a hidden gem of affordable London dining. I don't know what to add that others haven't said, but you can get a really nice, romantic 3-course meal for around £15. Amazing. 
Crispy skinned salmon was delicious, and I really like the calamari starter-- super light and crisp, not overly oily or breaded... perfectly simple French preparation. 
You could probably name each ingredient in every dish (with probably under 5 ingredients in each dish), they are all things you can pronounce and identify, done simply and cleanly. Mark Bittman would approve of this place. In fact, Mark, next time you're in London, check this place out, ok?",1
5,"Le Mercury would probably be an awesome place for a date. When I am someday able to trick a girl into going on a date with me, I will be able to verify this for sure. However, the atmosphere, wine, food, and wine all seem to make this a safe bet. 
I've tried the lobster ravioli, the duck (err... canard), the potato dumplings, the salmon, the sea bass, and a couple of the desserts. All were either very good or great. For some extra Frenchness, they refused my sister's simple meal modification request- no, the sauce could not be had on the side. Authentique!
The best part is that it is so inexpensive. Considering how good the food is, 8 quid for a main course is a steal. That means you will have some money left over to treat your special lady to a couple drinks at that most romantic of bars just down the street- Slim Jim's Liquor Store! No way will that date not end well, eh?",1
4,"Good decor, good food, great prices.  Had the crayfish and lobster ravioli starter and the ribeye steak (mixed vegetables).  My friend ordered two starters:  the ravioli and the calamari.  I believe the ravioli was the star here as it was served along a buttery seafood sauce that was balanced very well with the spinach in the dish.  
Tried my friend's calamari and to be candid, it wasn't the greatest (doesn't match the fantastic fried Calamari I exprienced at the Capital Grille in Philadelphia, absolutely tasty!!!).  Seasoned ok, a bit cold for my taste.
Out came my steak and it was so flavorful and tasty!!  Downside here was that it could've been more tender (ordered it medium) and it felt like it was warm, but not hot.  Next time will tell them to bring everything out as its ready so it's nice and hot!!
We didn't have desert as we were too full.  Final verdict: nice decore, good food, can't beat the prices for a nice, sit down French meal in London.  With some fine tuning this place would be amazing and I would definitely return (to try the Seabass and desert!!).",1
5,"I gave Le Mercury 5 stars because It's great food, well cooked by nice people for an excellent price. That's got to be ""as good as it gets"". 
I ordered the goats cheese salad to start, the duck with garlic mash (which i can't recommend enough) for my main coarse and an espresso to end the evening.
I would recommend making a reservation if you plan on going on a Friday or Saturday night. It's an extremely busy restaurant, nevertheless they maintain a high standard of customer service (CS)",1
4,"This is one of those cases when I wish Yelp allowed reviewers to rate with half stars. I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could. It's definitely not the most bomb-diggity French food I've ever had, but for the price and the atmosphere, I think this place is worth a try. 
I had mussels to start and the lamb for my main. The mussels were good. The lamb was a tad chewy, but pretty good. I only got it because it was recommended to me by the waiter.
My friend ordered the gnocchi, which was sub-standard. 
My other friend had the foie gras and the duck. Due to the only-child syndrome, she didn't offer to share, so I'm not sure how those tasted, though I'm assuming she enjoyed it since she licked her plate clean. 
All in all, I think this place is a good find just because affordable, decent French food is hard to come by. Just don't expect your taste buds to be blown away.",1
5,"Oh how I love having phenomenal restaurants within walking distance from my flat. I took girlfriend here on a Friday night - luckily called ahead and made a reservation.
I actually got this establishment off of Yelp - ahh how this website never steers your in the wrong direction. 
We sat down and ordered a bottle of Rose and their fantastic mussels. It was a long drawn out dining experience, and I cannot think of anywhere else I would have rather spent two hours eating and drinking.
For our main courses I ordered their Duck breast while girlfriend ordered their braised shank steak. Both dishes were fabulously prepared to our lofty expectations.
When we were complete, another bottle of Rose came out along with their Cheesecake.
Two hours and about 2000 calories later - and we were both smiling ear to ear.
Bravo Le Mercury.",1
5,"Overall an excellent experience. I came here on a Friday night (with a reservation) with two other people. This restaurant has some sort of ""shift"" system, I think, where all the diners come in at once. I arrived a little before 9:15pm (for a 9:15 pm reservation) and the place was empty; by 9:20pm it was full and buzzing. I've never seen this system before but I suppose there could be some advantages.
The restaurant itself is lovely. We sat on the first floor, where large windows look onto the street. Nicely arranged tables and decor. I would say it seemed a bit noisy at times, but I am sometimes a bit sensitive to loudness. (I loathe most night clubs.) The bathrooms in the basement are a bit lackluster, so I didn't spend much time down there.
The servers were good and attentive. We ordered a very nice bottle of merlot and to start shared mussels and poached pear with walnuts and blue cheese; all were very good. I had the roast chicken as entree and it was great, very tender and moist. I sampled my companions' dishes as well - sea bass and duck - and both were succulent to say the least. The portions did not seem like much but the richness of the foods really filled me up. We also squeezed in some dessert - creme brulee and the dark chocolate tort. Delicious they both were.
The main draw of Le Mercury, though, has to be the prices. Wine: appx. £15 for a bottle, starters £3.95 each, entrees £7.95 each, desserts £2.95 each. For London these prices really are unheard of. 
I will recommend this place to everybody, and I hope to go back soon.",1
4,"Décor: Dark, romantic but not stuffy-uncomfortable. What's amazing is that this place has like 3-4 floors! (How come no one mentioned that???) It's amazing what they did here! The first floor, I could tell was more date-ish, but the second/third floor I was on was great because it was groups of friends (Some dates, not all) and it was just a great friendly atmosphere.
Service: Fantastic. Nothing to complain about!
Food: 
- Appetizer: Mussels in a broccoli sort of soup? It was good! Good amount and the sauce/soup it was in was delicious. I've had moules frites (in Belgium!) and this was definitely good in comparison to it.
- Pork with confit: I thought it was a bit dry. I ate all of it.. minus a bit of the pork. My friend go the lamb which she enjoyed and I thought had a good flavour to it.
- Dessert: Pear- YUM. 
Bottom Line: Decent prices, decent food. Even though I went with just a girl friend, we liked to say that it was definitely a 'romantic' dinner date, ahahha ;)",1
5,"A starter and a main for little under £12. Splendid. Almost everyone who comes here likes it and I'm afraid I'm part of the crowd now.
An intimate and ambient restaurant which spans three floors (apparently anyway, I entered at ground level - as you may expect - and stayed there), Le Mercury does the romance without the finance.
The menu isn't particularly extensive but manages variety with main meals like steak, duck, chicken and a couple of fish dishes as well as two or three vegetarian options. I had a goats cheese thing for a starter and a pork belly thing for a main - lovely. There are many drinks choices. A place I'll definitely return to.
TTFN, Ian",1
3,"A visit to Le Mercury was inevitable as I watch this little gem fill up every night without fail. The blue and yellow interior might lead you astray however with a simple menu and excellent prices, Le Mercury is everything French and nothing less. The crayfish and lobster ravioli was minutely salty for my liking but was succulent enough to still enjoy. At £2.95 a plate, it's alright to order the entire dessert menu.. if only I could stomach everything, I would. Mascapone cheese Cake - a lighter alternative but still as rich and as enjoyable as a normal cheesecake. Love, love, LOVE!",-1
5,"Yes, yes and yes. And yes.
Friendly staff, intimate seating, outstanding food, decent prices, fantastic wine... you can't really go wrong can you? 
Sure it's not the best french food in the capital, of course it's not, but it is ridiclously good and it tastes even better when you appreciate how little you're paying for it. 
We had three courses... why the devil not?
I might just be in love with their garlic mash. I could marry it.
Omnomnomnom.",1
5,"I went here once years ago and it was amazing (!) and then I immediately forgot about it. Why would I forget?   Probably there is a curse on the entrees like in a French fairytale that goes like, ""The food here will be so great and amazing you will feel like you have found the perfect food, BUT you will forget about its amazingness shortly after digesting it"". Curses!
But, this is one of my favorite spots in London- so long as I remember it exists. The entrees are delightful. I had pork belly on a bed of (not over cooked) cabbage covered in a berry sauce that my taste buds singing the opening of ""The Sound of Music"". Actually, I refer to this place as French-ish, because I'm not sure if it is supposed to be totally French (mainly because its such an unassuming and friendly place. Ooooh burn, France!)
The most magical thing about this restaurant are the prices.... you will do a double take when you get the bill. I heard somewhere that this place is like a training restaurant for chefs or something but I don't care.... I really don't. I just want to go there again and again. 
I think I may be in love with a restaurant....
I think it gets pretty busy on the weekends so you may want to make a reservation but it does stay open until 1 so its perfect for a late, late dinner.",1
5,"I'm going to sound like a broken record here, but when you sit at a buzzy romantic restaurant, drink delicious wine, interact with friendly staff, eat so much French fabulousness you want to le burst, and to top things off you then receive a bill for three people that you'd expect to be for one, you can't resist that big 5. 
(Seriously: Bottle of wine, two entrees and two starters for under £30 including tax and tip. WORD.)
Le yes.",1
5,"Le Mercury is a great find. The food is really great and the service outstanding. The restaurant is right across the road from the Almeida Theatre which makes it a great place for pre or post theatre dining.
If you tell them you have a show to see, the service is even faster.",1
4,"WIN! this place was so cheap and STILL REALLY GOOD! i heard that it's hard to get a seat, but it was open late so we rocked up and they made a bit of a fuss but then they seated us.
The atmosphere was so French and romantic, I was a bit embarrassed to come stumbling in after an upper street drink session... but the lights were so dim I don't think anyone noticed. I still can't get over how much food we got for how cheap it was! I think I will come back when I intentionally want to bring a date...",1
4,"Went to Le Mercury as a last minute decision with a friend. We got served straight away which was great. This also meant that we got our food very quickly ( a bit too quickly..we were in and out of the door within 40 minutes). Saying that the food was very nice. The prices are so reasonable because of the fast turn around and it is obligatory to order sides with your mains as you won't get any veg or carbs on your plate.
 All in all a nice little place to go if you don't want to spend hours on your meal or have a play/film to catch.",1
3,"It's crazy how quickly this little restaurant fills up at night, but I'm not surprised given the prices of the food. Starters are all £3.98 and mains are £8. For starters my partner and I ordered the lobster & crayfish ravioli and the fried calamari. The lobster and crayfish ravioli was a bit overpowered by the dill stuffed inside and wasn't amazing. The fried calamari is horrendous and I can make better at home but for not even 4 pounds a pop I guess I can't complain. I ordered the duck, and it was very overcooked, but the flavors were good. The garlic mash is delicious. My boyfriend had the lamb and also said it was good but overcooked. I would probably return and ask them to cook everything a bit less than they normally would. The price is terrific and a 5 min walk from my flat, so what's not to love?
If I could I would rate it 3.5 stars",-1
4,"We made an unplanned visit to Le Mercury a few weeks back and we'll definitely be back.
I had the calamari to start and porkbelly for mains, my girl had the pear and blue cheese salad and the veg. cassoulet. We couldn't really fault the food - we really enjoyed everything we ordered. 
It's not mind-blowing - just really soild food at a great price.
It was busy and the service was efficient - we didn't book and managed to walk in and get a table, but other people after us weren't so lucky. Would definitely recommend making a booking.
If you're in the area Le Mercury is definitely worth checking out.",1
4,"fantastic French bistro amidst the already awesome Islington Upper Street fare. Prices are VERY good considering the quality and variety of the food offered (£7 for main courses, £3 for dessert, a bit more for the daily specials). Went for a flatmate's birthday dinner with a party of about 10 or so, and the service was below average -- we literally asked for a pitcher of water FIVE times before they finally listened ... and it was at the end of a meal.
Otherwise, a perfectly good restaurant!",1
5,"I recommend this place to anyone. I've been eating here for over 20 years. It's great for a quiet lunch or a full on dinner gathering with 20 mates. Three floors, drippy candles in old wine bottles, simple, quality French food. Amazingly reasonable prices. They have always maintained a fixed price for starters (£3.95), mains(£8.95) and puds (£2.50) .It's maintained it's quirky, unique, old-school Islington vibe. I hope it never changes.",1
5,"My guy works late, so if I am lucky during the week we can have dinner together if we can find a restaurant with a kitchen open past 10 and one that won't rush us out at 10:59.  So I was thrilled to find that Le Mercury stays open late!  Thank you!  
I love authentic French bistros serving up foie gras, chevre chaud, duck breast, entrecote steaks, etc.  And I love it when it tastes delicious.  And I love it when the bill comes to £40 for two, we ate lots, and that tab included a very nice bottle of wine!    
We had a nice secluded table in the corner by a nice round window and had an extremely pleasant meal.
It reminds me a bit of Grumbles by Victoria Station--I guess I am just a fan of authentic French bistros at an affordable price.  
Could this be my new fave in Angel?  I think so!",1
4,"The food here is pretty good even for my french friend's standards. The place is nice and bright, the prices are exceptionally cheap and the food is great. Definitely a must try if you are in the area!",1
4,"I'd heard great things about Le Mercury and it didn't let me down. Although it's best to book, we were lucky to get a table upstairs on the spur of the moment one evening.
 My God, it's so cheap! It's a simple menu with lots of French classics to choose from, but the food is delicious.
 OK, the service isn't the best, but Le Mercury still has charm and atmosphere, and at those prices you really can't grumble.",1
5,"Comparing this to the type of service and food I would have in the States, an incredible value. For tourists, its a bit out there (~ 21 GBP from victoria by taxi), but def. worth a visit.
I went with a few other friends from across the pond and we all loved the atmosphere (nice, but not pretentious), service, and food. None of us were French food snobs, but we all thorough enjoyed the lamb, salmon, gnocchi, and casserole (though the casserole was a bit bland and very heavy on the beans). 
The apps were great, and paired very well with our French wine.
Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with what a nice dinner like this cost us. Check their website for details. Also, I would recommend setting reservations for parties larger than 2, even on a weeknight as many people have found this gem.",1
5,"What an absolutely delightful restaurant! Went there with my Mum and sister. Beautifully prepared French food. I had the blue cheese and walnut for starter, with delicious light salad dressing. My Mum had the prawns which she found delicious. For mains I had the sea bass, the staff were so accommodating allowing me to swop one side for another of my choice. Overall food was decadent, decor was elegant, staff were superb, and atmosphere relaxing allowing us to immerse ourselves in wonderful food and conversation. Would highly recommend Le Mercury.",1
4,"I went to Le Mercury {Deuxieme} which is less than 200 feet from Le Mercury and has exactly the same menu.
The first thing you notice about the menu are the prices, they are so reasonable! And with each course all dishes are the same price: starters £3.95, mains £8.95 and puddings £2.95, so it is perfect for a group of friends sharing or a date going dutch.
And the restaurant had a good mix of groups, friends and dates, so it appears to be suitable for every occasion.
Portions are not big, so those with big appetites might want to add some sides which are again very reasonable at £1.95.
I had the duck, in fact most of my group did, and it was delicious. The meat was so tender, and it came with a creamy garlic mash and a rich jus. I would definitely recommend.
Additionally: One of our party was 40 minutes late, and although they did keep asking us how much longer they thought she would be, they were very good about it. They refilled our (complimentary) bread while we were waiting.",1
5,"I really enjoy Le Mercury. 
It's simple as that. The food is good and for great prices. And I just love the atmosphere. I love to come on lazy Sundays and have the roasts. On a nice day, the large windows let the street right in. But if you're coming for a romantic dinner, don't forget to make reservations and the buzz throughout the place.",1
4,"Tucked right on the corner of Almeida Street and Upper Street, this little French Bistro is a wonderful little find. It's no fine dining establishment, but if you are looking for cheap, tasty and typically French cuisine - this is your Ronseal. (Does exactly what is says on the tin).
 Its dark enough to be intimate, but romantically lit with candles enough to see your dinner (and guest). The waiters are very efficient... some may say a little too eager to get you in, served and out, but I'm quite partial to a bit of efficiency on a cold wintery night when I'm starving. A three course meal will set you back £17. And that's the entire menu - starters, mains and desserts are all the same price.
 Toilets are fairly interesting... but clean.
 We dined on Carpaccio of Beef, Fois Gras, Sea Bass, Belly Pork, Marscapone Cheesecake and Sticky Toffee pudding. Delicious. Can't comment on the booze as we were driving, but French wine isn't really my thing anyway. Oh - driving - easy peasy. You can park on Almeida Street and the streets behind the restaurant from 6.30pm Pay and Display. Biking? Bike bay just on Napier Street - it couldn't be more convenient!
 Go on - have an indulgent Monday night out - and keep your wallet happy at the same time.",1
4,"Brilliant prices. Brilliant prices!!
This is the place to be - because it is so very credit crunch friendly..and whats not to like about that!
It is warm and wooden and for some strange reason makes me think of a restaurant in a ski village (mostly because it has that 2 door thing going on)..it is candle lit so adds a bit of romance..so be sure to take 'your lovely' there.
I was delighted to pay £15 for 2 courses and a glass of wine - was nice nosh too",1
2,"Plumped for Le Mercury having never before been. Pack them in (with little room to move and waiters crashing into my chair) and serve it cheap is the name of the game. Decor is lovely and service efficient so expectations were high. 
The Brie starter was adequate however the Moulles was excellent, in a delightful creamy sauce which was swiftly despatched. 
The food went downhill when we received our main courses. The meat of both the Rib Eye and the ""special"" of the day, not veal or pork but thick slab of beef Weinersnitchel, was inedible and akin to chewing gum. We both left most of our mains and when we commented to waiter on quality of meat we were met with a ""would you like to order anything else from the menu"", implying we pay for another main. We declined, polished off our wine and left.",-1
5,"Time and time again this place does not disappoint.  Just to add to everything that they do fabulously, I celebrated my 25th birthday here and was a bit obnoxious about the reservations because I started with 9 and called them almost every day for a week to up the number to 15. 
As it was a Monday night, there was no problems and we were pretty much given the entire top floor (maybe because we were also pretty happy, loud and drunk).  We all got 2 or 3 courses, the food came out promptly, had about 8 bottles of wine, a few beers and the total came out to £21/person. 
I can't stress how amazing it is to have GOOD food for such a great price, it's really a good place for large groups as it keeps things cheap but a fabulous meal!",1
4,"This is a lovely little place, we went before going to see a movie on Upper Street. The food was delicious and reasonably priced, mains were 6.95 - you could have a side dish as well for £3.50, which we didn't have as trying to cut back but the mains were things like pork belly and greens, so obviously if you wanted some carbs with that it would be a tenner for a main..
But good service and atmosphere, and gorgeous food.",1
4,"Cheap French food?  What?  Looking for a relatively inexpensive place to eat in Islington, I came across Le Mercury.  All of their entrees are priced at £7.45, appetizers are a mere £3.95, and the wines and other drinks are more than reasonable (around £3-4 for a glass of wine).
I opted for the crispy-skinned sea bass, which came with some really delicious potatoes and pesto.  It was all perfectly cooked and a perfect portion size for me.  My friend ordered the steak and he loved it...a rarity for him, since he's usually got something to complain about no matter where he goes!
Although we came in quite late without a reservation we were still seated immediately with a quick warning that they were closing in 45 minutes or so...though that didn't end up mattering much at all, since the service was incredibly quick.
The atmosphere is a bit romantic-y, with candles and all of that, but it wasn't filled with the kind of gooey lovey couples who might make a night out with a platonic male friend a bit awkward.
I just wish I'd tried something from the dessert menu...Oh well.  Just gives me an excuse to go back!",1
5,"Le Mercury is an amazing hidden gem in London.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is cozy, and the prices cannot be beat.  I suggest trying the duck entree and the poached pear dessert, both of which are some of the best dishes I have ever experienced.  Every time I am in London I will be eating at Le Mercury.",1
5,"Not bad...not bad at all....and when I say not bad, I really mean, really quite amazing actually. Would be a perfect place to go this Valentines on a special date!!  The duck was lovely and as for the garlic mash it came with.....OMG...wow!!! mmmm i know what all the fuss is about now! And cheap tooooo...",1
4,"The atmosphere, the location & service was very good, the food was excellent, abit on the pricy side for the food on offer though in my opinion. The portion sizes was adequate, good place for a romantic meal for 2!!!",1
4,"A romantic candlelit French restaurant which stands out from the crowd on Upper Street - go there with a good looking person to gaze at over candlelight and unwind with a good bottle of French wine.  The best thing about this place is the value for money compared to other restaurants in the area, a glance at the menu may leave you feeling a little nervous about the cuisine but don't be put off by the almost too modest prices. 
The food would have been excellent if it had been hotter, but this is a restaurant that's packed almost every night of the week and the highly efficient waiters are rushed off their feet to deliver food to all three floors of the restaurant (you will probably have to book - try to get a table on the ground floor).  A great place to take someone if you're on a budget - because you won't feel like you are.",1
5,"This place is seriously amazing - i'm genuinely stunned by its existence. The food is fantastic bistro fare (heavy on duck, pork belly etc), the service wonderfully welcoming, the place is always packed yet i've never failed to get a table without booking, it is astonishingly good value and it is the epitome of a candlelit romantic setting that adapts to every season and it is not far at all from Angel Tube. If I lived in North London, I would be there all the time.",1
4,"Excellent value, flavoursome French food. Candle lit for a warm ambience. Perfect for dinner with a partner, to impress without a big price tag, or a small group of friends. With most dishes priced the same its easy to split bill between a group, without any tight fists getting their knickers in a twist over who's meal was more expensive!",1
4,"Le Mercury is a good solid restaurant with tasty food and reliable service.  When I can't get a reservation at Ottolenghi across the street, I'm not disappointed by Le Mercury as a backup.  I have them saved in my phone. 
The moules marinieres are perfect and not rubbery, the duck is always cooked to perfection, the salmon juicy, the lobster ravioli is a winner, and although I've never had it, the pork belly always seems to make my husband very satiated.  The deserts are nice, but their strengths are their starters and mains.  The wine list has a fair mix of options, most worth buying by the bottle and none too offensively priced. 
The last two times I have been there I've been seated upstairs which is more private, but I prefer the seating downstairs for a cafe/french style atmosphere.",1

Do you like to be tasked with choosing a place to eat or are you one of those who like to leave it to others?
For me, I'm happy either way. These two restaurants serving French cuisine were suggested by friends I was catching up with and that I haven't heard of. One was to celebrate a birthday and the other was visiting friends in town.
Let's start with a birthday dinner at Le Mercury. It was a cold windy evening and I was walking with a fast pace dreaming of the warmth that will greet me when I open the doors of the restaurant. In I went and was led up a flight of narrow wooden stairs to my table.
It was a very reasonably priced menu with all starters priced at £3.95
We ordered a trio of starters starting with the Calamars Fris which is deep fried calamari with home made tartar sauce and dressed French leaves on the side, Beef Carpaccio with capers and red peppers relish and finishing with the Ravioli de la Mer, a crayfish and lobster ravioli with spinach and shellfish sauce.
For mains which were all price at £6.95, there was the sea bass fillet with crushed new potatoes and minted pesto, a rib eye steak served with shallot sauce and a Scottish salmon with sautéed spinach and lobster sauce.
We all had a great time soaking in the atmosphere and vibe. It can indeed be quite a romantic place. The food may not be outstanding but is decent and with those prices, reflects a good value. An unassuming place that might not reside in your memories for long but will be thought of fondly if this happens to be part of your local eaterie.",1
2,"OK I know I'm going against the grain here but bear with me.  I went a couple of weeks ago for the first time with Lucy who raves about it so I had high expectations. A major bonus was the fact that due to volcanic activity (what else?), mutual friend's flight was seriously delayed so we arrived about 45mins after we had the table booked for.  There was no problem with this, despite the fact that it is nearly always fully-booked so that was great. Lucy noted that the prices had gone up since the last time she'd been, so while still cheap (7.45, specials of the day around 9 or 10 pounds), not as cheap as they used to be.  My starter was great, my steak was cooked to perfection but not of the highest quality as I was still chewing it over literally 10 minutes after Lucy and friend had finished. Not a good look! The sticky toffee pudding (a passion of mine) was a little dry and not as sticky as it should have been.
I thought I'd give it another go for boyfriend's birthday meal as everyone else seems to think it's amazing so I wondered if I'd gone on an off-night. 
Not so, sadly.  The maitre d' sat us, a waiter brought over some wine (complementary wine! How thoughtful!) but it wasn't ours and turned out to be the first of many errors of the evening.  After some time, the maitre d' took our order without writing it down (why do people do this? I've been a waitress and could NEVER remember orders without writing them down - it turns out that this guy couldn't either) so when the starters came, I got the soup I'd ordered, boyfriend got something he didn't.  It was replaced quickly though and we had complementary bread and butter to keep us going which is a plus. 
My soup was a disappointment though. French onion is another passion of mine but I make it far better than what I was given - watery, thin, with little flavour.  Boyfriend's poached pear with blue cheese was lovely though. 
Some 45 minutes after we had had our starter, I asked where our main courses were and they arrived soon after. I think 45 minutes is a very long time between courses and we were filling up on bread.
Anyway, for main I had pork belly which I'd expected to be a slice of meat layered with fat and with a nice chunk of crackling on top. Again, not so. It was a huge lump of tasty pork, not a scrap of crackling to be seen and not enough jus to counteract the dryness of the meat.  I ended up drinking so much water with it (I can't leave meat, an animal has died for this so I'm not wasting any of it!) that by the end of the meal I was absolutely full to bursting. So much meat and you only get vegetables / chips etc if you order them (1.95 on top) which presented another problem. I ordered a side salad (mixed leaves, 4 slices of cucumber with only the slightest hint of dressing, 1.95 seems very steep for that) while boyfriend ordered chips and a vegetable selection which it seems the maitre d' forgot.  When we reminded him, we were shortly presented a plate of beans, new potatoes and the oddest carrots which looked like they had been boiled, then left in a low oven for many hours so that all the water had been removed from them. Wrinkled, dehydrated and burnt around the edges. Very strange and not nice to eat! 
By the end of all that, I wasn't hungry for dessert which is just as well as it took another 20 minutes to get the bill.  
Not bad in that the whole thing was 35.00 for 2 people with a glass of wine and a beer but I wonder if we're all mistaking good value for cheap?
Let me know if I'm wrong, but I'm not charmed by Le Mercury.",-1
4,"Intimate, romantic, and delicious.  All the elements that define French cuisine.  Affordable is the one missing element Le Mercury adds to the formula.  I love the friendly waiters and will be back whenever I celebrate with my special one!",1
5,"Wow! Now this is a rare find - gourmet quality for mainstream prices! I almost don't want to review this place so that people don't flood it, but I want them to continue doing their beautiful thing!
 We went here after a week in Dijon, where we were sickened by the high prices for relatively little quality. Coming back to London to find this awesome little place was such a contrast.
 We started off by only wanting main and perhaps dessert, but ended up having wine and all three courses! Every single course was amazing. I recommend this as one of my favourite places in Angel!",1
5,"I love this place with absolutely all of my heart. Although the food probably only warrants a 4-star rating, I love this place enough to rate it a 5-star. Honest, unpretentious French food at ridiculous prices, a fantastic atmosphere, and decent wine - and on Upper St.",1
5,"Hello new favourite restaurant!
 Seriously, is there nothing this place doesn't offer? When someone suggests a French restaurant, you immediately think it's going to be pricey, but this couldn't be further from the truth. All of the mains are under £7, desserts under £3.
 So what did we have? Well we shared a starter of Crayfish and Lobster ravioli which was yummy. really nice. I think we were both a bit annoyed that we didn't order one each.
 But the mains were ace too - it's not a huge selection, but it's a good one. I had duck breast on garlic mash with cabbage. It had a great sauce, although I can't remember what was in it. The mash was really too garlicky for my taste, but the duck was perfect. Yummy yummy yummy. We didn't get a side of veg with our meals, but we did spie roasted potatoes and green beans on a nother table and were instantly jealous. My friend's mushroom rissotto was yummy too. Dessert was a mascarpone cheesecake. YUMMY!
 There was nothing bad about this place, it's a gorgeous little find. We booked ahead, and we might have been lucky but it's not a bad idea. The service isn't the best, but my friends and i were catching up so we didn't really mind that they didn't take our order for a while - in fact I think they were waiting for us to shut up! In the meantime we ate all of the bread that they gave us. Freshest bread eve. The place is open very late (1am on weekdays, 2am on weekends) so you could even pop in after going to the cinema. It's a little further up Upper Street than the main drag, but that's a good thing. If I was just looking for somewhere to grab a bite to eat, I wouldn't have walked up this far. I'm so pleased I did!
 So one starter, one dessert and two very yummy mains, plus a couple of glasses of wine costs us £26. Very impressed indeed.
 Do come here! On a date, with friends, whatever. Just come here. We were in such a mood for all things French that we've booked the Eurostar to Paris next month! Doesn't get much better",1
4,"Friendly service and delicious food.  And don't be put off if you walk in and it seems full, there are tables upstairs.  Will be back next time in the area for sure!",1
4,"I love the simplicity of the prices of this place.  All appetizers, entrees and desserts are a set price.  Whether you get the duck or beef it is the same.  It is not Michelin star but the food is really good and the price is right.  French food and candle lights, just don't screw it up by saying something dumb and it is the recipe for a really good romantic date.",1
4,"Whilest the French food here is amazing, their roasts weren't so hot. I had the beef roast and it was...meh. Not bad. Not good. Rather mediocre. If you're  coming to a french restaurant, don't eat the British food. Common sense I should have had then but now consider a learned lesson in my culinary adventures.",1
3,"Reasonable quality food, hence the price.  If the credit crunch is hitting you hard then this a good place to take that special someone without having to spend too much.  It is pretty much always busy, maybe I am being too harsh on the food quality rating but I have been to many french restaurants and have had better, because I've paid more.  The starter was the best out of the three dishes, it was the mussels in white wine (not as fresh, but they were only £3.95).  The salmon was tasty with the lobster sauce but I was let down by the food's temperature, as if it had been left on the side for a bit before serving it.  Other than that, decent candle lit place with many tables cramped in a small-ish area but you will be surprised when you realize it is actually a three storey building.",-1
5,"Le Mercury is a great cheap and chic French restaurant situated on Upper Street. The prices really are unbelievable with starters beginning at just £3.95, mains at £6.50 and deserts at £2.95.
The crab and lobster ravioli or the calamari are two of my favourite starters although it is is difficult to choose from such a wide selection
It has a romantic feel and is certainly an ideal place for a date with food that is impressive but prices that won't break the bank. From the outside the dimmed lighting and minimalistic decor gives the impression of Le Mercury being an expensive snooty restaurant but it certainly is not.
Another great thing about Le Mercury is the very fast service- an added bonus when you're feeling hungry and watch the other diners tucking into their delicious meals.",1
4,"This French restaurant has a wonderful philosophy of quick service, excellent food and at very reasonable rates. Its no wonder that its always packed - but you don't have to wait long for a table. The steak was the best I've had in a while, soft and tender with a shallot sauce. At only 6.50 pounds, it was an absolute bargain! Starters are also very good, and around 4 pounds each. A bottle of wine is pretty reasonable at 10.50 as well. 
The restaurant gives the atmosphere of an intimate high end eatery, and the dim lighting and soft candles save it from looking like a bistro. This is a perfect place to go for a pre-theater or cinema meal, as the fast service won't keep you waiting long for a great meal. The Creme Brulee is still a simple favorite that is on the menu. Have with an espresso for the perfect meal!",1
4,"Le Mercury is a real gem. It's not very fancy, but it has loads of atmosphere with the lighting provided by candles in wine bottles and street lights coming through the windows. Things can get packed in pretty tight, so it's best to make a booking (even on a Monday night at 8pm we wouldn't have been able to get a table if we hadn't already reserved one).
 The food is quite good, even if the menu isn't terribly extensive. My sea bass was fantastic, nice a crispy on the outside but really moist on the inside. Their desserts are really nice too, but don't expect anything on the lighter side. But the portions are perfect, just enough to leave you feeling satisfied without feeling stuffed. And things are relatively cheap with three courses costing only about £15 (excluding drinks).
 It's a really good late night spot as well; they're open til 2, and they won't rush you if you want to sit around and chat after your meal. It can get a bit noisy in there, but still a good place to bring friends.",1
3,"Adequate French restaurant in Angel. There are many to choose from but if you want something cheap then this is ok. You do get what you pay for though.
 On the standard menu starters are £3.95, mains £6.95 and desert £2.95. There are always specials as well with prices going up to £10. Salmon was nice, steak was gross.
 Service was prompt but disinterested & I wouldn't return. I did in fact leave without leaving a tip because our waiter gave a bit of a mad serial killer impression.",-1
4,Great food and service is also good... decor a little drab these days.. still a favourite of mine though,1
4,"I really like this restaurant. My boss put me on to it a couple of years back, and I have been numerous times since.
 The combination of good value with high quality food and a nice location / layout really make this worth going to.
 The menu is always varied and changes frequently. As I said, the great value makes it even better. You don't get massive portions, but more than enough to do the job. There is always a specials menu (no, not just the leftovers) which has some stunning dishes. Haven't had a bad dish yet!
 There are a few French restaurants in Angel, this being my second favourite. A very close second, mind",1
5,"My favourite little restaurant in Islington. I almost want to be selfish and pretend I hate it so that it doesn't get any busier! But in the spirit of paying it forward - GO TO THE MERCURY!! 
It does get very busy so make sure you ring ahead.
Anyway, the food is unbelievably delicious, which is exacerbated by the excellent prices and good sized portions. I cannot say enough to recommend this restaurant. The candle light and the warm atmosphere all add that little extra special something.
I remember the lamb main course being particularly yummy, but the menu keeps changing and I haven't had a bad experience yet.",1
4,"I went here with a french person and apparently it is incredibly authentic. The food was lovely (steak cooked to perfection) as was the wine. No problems with the service.
 It's in a very busy area so you will be lucky to find a seat, I definately recommend booking in advance.",1
4,"I'm just going to second what everyone else is saying.  This place is cheap, and the food is good.  I'm not expecting food cooked to level of a good Parisian bistro, but for how much you have to pay, this place is amazing.  Gets super packed though, so make reservations at least a few days in advance.",1
4,"Very unpretentious little place along Upper street. We casually popped in one evening. We had to wait a while, as the place was full and apparently, you are advised to make reservations. Considering the price level, my expecations were low, but I was positively overwhelmed. They keep a simple menu, reproduced in high volume, which is probably the recipe for success. Its not a top class French restaurant, but it is extremely good value for money.",1
4,"Reasonable priced, quick service, nice atmosphere, decent food.  Within their price range, I cannot expect anything better.  All the tables have candles, the windows are lined with plants and other decorations.  The food wasn't anything amazing but you can tell some care went into the preparation and it surpassed expectations",1
3,"I sit down and am promptly ignored until Meg comes in. The vibe is very French bistro and a bit like Lucien in NYC which used to be our favourite place for a mildly celebratory dinner so that's good. The restaurant is crowded but unlike a crowded NYC restaurant you aren't putting your elbows in your neighbour's soup.
 Tiny paper napkins and diner-standard flatware/glasses are all that's on the table. Meg arrives, we get the menus, and order drinks. We get glasses of tap water, which are never refilled, and a bottle of chenin blanc which turns out to be a 2008 from Long Beach winery in South Africa. This is a little sweet, but very nice - I like it a lot. The bread is pretty plain-jane white bread, but it has poppy seeds on the outside which make it better than expected.
 Meg has Tian au Crabe which is described on the menu as Tian of crab and avocado emulsion. What is a tian? We don't know which seems as good a reason as any to order it. It turns out to be something like crab salad. Meg seems to enjoy it.
 I have Chevre Chaud, grilled goat's cheese with fresh leaf salad and basil pesto. This is quite good although I think rather too heavy on the goat cheese and not heavy enough on the pesto as it's a little dry. The salad is nothing special and in fact I was hoping for more leaves. Weirdly, I guess, I'm asking for them to have more of the cheap ingredients in this dish.
 For mains, Meg gets Supreme de Poulet Roti - roast breast of chicken, garlic mash, green peppercorn. She seems to like it. I have Filet de Loup de Mer - sea bass with cauliflower puree, raisins, and chili lemon zest. Everything individually is good but they don't seem to go together that well.
 And that's it. We're tired, Meg seems to be coming down with something, so we skip out after just over an hour for under 40GBP. A great deal, convenient, decent food. We'll definitely be back.",-1
5,"Had passed this place a lot and never got around to calling in until one night when 6 of us decided to go for food and every where was absolutely packed out around here. With empty grumbling bellys we made it to a really busy looking La Mercury and luckily were able to get a table upstairs. We couldn't believe how cheap the food was, we got a set meal and the food was stunning. We were all well impressed and would definately head back soon.",1
4,"You really can't fault Le Mercury for what it is. All starters are the same low price. All entrees are the same low price. And yes, all desserts are same low price as well. It's incredibly cheap, yet still tasty. Probably the best value for money you can find in the area. It does get quite crowded though, so call ahead and make a reservation. And also be prepared for it to be a tad noisy on the weekends, but certainly not overwhelming.",1
5,"This is a friendly and inexpensive French eatrie perched on the corner of Upper St and Almeida street.In my opinion it has carved a good niche for itself in a market where there are hordes of over-priced and over-rated restaurants. The management has particularly laid back attitude towards customers and the food is inexpensive. Starters cost around 3.95 and main course around 6.45. A starter of gnocchi with butternut squash was light and delicious,the steak and chips was cooked just to right level and the banana shortcake with strawberries completed the meal nicely. It has pictures of Paris all over the walls and lit by candle light stuck in arty bottles.",1
5,"Cannot recommend this place enough! Food... delicious. The staff was SO kind and helpful, it was clear they wanted us to enjoy ourselves and our food. We weren't sure what we wanted to order so they helped us each make decisions based on what we have liked in the past. I loved the butter chicken, two in our group got vegetarian dishes and loved them as well. The portions were also the perfect size, not too much and not too little.
As a side note, you should read the fine print on the menu, it had us cracking up. Start with reading the details under Garlic Naan.",1
2,"Anurag was super excited about this place, having seen it on Andrew Zimmerman. I honestly really wanted to like this place. The place is very small and cramped, and the service was pretty poor. Even in the tiny place, the server didn't make eye contact and we had to flag him down several times. When the server did make his way to us, he was very bent on overselling dishes to us and had us over order, honestly. 
The food was very average. Other than the kaddu poori, which made me think about home (which was something we grew up eating), everything else was sub par. The naan/ roti was too hard and the Kadhai chicken was not great The daal was also very bland.
I don't know if we came at an off time, but our experience was sub par and I won't recommend it/ come back again.",-1
4,"I'm not going to lie, British food proper isn't much to write home about, but they've been smart enough to bring the best that the Empire had to offer back to London, and Punjab is a case in point. We were there pretty early (maybe 6ish?) on a random Tuesday, and had no issues getting a table for two as walk-ins, but they were steadily busy so your mileage may vary. 
Service was proper; friendly enough and efficient, and both our beverages and our food came out remarkably quickly. Additionally, we had no issues getting the check when we were ready to depart, which is a change of pace from most of continental Europe.
My colleague's Butter Chicken was excellent; flavorful and a touch spicy (or perhaps I've been eating bland German food for too long). Definitely a solid choice. However, we both agreed that the Pudina Ghosht (a mint lamb curry) was the real winner of the meal. I don't think I've ever had a mint curry before, and I'd order it again in a heartbeat. Spicy and packed with herbal flavors, but without the sometimes overpowering richness that comes from some of the more common curries (at least those that are common in the US). Absolutely fantastic!
One tip: the meals don't generally come with rice or naan, so make sure to order a side of them if you want them!",1
5,"This place was amazing. This place was mentioned by guy fieti on a tv show, I'm glad I stopped by. Excellent service, amazing food, great prices. I suggest getting the garlic naan with whatever you order. Don't be afraid of the spicy dishes, they are manageable. I will come back here next time I'm in London.",1
4,Pujab has a separate menu for vegans and vegetarians to leverage when ordering. I ordered the gobi aloo with roti and really liked my dish overall. The cauliflower and potatoes were cooked and flavored very well. My only gripe is that I asked for my food to be cooked extra spicy and I felt like my entree was not spicy at all--huge let down. They brought some little peppers over so that I could eat them with my dish but I prefer spice to be cooked into my meal. I recommend they spice dishes they way their customers ask going forward.,1
5,"Walk-ins seated via party size with larger parties seated first
Owner is out front, very charming
Service is fast, quick turnaround so the line goes fast
Extremely effecient service - they didn't get it wrong, it was probably you. ;)
Light takes on the heavy items were used to in the US.
Meats cooked very well-being even white meats came out tender
Nice sized portions. We were able to finish without being overly full
Interesting mix between friendly and brusquely efficient
Delicious flavors
Highly recommend
Wish we could've stayed for dessert",1
5,"This place was much better than the other Indian restaurant we visited.   The chicken curry, curried lamb, and naan very very flavorful.  The service was impeccable.  On my list for when we return!",1
4,"I LOVE Indian food and eat it almost weekly, so was excited to try some tikka masala in England. Came here since it seemed to be authentic and at a good price.
The service was great. Very prompt and accommodating. We started with samosas with a great dipping sauce.
We followed with the chicken tikka masala, mixed grill and garlic naan. I asked for the chicken tikka masala a touch under ""Indian spicy"" which is how I normally order it in the US (a 10 Indian spicy usually knocks me out haha!) Not sure if they assumed we couldn't handle their spice level because we are not Indian and from the US, but it was not spicy AT ALL. My boyfriends mixed grill was good, but he also requested a side of spicy tikka masala sauce and it was again not spicy at all. They quickly gave him a spicier sauce, madras, which was better, but still not nearly the spice we are used too.
To be clear, the food at its core is good!! However, we have found at many different types of restaurants in London that the spice level is just not what we are used to in the US. If you are an American craving spice, would just recommend asking for a much higher spice level here and really most places in London.",1
4,"Punjab has created this Indian food Monster in me. I recently stop by their location in Covent Garden while on a trip in London and Oh my Gosh! 
It is a bit in the upper price but well worth for the quality of the ingredients, efficient service and definitely the location. 
We had the Lam Biryani £14.50 ($19), Saag Paneer £7.95 ($11), Chicken Tikka Masala £11.75 ($15.50), and Tandoori Lamb Seek Kebab £12 ($16) and obviously a serious overload of Naan bread £2.50 ($4)! 
Every dish was excellent, perfect mild spice to it. Creamy Saag Paneer and Tikka Masala. 
All these dishes just went perfectly with each other. 
And what would Indian food be without Raita?? It was so creamy, and fresh! 
Hopefully it is not too far away my next trip to UK so I can definitely touch heaven again!! 
Cheers!",1
4,"Punjab is located on Neal St at Convert Garden area.  It's one of oldest Indian restaurant in London.  
We came here for lunch and arrived 5 mins before they opened.  However, there were few groups of people waiting in line.
We ordered more than enough for our last day lunch in London coz we really enjoyed authentic Indian cuisine in London.  
Samosas - It was just ok and taste didn't like fresh made. 
Naan - We liked it the sliced garlic on naan. 
Gobi Aloo - Cauliflower and potatoes lightly spiced and sautéed, it's good.
Chicken tandoori - Roasted chicken marinated in fresh yogurt and tandoori masala.  Chicken quite tender and moist, so delicious. 
King Prawn Bhuna - Jumbo prawns curry was excellent and just made us fell in love with curry.....
Overall, decent service and very reasonable price.  I would recommend to visitors (like us) and like to try causal Indian food.",1
3,"The restaurant was recommended by a friend and when we arrived it was packed. Fortunately, we were able to find a table for 2. I looked for recommended items on the menu and ended up ordering the butter chicken-a Punjabi speciality. Well, when it arrived I took my first bite and  it was insanely spicy. To the managers credit he saw the face I made after that first bit and asked me if anything was wrong. I told him it was very very spicy. He then had the waiter bring me some yogurt to calm the spices down. if you love spice this is your dish. If not, stay away from it.",-1
4,"Good service, food is satisfying. I really wish they had traditional chai. The place is very conjugated. 
Serviceman are attentive but at times I feel rushed by them",1
5,"Showed up without a reservation on a Thursday night.  Only had to wait a few minutes for a table for one, despite being a small line.  Ordered the Chicken Madras, garlic naan, and a Cobra beer.  Food was out in minutes.  Too hot to eat!  Chicken was spicy, and the naan awesome.  Both of those combined with a beer...AWESOME!  If you are seeing a show, and need a quick place to eat, this is it.   All around awesome!",1
5,Excellent vegan options. They offer a separate vegan menu from which I ordered gobi aloo with rice and samosa. Delicious!,1
4,"Located in beautiful Covent Garden (aka the theatre district of London), Punjab remains true to its authenticity. Open since 1945, It's apparently the oldest North Indian restaurant in London. The decor inside is traditional with purple as it's predominant color. The seating is a bit cramped in here, as tables are quite close to each other. The food here is great. My family and I got the mango lassi, saag paneer, naan, tandoori chicken, lamb madras, and chicken madras. 
The mango lassi was creamy and fragrant. But, I still think it doesn't even compare to the mango lassi in Singapore, which was mind blowing. The saag paneer was less creamy compared to one I usually eat in Houston at Naseeb. But, I did appreciate the spinach flavor that's more predominant at Punjab. The tandoori chicken had a nice grilled flavor and was moist. It went well with their naan bread. Now, the best dish on their menu by far was their lamb or chicken madras. Strong curry flavor and spicy as hell! Thank goodness we had enough rice to calm the spice. I would definitely recommend eating this. 
I can't wait to come back to this restaurant whenever I visit London again. It would be a wonderful dinner choice before a theatre show close by. I'm sad I missed the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play that was currently playing nearby when we were there.",1
5,The was the ONLY restaurant that was a repeat from our previous London trip.  We have been daydreaming about coming back since our first London trip 9 years ago. Reasonable price with fast and friendly service.  I wish I can have the naan bread and the chicken tika marsala again right now. I also appreciate how it's bright light inside so I can see and take pictures of my food.  The couple next to us both ordered a sizzling plate and it smelled great too! Will definitely come back if I'm lucky to visit London again.,1
3,"Decent, best way to describe it. Service was good. But was initially a bit spotty. The food was average. Just average. Disappointed as I was told London was the place to eat Indian food. I am also fairly picky about my Indian cuisine and was so surprised at how average my food tasted. Oh well.",-1
5,Amazing food and service- loved the EVERYTHING and worth any wait there is- right near covent garden- wow!,1
5,"One of the best if not the best Indian meal
I have had. The shrimp tandoori were out of this world. #londonturist",1
2,"I came here because of a recommendation from a friend in Los Angeles and thought my tastebuds were in for Nirvana.  The line out the door was a good sign, but sadly my hopes of finding Nirvana at Punjab was not so. I came here a couple times during my last trip to London hoping things would get better.  I did meet some nice people who shared a few of their dishes with me so I was able to taste more than I would have by myself - that's always nice!  There are some good things, but mostly I left with a poor taste in my mouth and bitterness in my heart. 
The service was consistently fair to middlen. Anytime someone comes to take your full order without suggesting appetizers or beverages it makes me feel like they want you in and out as fast as possible. Is this a fast-food joint?  No?  Then let me try to enjoy the experience you have to offer. 
I asked the server for suggestions since every chef has their specialty, but I didn't get any. ""Whatever you feel like"" doesn't sit well with me.
On my second and third visits I ordered different appetizers.  Each were very hot, tasty, fresh and perfectly seasoned with dipping sauce that add the right amount of ""kick-ass"" to your tastebuds.  The stuffed eggplant didn't seem to be stuffed with much of anything (it was cut down the middle and roasted), but I could eat roasted eggplant any day of the week and be perfectly content. 
The chicken Korma was like puréed baby food without any of the flavor or spices you might expect. No cashews, raisins, or any other seasonings you'd normally latch onto to please your palate.  Such a disappointing dish. They wouldn't let me order it ""spicy.""  I was also told that people have nut allergies, so I guess I can't have nuts at Punjab either!  I realize there are different styles of cooking, especially when it comes to south Asian cuisine, but I didn't enjoy the bland nature of this dish which I generally love and call ""my favorite"" at other restaurants. 
Here is what upset me the most and left bitterness in my heart:  I had already experienced different dishes throughout my stay in London at Punjab with a variety of meats, but on my last night I ordered a different chicken dish (my cardiologist would like this).  When I tasted the dish my tastebuds said ""baa baa baa"" and not ""cluck cluck cluck.""  It was lamb, again. I love lamb so I ate it anyhow and didn't complain, but as I was leaving the restaurant one of the owners said, ""I saw that you ordered chicken, but I switched it to lamb because lamb is better.""  I don't mind a prefix menu if that's what I'm ordering, but intentionally changing my order and NOT telling me is WRONG. If you want me to try something different, then give me a taste and don't force your opinions on me.  I was consistently asking the servers for suggestions and they wouldn't give me any!  I already had plenty of lamb at Punjab and wasn't in the mood for more, but I ate it, again. 
How would you feel if you ordered a cucumber sandwich and the chef said, ""I saw you ordered a cucumber sandwich, but what you really wanted was a BLT so I changed it...oh, and you're still paying me for it.""  
I'm generous with two stars.",-1
4,"As tourist at London, we wanted to taste authentic Indian cuisine since all my good friends told me that the Indian food in London is better than that of native food at India. When we stopped at Trafalgar Square which is 10 minuets walk to the restaurant, it's time to try this one. The lamb biryani was very good, chicken tikka masala was good too, less tasteful than I expected, curry lamb was tender and tasty. Decent quality and portion. The service was fast and courteous, environment was casual.",1
4,"Some might erroneously call me unadventurous for never straying from my order of chicken tikka masala at an Indian restaurant. Others might correctly recognize that I simply wanted to honor ""a true British national dish"" (shout out to you, former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook) in one of the world's most multicultural cities.
Dishoom is definitely the more popular Indian restaurant in London, but I didn't want to risk having to wait for a table. Punjab fit the bill perfectly. We were promptly seated and ordered chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, garlic naan, and rice. The garlic naan was so good that it has now ruined all other kinds of naan for me. Both of our curry dishes included succulent, juicy chicken. While the butter chicken was extremely flavorful, I wish we would've gotten a vegetable dish instead because it started tasting a little repetitive. 
If you're torn between Punjab and the Dishoom in Covent Garden a few blocks from Leicester Square (even if you're already in line for Dishoom), don't hesitate to give Punjab a try. The decor here looks a bit traditional and outdated compared to Dishoom's trendy atmosphere, but you can't go wrong with the curry at Punjab.",1
4,This was reputed to be the best Indian food in London but I don't think it is. Interesting photography on the wall - enough to give it one more star. It was good but not great. It's in the West End and a fun location. I'm waiting for a truly great Indian food in England. Any suggestions?,1
2,I LOVE Indian food and was excited to try this restaurant. I always order Chicken Tikka Masala at new places so that I can find out how it ranks to my favorite places. The dish was not very good so unfortunately I will not be back!,-1
4,"Must try Gazar Halwa!
For an Indian and especially Punjabi, this is definitely a historic place. First Indian restaurant in London. Authentic old era building feeling and beautiful neighborhood. In SOHO close to oxford st, and many other London attractions
No long wait times even on Saturday. Welcoming staff and interior with history. Nice clean and good presentation. Good music and not loud.
Probably not good for kids as space is little congested.
Ordered Chana masala, dal makhani, tandoori roti and gazar halwa
Ratings
Chana Masala 4.5 I hope it was slightly less tangy. Good balance of spices
Dal Makhani 4 Spices delicately balanced but I felt some Masala was missing maybe because couldn't taste ginger and garlic.
Tandoor Roti 4 was not crispy
Gazar Halwa 5 SUPER DELICIOUS
Service 5
Overall 4
They accept AmEX (not a big deal but important for business travelers)",1
5,"We arrived for dinner about 5:30 pm on a Saturday after taking in a 2:30 show in West End. The place was already busy but we were seated promptly. It filled up shortly after we arrived. We selected Punjab because it was highly rated on Yelp and once again Yelp was right!!
I don't eat a lot of Indian food, but this is the best I can remember. Our amazing appetizer was Kandu Puru, the pumpkin bread. Our courses were Acharri Murgha (chicken curry) and Methi Gosht (lamb curry). Both were exceptionally prepared, tender meats and truly delicious sauces. We accompanied it with cheers naan which was also delicious. My favorite of the dishes was the chicken curry. The menu states ""has to be experienced once in a lifetime"" and I'm glad I experienced it!
Service was fast and extremely friendly and attentive. Highly recommend!!",1
3,"We were looking to go to Dishoom, but the darned place always had a 90 minute wait, and I wasn't planning on standing in a line outside in the cold weather (yes, that's what they make you do in many of the  UK restaurants!), so we came here. 
Even though we were here at 9:30P on a Thursday night there was still a 10-15 min wait. The service was generally very friendly, especially the hosts. 
The food was a bit of a hit/miss. Excellent butter chicken and Chole, and pretty good tandoori chicken. Very mediocre lamb biryani. Lots of meat but the flavor wasn't particularly good. Chicken tikka masala was okay and the naan was ok.",-1
3,"Our experience was not a bad one... but when you're eating Indian in London man do you have a lot of competition so at this point the food needs to be damn good in order to have a high rating. The service was very good and the wait was not too long on a Saturday evening- maybe 15 minutes. 
Samosas were alright (I feel bitchy saying meh), and the prawn puri and king prawn bunha were also ok. They were slightly disappointing from flavour and temperature. Keep in mind that I've become snobbish when it comes to Indian food in London at this point. I did, however, love the cheesy naan. It's a very subtle light cheese inside the naan and adds a beautiful creamy and fluffiness. It's a nice Indian restaurant in a very good location but you can find much better (and much worse) elsewhere.",-1
5,"Had a wonderful meal here on a stopover in London. It was recommended by a friend and I'm so glad we stopped in! Very easy location and excellent staff who were very attentive but laid back to let you eat as well. Kid friendly too!
The pakora were crispy and wonderful. My husband had a chicken dish that came in a sizzling fajita like platter that was pretty awesome and I had the chole which was just enough spice and super flavourful. It wasn't spicy to cover up blandness but just enhanced all the ingredients. 
We overheard another couple talking about gluten-free options and they were being more than accommodating which is great to hear. Reasonably priced too, we defintely will consider visiting again next time we are in London.",1
5,Great food and service.  Their menu has some bold font items that are specialties.  They are awesome!  Affordable food. Popular and a good location. Happy we made this stop!!!,1
4,"The food is delicious especially their bullet Naan 
I enjoyed the malai kofta more than the paneer entree! While The Samosas were good!",1
5,"My family and I were in London for the first time in March. Did you know the national dish of England is Chicken Tikka Masala? It's a long story, but google it sometime. So, we had to order just that with some curry as well. They were fantastic as were the appetizers and side sauces. They even served us a complimentary sparkly dessert custard! Everything was delicious and the staff were so nice. Quick services too!",1
5,Amazing cuisine and even better service. Chicken Tikka Masala and Acharri Ghost was fantastic. Make sure you get the Bullet Naan if you're into spice. Santana is the best!,1
4,"Punjab was great! There was a line to get in and we were seated very quickly. Good selection of traditional Indian food and beers. We had the Paneer Pakora to start which we didn't love but it was still nice, think pakora generally goes better with a lighter batter. The aloo gobi was amazing, perfectly spicy and lots of flavour! The Tikka Masala tased awesome but not as creamy as usually get more like a tomato curry than creamy tikka masala. Overall the service was great and really enjoyed our food!",1
4,"I had thd samosa and chicken curry.  It was delicious along witn indian beer.  Servers were very friendly Prices are fair. The restaurant itself could use some updating, thus not a 5 star review.",1
5,Awesome. We tried another restaurant that had super long lines. We happened to be walking by some locals who said that line is ridiculous. Especially since the food is better. We walked with them and were very happy we did.,1
5,"Ok I first have to say that this review is 1 year old lol. That alone should tell you how much I loved this restaurant, I still think about it all the time! I went to this restaurant last year when visiting London and out of my whole trip my absolute favorite meal was eaten here!!! Their butter chicken!!! It was so delicious I cannot speak highly enough about it! Peshwari naan did not disappoint either. And the mango lassi! Everything was so amazing I seriously enjoyed it so much!! If I am ever in London again this is a MUST go. Service and decor were great as well. Love this restaurant so much and wish they had one in California!",1
4,"Tried to get into dishoom but was 2.5 hr wait.  This was a great 2nd choice.  Just 10min wait, food was great as was the service.",1
4,"This review is a bit dated but ended up coming here again for my second trip.  The inside is very clean and gives a sense of coziness. You can easily tell that many locals come to this location and for good reason. The staff are very pleasant and the food was okay but just what I needed. I wished it had a bit more spice to the Chicken Tikka and Jalfrezi but that's possibly due to me comparing what I eat back home in Los Angeles. Overall, it was a pleasant experience.",1
5,"Walked over to Punjab absolutely starving after trying to check out another restaurant in the area and I'm so glad we did. Walked in and we were warmly greeted by the team at the door and also saw there was a great variation of ethnicities as far as diners which is a good indication that this was going to be a great experience. 
One of the guys came over, took my friend's jacket and placed it on the chair - truly gentleman move right there and asked if we needed some suggestions for a great meal. We asked for time to review the menu, made our selections and anxiously anticipated our food to come. Out first, they bring you a gratuitous aperitif - a thin and crispy flatbread with four salsas/salads - mango puree, onion/tomato/cucumber diced salad, this delish apple/mint chutney mix and some type of spicy pickles I think (forgot to try that though). 
We ordered an app of ground lamb and lentils formed into patties and OMG - this is patty heaven! The rest of the meal consisted of saag paneer And chicken tika masala - all absolutely divine! My soul says too bad I dont live here but my waistline is grateful! Excellent job all around!",1
2,"We came to this restaurant after reading Yelp reviews. Arrived at about 6:30pm, one party ahead of us. Despite seeing several open tables we were told to wait, and took about 20 minutes to seat the 3 of us. The ambience was good, and the food aroma was inviting. We ordered buttered chicken which consisted of two medium sized pieces of chicken that was covered with the yellow spiced curry, but dry on the inside. We also ordered the goat tandoori which came in 4 kebabs, well seasoned but very salty. Also ordered buttered naan and sweet naan, both just okay. The service was definitely a low light, had to ask for water 3 times, and they never came by to refill. The bill came quickly though, and surprised to find they already added tip. Overall not impressed with the food, bad service, definitely not recommended and would not come back.",-1
5,"I knew while I was in London that I had to eat some Indian food. After spending a full day at Warner Brothers Studio we went to Yelp for suggestions. Punjab had the highest stars with the most reviews, most places had under 50. We arrived around 7:30-8p on a Monday night and the restaurant was fairly crowded. We put our names in and waited about 10 minutes before being seated. Our waiter was friendly and personable, he made suggestions that we gladly took. 
We ordered:  Tikka Masala, butter chicken, saag paneer, gobi aloo, and acharri gosht lamb, cheese naan and rice. We definitely ordered too much food. My friend also ordered samosas as an appetizer for herself. 
Samosas: my friend loved them, they were hearty and the pastry they were cooked in had just the right amount of flaky texture to it. She wasn't a fan of the mint chutney she ordered with them and I tasted it and was also underwhelmed. 
Tikka masala: delicious. The chicken was juicy and tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I wish it had a little bit more spice 
Butter chicken: the sauce was AMAZING. I couldn't stop dipping the naan in it. It was the right amount of spice and so flavorful. The chicken also was cooked wonderfully and fell off the bone. 
Lamb dish: delicious. Flavorful and juicy. I only had a small amount of this but my friend was in love. 
Saag paneer: was good, not great. Would probably pass on this dish if I came again. 
Gobi aloo: my boyfriend loved it. I didn't try any. He said it was the best he's had. 
Cheese naan: cheese and bread are the perfect pairing. This didn't disappoint. 
The flavors of the food and the service definitely makes me want to visit this restaurant again if I'm ever in London. It's the oldest Indian food restaurant in the city!",1
5,Great food and ambiance in a very busy street with lots of choices. Recommend stopping here first,1
5,"Awesome atmosphere. Quick wait outside. They keep things moving. Very clean, and great attention to detail. Food was excellent. Highly recommend",1
3,"Had lunch with my husband at Punjab today...
Ambiance was nice enough and the restaurant was about 1/3 full on a Wednesday afternoon at 2pm.
Service isn't friendly AT ALL ... not sure why? 
Food was pretty good but the biggest problem was that the spice level was pretty intense. If my mouth hadn't been on fire the whole time I was eating I surely would have enjoyed the chole, the bhindi, and the aloo gobi much more. The rice and naan were good (no spice obviously).
Prices are quite reasonable.
Overall I just wish the food wasn't so spicy! If we could somehow get mild food we'd definitely return.",-1
5,"Simply amazing. Cannot say enough good things about quite possibly the best meal, and hands down the best Indian cuisine I have ever tasted.
We ordered off the vegetarian menu. The paneer and dhal lentils were to die for. Our group left nothing to spare - it was all so good.
Our servers were attentive and hospitable (amazing!) and our group was even able to chat with the owner before we were seated, and as we were leaving. A very nice man with a lot to be proud of! 
I will remember this meal forever. Thank you Punjab!",1
5,"What a great place! We are visiting from Los Angeles, and saw results on Yelp. We knew we had to have curry at some point during our trip, and we weren't disappointed. 
Even without reservations, we were quickly ushered to a table and food came our perfectly -- savory, flavorful, and delicious! We ordered the pumpkin on bread, butter chicken (savory as it should be , not sweet), methi gosht (might not be spelling this correctly!), bullet naan (garlic and chilis! Heaven!!), aloo paratha, and butter naan. This was enough for dinner and some leftovers for tomorrow :) Besides that, the owner and staff are wonderful -- friendly and good-natured. 
Definitely recommend this place!",1
5,Really delicious authentic Indian food. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of cuisine. And I will visit any time I'm in London.,1
5,"Excellent Indian food in London.  One of our children does not like Indian food. But even she greatly enjoyed the lentils, samosas, and other items. We had a blast at this nice restaurant.",1
1,"Overpriced. Below average food. The taste is blended.
Not very attentive service, server seemed annoyed after couple questions about the menu from us.
Seems a lot of people come here for pre show dinner only, most of them finished meal really fast.
One positive star is their interior design is quite nice.",-1
4,"Punjab has been highly recommended by so many travel articles including Condé Nast Traveler. So naturally I had to try this place out! My sister and I absolutely loved their delicious, fragrant dishes. My favorite dishes were their Chicken Tikka Masala and Grandad's Kali Daal! These dishes were so powerful in flavor. You won't be disappointed with these two! Service was excellent. Would recommend this place to anyone visiting London! Can't wait to come back!",1
5,We loved Punjab!! The food was excellent and service was fast and very friendly. We had the Acharri Gosht and loved it!,1
5,"Had the itch for some Indian food, after searching for a few in the London area, I found this. I made my way from the hotel which was a quick 10 minutes via Uber, arrived and was quickly seated.
The waiter took my order, I ordered a plate that I will do it some justice and won't even attempt to name it because I asked the waiter for something he would recommend and I believe it was curry lamb. I told me what the name of the plate was but I'll be honest, it flew past my head, all I know is that the plate came with naan, some rice, and the lamb in some orange curry sauce.
I loved it, the food was really good, the service quick and the cost wasn't too bad, for dessert I had some mango kulfi which was also delicious.",1
5,"My wife and I have a tradition where we go to the Punjab before going to see a West End show. We get here at 6, and we leave with plenty of time to get to the theatre before curtain up.
The food is always great, and the staff are extremely welcoming. It's no wonder this in the the UK's oldest North Indian restaurant.",1
4,"After walking around London by myself for hours, I stopped in at Punjab for lunch. The staff was polite and prompt, and the food was delicious. I got the acharri gosht (lamb curry) with garlic naan. The naan was thinner than what I'm used to, but whatever. The location is nice too--lots of shops nearby and close to the British Museum.",1
4,"This was a really great restaurant. They only take a handful of reservations ahead of time, but when I called they said that 50% of their tables are available for walk ins. We arrived on a Thursday and got in within a few mins. The food was sooooooo yummy. Loved the vegetable kofta and chicken tikka masala. The dal was very good too and the garlic naan made things really complete. The service was attentive and kept things going. Would highly recommend coming here for quality Indian eats!",1
5,Holy smoke this place crazy good. Top notch INDIAN right in the middle of the theatre district. You gotta go!,1
5,"Fab Punjabi food I loved the food and service and hospitality my first visit to London from California 
Great owner, his name is Amrit , fantastic personal touch",1
5,"The food was amazing! Excellent customer service. 
Authentic Quality.  Really enjoyed the environment.",1
5,"I saw this restaurant on one of Guy Fieri's show and have been wanting to visit for a while. It was such a pleasant experience! The staff was great and attentive but not over the top. The food speaks for itself! The chicken tikka masala was so flavorful and the chicken was so tender. The samosas were crispy on the outside and jam packed with goodness inside - a bit on the spicy side, so be careful if you're not into spicy food. The lamb shami kebab was on point! The accompanying sauce was minty and citrusy all at once and really brought out the flavors of the lamb patties. 
I'll be dreaming of this place for years to come!",1
5,"AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS FOOD! I happened to come across this place whilst on a walking tour of London and I'm very glad I did as it did not disappoint! The chicken tikka masala has moist, tender cuts of chicken in a delicious and not overly greasy curry sauce. The garlic naan was in fact coated with just the right amount of garlic flavoring and was not burnt or overly crisp. The mango lassi which I also tried was also delicious and not too sweet. Every item I tried was on point! Also, the staff was friendly and attentive! I would definitely come back the next time I'm in London!",1
5,"This was such a delicious meal! We popped in on our way to see Matilda. We had the bullet naan (pretty spicy), chicken biryani, samosas, and a fried fish appetizer that I can't remember the name of. Yum!",1
4,"Really delicious Punjabi Indian food in London! On my one week trip to London this past week we looked for Indian food since we heard that it's your best bet at good food in London (otherwise notorious for having shitty food).
The restaurant itself was packed on a Friday night around 8pm, but luckily there was barely any wait (10 min or so). I ordered the Lamb Madras since it was the only item under lamb labeled ""hot/spicy"". It was SUCH tender lamb - I was actually surprised but it may be the most tender lamb I've had at any Indian restaurant. The sauce was spicy enough, 7/10 on my spicy level scale (I love spicy food for reference). The curry flavor was really yummy, packed with just enough spices for that kick. My friend ordered one of their tandoori chicken dishes and I was equally surprised by how juicy the chicken pieces were (they didn't come with bone, so that's even more surprising). They poured a shot of (alcohol) on her chicken tandoori sizzling plate and lit it up with a match - the fire was HUGE so be wary of your hair! The mango lassi drink was perfect and not too sweet. The only letdown was the appetizer - we ordered the prawn puri and it came with SUCH tiny shrimp (def not prawn....). Skip that appetizer!
Overall - food was delicious, portions a bit small for the price (approx 20 pounds per person) as we had no leftovers. I'm usually almost always left with leftovers at Indian restaurants in the States...
If I'm back in London I'll be sure to visit Punjab again :)",1
2,"For the prices we expected high quality. If not from the food at least from the service. However, our main waiter was rude and made us feel like he might spit in our food. The samosas were greasy and lacking flavor, the paneer pakora had been sitting in it's old greese and then reheated. Then the main course arrived and the rice was soggy, which is a sure sign of a bad Indian restaurant.  The kitchen should never have allowed it to come out. We had a Dahl and chickpea curry.  The chickpea curry was good but the dahl was barley editable. Had this been a 20 pound meal we still would have been disappointed but at 60 pounds it was offensive.",-1
5,"What I Ordered: Chicken Tikka Masala, Saag Paneer, Samosas and Naan
Flavor: This was probably the best Chicken Tikka Masala I've ever had.  I've heard this is one of, if not the first place to serve the dish so if you come here, definitely get that.
Service:  Pretty attentive.
Atmosphere: Nice traditional old school Indian restaurant decor and music.
Price: Good for the quality.
Location: Great location.  In walking distance from the West End and Picadilly Circus.  So a nice pre-show meal if you plan on seeing any plays.
Other Comments:  I would definitely come back here.",1
5,"I went here on my only night free in London based on other yelp reviews, and was not disappointed. I do not normally seek out Indian food on my trips, but the reviews were fantastic and again it did not disappoint. I wish I could tell you what me and my guest ordered, but we ordered a lamb curry dish and a chicken curry dish based on the suggestion of the waiter or manager. We had naan bread, and white rice, and the local beers Again, I wish I could say more about the dishes other than the spices were perfect, medium was just right, and the atmosphere was fantastic. It felt very much like a local, cozy place to eat for locals. I would highly recommend to anyone..",1
5,"If I could I would give them 20 stars.
The food the service is great here.
Nothing goes wrong feel free to order whatever you like. The spicy naan was my favorite. Chicken beryani was outstanding.
I would go back again when I am back in London.",1
4,"This is the first Indian restaurant in London's history. The menu is quite extensive and there are some unique items that aren't found in majority of restaurants. The food was quite good, but after going to Dishoom a few nights before I felt this restaurant was a bit of a let down based on the standards of Dishoom. The owners and staff were very helpful and took time to talk to us.",1
4,This is an awesome place to get Indian food when you're in London. Very home style cooking. Usually not too long a wait to get a table. Not a fancy place. The naan wasn't great but the food is very good. Good stop if you're in the area.,1
4,"I came to London from Germany looking for good Indian food-- this place was the best. The food was near authentic and their chai tea was so good.
We had chicken vindaloo and the shrimp curry-- with some rice and naan. Amazing!",1
3,"Food: Meh. Ordered chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, naan, garlic naan, and basmatic rice. So, I thought chicken ticken masala was tandoori chicken in a tomato cream sauce. Well, this was very dry chicken breast that was never tandoori chicken in a pretty good tomato cream sauce. Like I said, meh. But basmatic rice and naan was really good.
Service: Good. But who cares if the food is meh.
Atmosphere: Clean, classy, formal.
Visited on 20 June 2017.",-1
5,"Great food! The chicken tikka Masala is different than I've had at other places. But it's a great difference. It was so tasty. Probably the best I have ever had! Service was also great. One thing both my wife and I noticed is that the staff here is so very nice, warm and welcoming. They even saw a homeless woman outside wearing a brown shawl and went out to offer her some food! I mean come on! Talk about paying it forward! Not only does your establishment deserve an award in customer service and quality and taste of your food, but throw in a humanitarian award in there as well for helping out someone in need! I give all of the staff here my highest respect! That's for making me, my wife and my sleeping son (lol) feel so very welcome in a place that is truly amazing! We were so very fortunate to have stopped by to eat here. Thanks again!",1
5,Very cute cozy restaurant in Covent Garden area. Service was good and the food was yummy. I had my go to dish (chicken tikka masala). It was good but needed a touch more yogurt. Chicken was very tender and cooked perfectly. My local Indian restaurant make the curry a bit more flavorful so I am used to that. Overall great restaurant,1
5,"Very good Indian restaurant! Good service, nice atmosphere and fine food.
If you're looking for a great place to have an Indian meal in London it's hard to beat.",1
4,"I came to London with a group of friends, one of which frequently visits London for work.  I have to admit, I was beyond confused when the first place he wanted to take us was an Indian restaurant.  I did not realize that England's Indian food was so highly regarded! He insisted that Punjab was the best place for us to go.  
I was definitely overwhelmed by the menu.  It is quite extensive!  I had tried Indian food a few times before, but I am certainly no expert.  My friend and I decided to split an order of the Butter Chicken (it sounded simple for us beginners) with sides of Cheese Naan and white rice.  Our friend recommended the Chicken Tika Masala, but we decided to play it safe.
It actually turns out that we should have listened to my friend.  Although the Butter Chicken was good, it was actually much richer and spicier than the Chicken Tika Masala that we tried!  The Chicken Tika Marsala was mild, unique and delicious.  I will definitely be ordering it during my next meal at an Indian restaurant.
Our Butter Chicken WAS enjoyable.  It was very tender and went perfectly over our side of white rice.  However, my favorite part of the meal was the Cheese Naan.  I could have eaten a stack of it!  Naan is an oven-baked flatbread served with Indian food (I did not know this).  The Cheese Naan has a white cheese baked inside the flatbread.  It was AMAZING and I loved it.  I'm actually craving an order as I write about it.
The restaurant was casual, but nice.  I loved the Indian decorations and bold colors.  The service was also wonderful.  The next time I am in London, I will be sure to stop at Punjab for some Chicken Tika Masala and endless orders of Cheese Naan.",1
4,"I wasn't going to leave London without eating Chicken Tikka Masala (it was invented here, or so I'd heard) and made a special trip to Punjab based on the reviews. 
In fact my wife and I almost didn't eat here because when arriving and asking for a table for 2, the host barked ""go outside and wait til I see what I have"" which was a little off putting, since it was a cold December night and we had no idea how long we'd be expected to stand out there. We also arrived at the same moment as a drunken group of 8 who the same host basically told to hit the bricks as they couldn't be accommodated.  
As we were walking away I heard him calling for the table of 2 so we scurried back and they seated us a few minutes later. 
The upstairs dining room was much quieter than the downstairs. At first it was eerily quiet but eventually they turned on some Indian music that improved the the atmosphere a bit. 
Whoever wrote the menu has a good sense of humor. I appreciated that when reading some of the descriptions. 
After 2 entrees, 2 naan breads, 2 drinks, and the service charge, the total came to £44. Great food, unmemorable service, pricier than your typical takeout. Overall a good choice if you only have limited time in London and you can get in the door.",1
5,We absolutely loved our experience at Punjab. I have a wheat/gluten allergy and they were very attentive to ensuring no wheat exposure. The food was delicious (we had a chicken curry and a lamb dish). The service was stellar--we were welcomed warmly and had the opportunity to speak briefly with the owner as we were leaving. I'd highly recommend Punjab if you're in London.,1
4,"You're in London.  You have to get Indian food.  I don't really think it's an option.
I saw this restaurant on one of those shows on Travel Channel or it was on Food Network or something but I had it bookmarked.
It's in Covent Gardens so expect it to be pricey for sure.
I did not have a reservation but I was by myself and I was there relatively early for a Saturday night so I figured I would chance it and just walk over to the restaurant after going to Laduree to pick up macaroons for my trip home.
I was seated upstairs at a table.  The servers were nice and attentive.  The food gets delivered via dumbwaiter up and down the stairs for the most part.
I order butter chicken, garlic naan and some rice.  It was the perfect amount of food but man was it expensive.  It was basically one airline breast of chicken and one piece of naan with a plate of rice and it was over 40 GBP.  Was it good food?  YES.  It was really good.  I would imagine if I was there with a group of people and we order a bunch of things we could share, but I have to question how would you share one piece of chicken?
Overall, I'll definitely be back again if given the chance since it was really good, but it would probably depend on what else i spent money on during that trip",1
5,"No complaints! Arrived around 8 pm and was seated in a few minutes. The food is delicious and spicy! Portions are a good, filling size. Would highly recommend.",1
4,"Good food , good service 
Slightly overpriced for what it is but an enjoyable experience overall!",1
5,"Great Indian food in London -  kids liked it, great flavors - super casual and busy but not overly so.",1
5,"Found this place on Yelp and decided to go in for lunch with my mother who said she does not like Indian Food. I told her give it a chance. I ordered for her. We had Cobra Beer to drink and Paneer Pakora to start (the sauce with the paneer was great!) For our mains we had Chicken Tikka Masala and Pudina Gosht (lamb). The mildness of the Tikka Masala with the spicy Pudina Gosht was great complements to one another. The meat in both dishes was tender and the seasonings were spot on. To go with our mains we had Pilau Rice and Garlic Naan. Both were excellent. If we weren't so full we would have ordered more!
The only thing I can say is the service is a bit brusk on cheeriness but fast response times and there wasn't much of a wait between ordering and receiving food.
We came in around 2pm on a Thursday and one side was full. By the time we started eating our side had every table occupied as well. The decor of the restaurant is also great with old photographs decorating the walls.
Can't wait to return on my next visit to London!",1
4,"My friend took me to Punjab for good Indian food and he wasn't kidding. The service was quick and we ordered a LOT. We shared chicken tikka masala, paneer, and lamb curry. We each got garlic naan bread and I got basmati rice and he got white rice. I also ordered the cucumber salad. Our selection was so good- the curries were flavorful and rich! My salad was sort of sad, I was expecting larger chunks of vegetables, but it did its purpose in cleanses my palate after eating some curry and naan. Overall, Punjab is definitely a place I recommend and would come back to!",1
5,"Good Indian food, but the owner earned the fifth star with his personal service.",1
4,"After a lengthy visit at the British Museum, we hungered for some hardy Indian food. Punjab definitely fulfilled this desire. Here is my take on the service, atmosphere, and most importantly, the food.
Appetizers:
We ordered samosas, a favorite of ours, to start the meal.
Rating: 3/5
The samosas were decent, but lacked the complexity(in terms of spices) that is necessary for a good samosa.
Entrees:
I ordered the chicken tikka special; boneless chicken pieces with  Tandoori 
Seasoning and onions flambéed in Brandy at the table side. Quite delicious pairing with mint yogurt sauce that comes on the side. My only complaint is that the chicken was mildly dry and some of the onions were burnt to blackness. The sauce helped overcome the dryness.
Rating 4/5
My son ordered the Methi Murga; pieces of chicken submerged in mildly spicy tomato sauce with onions. He said that the chicken was very good but the sauce was a bit soupy and needed more onions. 
Rating 4.5/5
Desert:
I ordered Gulab jamun; it had a pleasing doughy texture although I felt the liquid it was bathing in was overly sweet and overwhelmed the more subtle flavors.
Rating 3/5
My son ordered mango lassi; mangoes submerged in a sweet syrup. He said it tasted wonderful, with the syrup covering the tartness of the mango but not overwhelming the flavor.
Rating 5/5
Recommendation: If you are in the area Punjab is a great place to dine.",1
5,Just landed in London and needed some good food. And we found it here. I think we had butter chicken and naan...basic. But it was really good.,1
5,"Fantastic, liked it more than the highly recommended Dishoom, which we also loved.  But Punjab felt a little more comforting, it was busy for sure but we were early and were seated right away.  The food was standout delicious.  From simple items like garlic naan and tikka, with highlights being all the curries and stews we tried.  We found them each to be unique, and we had all veggie items.  Highly recommend.",1
3,"I have to disappointingly give 3 stars the Punjab. I specifically dragged my friend here for dinner because I wanted to go to the oldest Punjabi restaurant in the U.K.  The food here is pretty good. We both loved the apps we got (lamb shish and the pumpkin app). My paneer makhani was fine, but I wish it was spicy. Her chicken tikka speciality was a bit smaller than expected. Sugar and mango lassi's were also good. I was not too thrilled that you have to also buy rice. We ended up buying one naan and one basmati. And if we had wanted water we would have paid. 
But here's where the bigger problem comes. We had no problems with the waiter who seated us and gave us our check. But the waiter who took our orders and brought our food out was a big problem. He's a young guy, probably the youngest there, but that's no excuse for being OFFENSIVE. Let me preface this by saying both my friend and I are American and speak English perfectly without accents (which btw our rude waiter had an accent when he spoke in English) AND YET despite this, he chose to continually say ""arigato"" and ""xie xie"" to my friend, thinking he was cute or funny? I don't know but it's completely unacceptable. It made both of us extremely uncomfortable and he never stopped doing it. Not to mention when he brought my rice out he referred to it as ""arroz"" instead of rice. And he did all of this clearly KNOWING we speak English (better than him for that matter). For these reasons, I'm disappointed that Punjab isn't a place I can recommend to anyone who isn't white or south Asian since our abilities to speak English were questioned while here.",-1
5,All I can say is outstanding!  I went there two times during a five night vacation in London and once again during a trip there the following year.  This is the best Indian food I've ever had.,1
5,"Another fantastic meal at Punjab
Been eating here for 40 years whenever I'm in town 
Food and service always exceptional 
Try the Acharri Gohst with garlic naan
Superb !!!",1
5,"One of the best Indian Restaurants that we have been to.  And the best dinner in London on this trip.  We were promptly seated.  The decor evokes a feeling of old India.  We felt comfortable in our very casual attire.  We ordered Garlic Nan, one of the Chicken curries (ACHARRI MURGHA) Gobi aloo, and some basmati rice.  The waiter suggested some Papadam with a selection of chutney and other sauces. 
We really liked everything served.  And it was served promptly with heated plates.  Some of the items that came with the Papadam were foreign but tasty.  The Curry was spicy but the heat only lasts a few minutes and was the perfect level for us.  Everything was just good good good.
You even get lollipops with your check.  Next time we are on London we will come back.",1
5,"Tuesday night, this place was fit to burst. We actually came here after failing to get into Dishoom (another Indian joint) as they had over an hour's queue. Punjab also had a queue but that one was significantly shorter. 
We came here as a group of 5 people but were soon seated in a cushy corner table. The food was amazing, though some were spicy and the staff were super friendly, evoking images of a close knitted family and even posing for pictures with us and at one point, patiently explaining some of Punjab's background with us as they found us standing by a large map on the wall. 
We were advised to order a variety of dishes and share (which worked out fab for me as I love trying out new foods!!) The menu was expansive but the waiter was patiently and enthusiastically guiding us through it and in the end, we opted for the bold text dishes (which were chef recommendations). Our food arrived promptly and we tucked in. I did admit that I wanted to order more, mainly because it was so good, everyone was fighting for every last morsel! 
I would definitely be coming back to this long standing establishment, with its genuinely friendly service. It honestly felt like I was in their family home, being treated to home cooked food!! If you want genuine North Indian food then go here! It is also the UK's oldest North Indian restaurant!",1
2,"Overall, I was disappointed in my experience at Punjab, which has been recognized throughout the world as "" The Oldest North Indian Restaurant in London."" To be honest, I was saddened by my chicken tikka massala (which, to be honest, tasted more like an American chili than the classic dish I expected - waaaaaaaaaay too much cumin in this recipe). The atmosphere was fine, but nothing special, and the food was a bit overpriced for the quality. All in all, this was a rather lackluster experience with food that was average, at best. While Punjab may be the oldest Indian restaurant in London, it's certainly not the best - by far.",-1
3,"Felt like we needed to have Indian for dinner!! There was a little bit of wait to get in but it wasn't too bad. 
Ordered the butter chicken and naan for myself! I felt the naan was a little dry and the butter chicken and lacking a bit of a kick that you usually get with the spices. 
Service wasn't too bad. Our only complaint was one of the waiters had knocked down my friend's full bottle of beer and didn't replace it. We had to ask him to do it. 
I think I had high expectations based on other reviews I had seen. So I found Punjab to be average.",-1
5,"Wanted a nice feed for our last night in London and could not fault a thing. One of the best service we have ever experienced, the staff were so friendly and on the ball... so attentive & quick! The food was amazing, butter chicken was to die for. Would definitely return!",1
5,"My coworkers and I spent a Saturday in London. I am huge fan of Indian food so it was a must for me. We searched Yelp for recommendations based on our location. The first spot, which I won't name, was more of an fusion restaurant with a limited menu. I knew it wasn't what I wanted because it didn't even smell like an Indian restaurant. Where was the aroma from the spices??? Fortunately, was able to convince my coworkers to look for another restaurant when we came across Punjab. I knew we were in the right spot the moment we walked in the door. We didn't order anything out the ordinary. We shared some chicken masala, Korma chicken, the chickpea dish (I don't believe it was called chana masala here), aloo gobi, rice and garlic naan. Everything was delicious and flavorful!!! One of my coworkers had dietary restrictions so we requested to speak to the manager. He was very attentive and accommodating in fulfilling his needs.  We ordered a bottle of Indian red wine called India Grover's LA Reserve.  It was excellent!! My coworkers told me they were glad I suggested finding another restaurant. I'd definitely go back and highly recommend the Punjab restaurant if you're looking for great  Indian food.",1
5,My first Indian food experience ever. From NYC where the food is significantly better than London in many categories. We were pleasantly surprised vy this outstanding establishment. The owner greeted all the guests at the door and the customer service was excellent! Food was very good. Highly recommend.,1
5,"Had a wonderful dinner here my last trip through London. The best Indian food I've had in years, combined with wonderful service. 
It's quite busy here on a Friday night, so be ready to be cozy.",1
5,"Best service! I was so glad we found this establishment which not only have a great staff and amazing food, but so much history behind it. Everything we had was amazing. Definitely the spot I will be visiting when I'm back in The area.",1
5,"Nice people but slow service, but incredibly delicious food. It's not necessarily cheap, but you get a good amount of food.",1
5,"This is the best place I've eaten in all of London.  It's not a trending setup but if you want food that is freaking great, just come here and stop messing around with everything else.  I love the Punjab Restaurant.",1
5,"Best Indian food I ever had. From the service to food, everything was perfect! Many thanks to staff for providing exceptional service. Cheers!",1
4,"The wifi password is ""butterchicken"" - how awesome is that - I had to laugh a little when the waiter told me
That said - in hindsight maybe I should have ordered that - can't go wrong with butter or chicken. The chicken tikka masala however was excellent so either or I'm sure both are good. 
I'll be honest - I found this spot after getting an hour and 45 minute wait at Dishoom - no thanks, nothing is worth almost a 2 hour wait. I found Punjab which is just a few streets down and I'm glad I did. No wait at all and seemingly more authentic. 
Of course I had to get the chicken tikka masala - the chicken was some of the best I've had at an Indian restaurant - super moist and tender - excellent. The curry base was great as well - it was a little on the lighter side - was hoping for more spices and robust flavor. 
It wasn't on the menu but I got mixed vegetables in a tomato based curry which was also very good. The dishes don't come with rice or naan so I ordered a white rice and garlic naan - the rice was just plain rice, should have ordered the one with the seeds. 
The garlic naan was good but not as good as the bullet naan which I added later on because of the pictures. It's not as spicy as you would think (bullet naan). The samosa was delicious - crunchy outside and soft pillowy potato mash inside. 
 I also got a masala chai tea - very good and spicy. One of the better meals I've had in London - great Punjab food! Portions are good, prices are on par for the city - total came out to about £43 for 2 ppl - appetizers, main courses, drinks.",1
5,Great tasting food.  I had chicken tikka masala and sag paneer.  Lots of cheese in the paneer.  Food was spiced just right.  A bit expensive. They charge for rice aide dish.  Same dishes were $30 in NYC vs 30 pounds in U.K. .  I would highly recommend.  Line was fast less than 10 mins to be seated on a Friday night.  Lighting was awful.  Not a romantic place to take a date.,1
5,"The curry here was stellar.  Get the Chicken Tikka Masala with some rice and naan.  This place has been around for several decades and has a history of their delicious Chicken Tikka Masala.  It's in Covent Gardens, so it can get very crowded with tourists.  Don't come during peak hours and you will have an easy time finding seats and ordering.  Staff was very professional, but expect a gratuity tacked onto your bill.",1
4,"It's pretty good given the touristy crowd and location. Good food and attentive service.
I had the khari ghost, which was good, but I did expect more of a kick to it. The lamb was also not completely tender.
My friend got the butter chicken, a London staple, but I didn't get to try it.
The garlic naan wasn't the best I've had. It has thin slices of garlic on top. I almost prefer it when it's finer pieces.
Mango lassi was fine, but not very sweet. I think it's a good option if you're around central London. I liked the attentive service, but I'm not sure if I'd queue up for it. There's always a line out the door.",1
3,"Nice, authentic, home made flavors and feel to the food. Service was great and the ambience was cozy while feeling a bit dated, which is likely intentional. Overall, good experience and I would dine here again.",-1
4,"Similar to some other reviewers here, I also wanted to go to Dishoom but the wait was so long and we really wanted Indian food so we yelped and found this place. I'm glad we did! 
The service was a bit rocky at first. ""What you want? ... No you wait. Let me finish writing.""  Uhhhh, what??  But then the waiter came back and was okay again. He served naan and garlic naan, both deliciously buttery and soft. We almost wished we saved the naan to eat with our meal instead but gobbled it up quickly. I loved my chicken Tikka special- the spices marinated in the meat perfecto with an abundance amount of sauce to mix with the rice. My husbands butter chicken was a little bit dry but he said the flavor was bold and spicy, just the way he expected it. 
We didn't have room for dessert unfortunately but a mango lassi was quite enough for me to leave happily and satisfied.",1
5,The food here is reallllly good. I had a little bit of everything because I was dining with a large group. They have several spicy dishes that are actually spicy enough to taste the difference. They have 4 or 5 different kinds of Naan. We were kind of loud due to the size of our party but the way waitstaff was as very understanding and patient with my group.,1
5,"Excellent meal, great service, and only a 20 minute wait on a Friday night.",1
5,"I came to Punjab with a few friends for dinner and had not only a great experience but some phenomenal indian food.  We came on a Friday night and weren't sure how long the wait would be, but they were able to seat us within 5 minutes of arriving.  We started out with Samosas which were delicious and not at all greasy.   For our main course we shared chicken tikka, butter chicken, along with two standouts the bullett naan (spread with chopped fresh chilli and garlic) and the saag paneer which was beautifully spiced, not oily and tasted like fresh spinach.   Not only is the food good, but the service is also on point.  Our waiter was attentive and food arrived fast, hot and as ordered. 
A+",1
5,"This was our best meal in London! We were seated right away, service was fast and accurate, and most importantly the food was delicious. Chicken was slow cooked and fell apart. The menu has tons of options - so there's something for everyone. Great place!",1
5,"A few of my friends and I came to London for the day on our way back from Glasgow. We had been craving Indian and decided we would on our last night. With the help of Yelp we came across Punjab. It was the best Indian I have ever had, I am very loyal to one family owned one in my home town but this exceeded all expectations. The food was delicious, staff was friendly and helpful. We had ordered butter chicken, tandoori chicken and chicken tikka. No food was left! 
I would recommend making a reservation, we were lucky at 6 to get a table. Leaving though we saw the line out the door and along the restaurant! 
We met briefly with the owner who was extremely generous, he is part of the fourth generation running this restaurant. I know my next trip to London I will be making an other appearance! Thank you Punjab!",1
5,"Delicious classic, light Indian dishes. Owner was so friendly and accommodating. We loved the carrot cake!",1
4,"Definitely get the chicken tikka masala! So good! Don't order the buttered chicken if you aren't expecting a slight kick. We were seated immediately upon arrival (party of 2), and the staff was very attentive and kind. The fried lentil and lamb appetizer is delicious, but be warned -- there isn't much of it. So don't order to split if you're hungry! Portion sizes of the entrees are larger than one might come to expect in London. 
Decor was interesting and cool -- one might call it slightly dated, but when the food is that good, who cares? 
The restaurant is easy to find and within walking distance of an excellent ice cream place!",1
4,"Solid and reliable spot for northern Indian cuisine - I always swing by at least once when I visit London. Both lentil dishes (yellow and black) are to die for. Love the methi gosht. Acharri and karahi dishes are also really good here.
I get the feeling this place tones down the spiciness, so if you're a regular Indian eater and like spicy, make sure to ask staff to bump it up a bit. For example, the biryani dishes are not nearly spicy enough in their ""standard"" forms. Same with the jalfrezi - the basic flavor is very good, but could definitely use a bump up on the spiciness. That said, once you request spicy, it really does get spicy!
Also, one of the better gajar halwa I've had. If you're a fan, make sure you save room. Even if you're not (and you don't hate carrots as a dessert), give it a try.
Go at lunch to avoid the queues.",1
5,"Wonderful food.  The owner was incredibly friendly.  I especially loved how friendly they were to my kids who have nut allergies.  We rarely eat Indian food because of their allergies,  but they really enjoyed it!",1
5,"One of the best north Indian restaurants outside of India! We ordered vegetarian curries - paneer  tikka masala, the best Channa Masala I ever had, naan and biryani. Everything was so delicious. Great service too. Will definitely return when I go back to London.",1
4,"We went to Punjab because there was a wait at another Indian restaurant. We were seated promptly, but the table was a little small for our family. We ordered naan and I got chicken korma. There is only one circle of naan per serving, would have preferred more per serving. My chicken korma was excellent and just the right spice amount. Went well with rice. I enjoyed my food. My biggest complaint is that they charge you for your water, which comes in fancy bottles. Overall, a nice Indian restaurant that is centrally located.",1
4,"We went on a working lunch here today. For a Tuesday it was surprisingly busy (I see Indian/Punjabi food as a night time meal really). We went based on Yelp reviews, obviously, and we weren't disappointed. 
It announces itself as the UK's Oldest North Indian Restaurant and the photos and articles around the room provide you with its history. The decor isn't anything to shout out about but it's simple and comfortable which I liked.
The waiter was slightly abrupt but in a comical way. He provided us with the wifi password via the menu (butterchicken) and helped with the food recommendations - I'm glad he did! 
We started with popadoms, pretty standard, but the chutneys which accompanied them were unisual particularly the greeny grain looking one (not sure if the name - sorry) which was tangy yet delightful.
We then shard the Samosa's - crispy not soggy pastry (which does happen) on the outside, and the inside was almost creamy, stuffed with meat and potatoes with fantastic flavours running through.
Now to the dish I was prompted to try, the Archarri Margha, I truly enjoyed this! You could tell that the ingredients were fresh and that they take pride in their special dishes and you could really taste tang!
It was first Punjabi food experience, it won't be my last!
To note: the prices are really decent especially for a restaurant in Covent Garden.",1
2,"SERVICE:
The customer service here has some serious room for improvement. Between the moments I stepped in the restaurant to the moment I stepped out, each interaction with the staff felt very impersonal and unfriendly. If I say ""Thank you"" to a waiter, he would just stare at me and walk away. When it was time for me to pay, the person who inserted my credit card didn't even say a word. He just took the card, printed out a receipt, let me sign it, and walked away. Not a single eye contact. Wow. On top of all that, I'm required to give a ""10 percent optional service"" fee.
PRICE:
My total amounted to 14.25 GBP for Butter Chicken with rice. That's about $23.63 USD for those living in the states. People say that this place is cheap but I think it's expensive. I have been to other Indian restaurants where my total is about 11 GBP for the same or more portion of food. 
FOOD:
I ordered the Butter Chicken and rice. The Butter Chicken included two pieces of chicken still on the bone. The gravy was good and had a slight spiciness to it. It goes well with rice or naan (not included in the price). 
If the customer service was better, I would have given this place a 3 out of 5 stars.",-1
1,"*Very rude behaviour*
Apparently there's a rule that the order should exceed 15 pounds per person.
We were a party of four visiting - one of us wasn't too hungry and our order fell short initially. The waiter first pointed the rule out to us with a rude ""can't be done.""
After finding out about the rule, we told the waiter that we'll order dessert in the end to cover the difference. Yet again the waiter in his border line accusatory tone said ""what if you don't?""
My Rating is not because of the rule - the restaurant is entitled to keep it. However, I do think the waiters could do a much better job of explaining it to customers understanding that they're not thieves trying to trick them.",-1
3,"My hubby really wanted Indian food in London, and our first choice was Dishoom, but when we got there we saw it was closed for renovations (we probably should've checked the website in advance...), so we quickly scrambled and found Punjab. There was a 20 minute wait, and the little wait area is so tiny and crowded. We moved around as people came and went (it was raining outside, duh, so couldn't wait there), after the time passed we were seated at a table upstairs. The restaurant is huge and it was packed. 
My hubby really wanted to try some stuff he doesn't see on menus in the US, and he did, I can't remember what it was that he ordered though (something very spicy), but he really liked it! We also ordered samosas, naan, chicken tikka masala, some veggies, and rice since it did not come with the meat dishes, weird. The food was good! The flavors were very authentic and tasty, the naan was delicious! The service was ok, I kept having to ask for water, which seems to be on par for London (I had to basically beg for refills everywhere!) but overall this place was pretty good! We definitely left quite full!",-1
5,"BEST indian food in London for sure (Coming from someone that grew up in India!) Flavors were authentic,the laccha parantha was on point and the service was friendly. The naan is one of the best I have had here in London. The quality of the food is as good or even better than dishoom and the setting is more authentic. I'm so glad to have found this place and will be a regular patron moving forward.",1
5,"We went here for a dinner, on a weekday night. we expected a long wait, but were seated in 5 - 10 minutes. The service was prompt and courteous. We started off with vegetable samosas. 
For main course, we ordered the butter chicken and baigan as gravies, with rice and naan. It was one of the best Indian food I have had outside India. The butter chicken reminded me of food in local dhabas in Punjab :') we absolutely loved our dinner here!",1
4,"We wanted to dine at another Indian restaurant but they had an hour and a half wait on a Saturday night. We walked to Punjab hoping to get dinner. We were fortunate to get a table for four.
Ambiance: bare minimum, no great wall decorations. It is a series of small rooms.
Service was good but they tried very hard to rush us through dinner. We fought them off. Manager was nice to take pics of the foursome outside.
Food: was good, northern Indian. Our vegan friend ordered sweet and spicy pumpkin and a lentel dish, tarka dall. We also tried the prawn puri, spicy shrimp on a crispy puri. Very tasty. We also ordered 2 butter chicken entrees, a Punjab specialty. Delicious, tasty and very enjoyable.
Overall, a nice experience.",1
5,"London is known as a mecca for delicious Indian food. You're more likely to find a place selling tikka masala than the traditional English fish and chips while visiting. Because of this, I knew I had to try some good Indian food when I went to London. I knew it would be the best Indian food I can get without actually being in India. While doing research about where to eat, my sister and I stumbled upon Punjab. Punjab is known as one of the best Indian restaurants London has to offer. On any given night, you will have to wait up to an hour to get seated. 
My sister and I arrived at a good time. A bit before 7pm, and with hardly any line. Since we were only a party of 2, we were seated in about 25 minutes. The restaurant is much larger than it looks on the outside. When you first walk in you think there is only one room for dining, but then you see that there is another room, and even more seating upstairs. My sister and I were directed to the upstairs seating. The ambiance of the restaurant is very homey. Punjab isn't trying to be fashionable, and it isn't trying to be the best in London. This is just some good Indian food without all the hoopla. 
When we sat down, we knew we wanted to get something to drink. After looking at the drinks menu we decided to get the India Grover's Sauvignon Blanc. We thought it would be interesting to try some Indian wine. The wine was wonderful and refreshing. When I came time to order appetizers, I knew I had to get samosas. I can't have an Indian meal without trying the samosas. The samosas offered at Punjab were some of the best I've had. We also split some garlic naan. I garlic naan was just as good as the samosas. For my meal I got the chicken tikka masala. Chicken tikka masala is my go to Indian dish, and it was renowned in London. I just had to get it. The chicken tikka masala was outstanding. I loved the tomato based sauce that the chicken comes in. My sister got the karahi paneer and thought it was great. There were no complaints from her about any of the dishes. The entire meal was absolutely perfection.
The service was also really great. All the waiters and employees were very nice, and courteous. I also appreciate that we were only waiting outside for 25 minutes when it was very cold outside. My only issue with Punjab is that I don't live in London and I can't visit as often as I wish I could. Punjab is a restaurant I would recommend to people visiting London.",1
4,"Good if you're feeling some Indian. Portions are on the smaller side, but the flavour is definitely there. Can be a line but it moves quick. Clothing can smell of spices after.",1
5,"Dined here for dinner during our recent trip to London. We actually initially tried to go to Dishoom down the street, but they had a 90 minute wait. When we asked the hostess at Dishoom about other good Indian restaurants in the area, she directed us to Punjab. 
We had some papadams and samosas for appetizer. My wife had the chicken tikka masala, and I had the lamb roganjosh. All simply fantastic. 
The following day, we trekked out to the famed Brick Lane for some more Indian food, but honestly, Punjab blows away the Indian food on Brick Lane. We will definitely make a return trip to this restaurant on our next trip to London.",1
4,"So recently I've become an Indian food lover. London has a plethora of Indian food restaurants located on every corner. I wanted to find a good one for our first night in London. I looked at reviews online and I found Punjab. Upon entering it looked pretty busy for a Wednesday night they have it set up with almost a fine dining appeal. We were seated right away, which is always a plus in my book. I ordered the Strongbow cider to drink, which I was told was London's signature cider but I had never tried it before. To eat I ordered the garlic naan, the dahl, and the chicken tikka masala. Everything came out pretty quickly and it was all very good and I devoured it down but the stand out for me was the garlic naan I think it was the best I ever had. The service was friendly and attentive. I'd recommend this place to every fellow Indian food lover to try out.",1
4,"The amritsari fish is ok. It's like fried fish with a lot of seasoning in the coating. The dipping sauce is very good though. Then we had butter chicken,  lamb madrus, and acharri gosht. They all taste good but similar. All dishes tend to be a bit salty. Lamb madrus is the best as the meat is most tender and the dish is most spicy. The garlic naan is perfect. The cheese naan tastes good but a bit oily. The service is pretty good in general.",1
5,Ok... my favorite food is now Indian food. Indian food made from  this Pakistani family at this restaurant. WOW! That's enough said... spicy deliciousness that made my 10 year old ask for more and more.,1
5,"You must try it 
the fooooooood is so good
You must try it 
the fooooooood is so good
You must try it 
the fooooooood is so good
But it's very spicy be careful",1
5,"Visiting London for a couple of weeks and I found this place on Yelp. I love, love, love Indian food, so I put it on my list early on to stop at. When I got there the line was pretty big and I wasn't too sure how quickly it was going to move. I easily put in a takeaway order and my food was ready in 10 minutes. The owner of the establishment was incredibly nice and even threw a couple of jokes my way even though it seemed like a mad house inside. I wouldn't normally think of this, but this place really splurges on the takeaway packaging. The containers were sealed really well and the bag was sturdy and leakproof, in case the containers didn't work. The only reason why I mention this is because this made it really easy to go through the Underground on a Saturday night without getting curry all over the place.
I ordered the Kadu Sabji-their signature pumpkin curry (because I'm American and Americans love all things pumpkin this time of year), plain rice, and garlic naan. The food was PERFECTION. The curry was nicely spiced and had whole chunks of pumpkin in it that were perfectly tender. The garlic naan was also something to write home about. Very soft and chewy. Though, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone expecting to get a kiss afterwards; I suppose unless you both eat it then it cancels out. The meal is definitely enough for 2, which means I have some left over to enjoy tomorrow!
Go here, seriously.",1
5,"I admit I had some reluctance to come here as opposed to the newer, more modern Indian restaurants which are more trendy in London these days.  But I have no regrets, it was delicious.  Of course, we ordered the Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala.   Both were so delicious, I ate past the point of fullness.",1
5,Delicious food with large menu and Attentive and friendly staff. My boyfriend has a nut allergy so they gave us a menu with all of the allergies and dietary restriction labeled which was very convenient. Must visit!,1
5,You never fail me Punjab...everything I eat when I go is perfect and fantastic...always worth the wait.  See you next time!,1
5,"I'm so glad we found this Covent Garden gem! This restaurant is in a tiny house, complete with a dumbwaiter for serving up the good to second floor (unique for us Americans).
Walking up it looked like a club with a short line outside, but we got seated quickly and the service and food were fantastic. My husband was weary of Indian food but he was impressed with the chicken tikka masala, you can never go wrong there.
I had the mutter paneer since I going for a milder dish. It was amazing! Make sure you get the Pilau cumin rice, best rice I've ever had anywhere. We miss Punjab, Indian food is terrible in Texas. :(",1
5,"the BEST Indian food ever!  my nephew and niece and I agree, it was the most delicious and memorable Indian food- not only was the food extraordinary but the owner Amrit gave that special touch to make us feel like guests.  All the staff were great. 
Any Americans who go to London MUST stop by lovely Covent Gardens and go to this restaurant-  it will be memorable.",1
5,"Good food for sure. We were 2 of us, and since we were not very hungry we ordered 2 Sweet Lassi, 1 Methi Gosht and 2 Bullet Naan. 
The portion size was good. Bullet Naan was quiet delicious.
Definitely recommended.",1
5,"Delicious meal...pumpkin puri appetizer, cheese Naan, Italian wine...when advising me about the Butter Chicken being bone in vs. Tiki Marsala boneless, waiter in error ordered the Tiki, they ended up providing me some of both to make up it for delicious and great service!  I'll be back for sure!",1
4,"We have heard a lot of good things regarding England and Indian food. My wife and I decided that we had to have it at least once during our UK vacation. Just by chance, right before our trip we saw a Food Network program that had a special on food in London. One of the places that they pointed out was Punjabi. We randomly ran into Punjabi while walking around, remembered it for the program, and decided to eat there. 
The food at Punjabi was really good and surprisingly cheap. At the end of the meal we were surprised at how low our bill was.
We had the Samosas (a must get), the chicken tikka masala, and the saag paneer. All items were great. We shared a mango lassi as well (yum!). 
Recommended place to eat. We went on the later side and it wasn't TOO busy but I've heard if you good at prime dinner time it can be a bit crowded.",1
5,"No matter how frazzled or worn out you are once you sit down at the Punjab, read the menu here and you'll be in good spirits before you even order food. Such a witty little menu. 
This place gets backed for dinner  - we went for lunch and got seated immediately. They were taking reservations the entire time we were there. Go at lunch.
I ordered the chicken tikka masala since it's the most famous dish in London, and I purposefully chose this place when doing research. The reviews weren't wrong! 
This was the best Indian food I've ever had! The chicken was so smokey, the sauce so creamy and everything in between so flavorful. I'm obsessed and want some now. 
Get the samosas, the sweet lassi, plain naan and rice and you'll be all set.",1
3,"Really wanted to love this place, and although the food is good, it just doesn't justify the prices to me- I've been able to get some food that's just as nice or better for so much cheaper in London. Seating is very crowded, but I actually like that. Be prepared to wait if you have a big group or go on a weekend.",-1
5,"Indian cuisine lover, easily some of the best I have ever had. Great staff who clearly take pride in their food. Would give them 10000000 stars if I could",1
4,"Great service--exceptional.  We were there early (around 5:30) and they told us we could only have a table if we were done by 7:30.  This was blunt but to the point and I'd rather them say that then tell us no.  The service was great--within moments of asking, we had everything we needed.  
We had the Daal, Malai Kofta, and one of the signature dishes (all from the vegetarian menu).  They were all solid.  Everything was on the spicy side (rather than creamy and sweet) and it was good.  Prices were reasonable.",1
5,"Punjab was the start of my incredible Indian food adventures in London, and I'm so happy we got to try it! My friend and I came in sans reservation on Sunday around 7:30 PM, and it was totally fine. There were other diners in the restaurant, but it wasn't too full.
We ordered the garlic chicken, butter chicken, garlic naan, and mango lassis, and everything was AMAZING. I did prefer the garlic chicken over the butter chicken, but both were great, and the naan was perfect for sopping up all the delicious sauce. Mango lassis were nothing inventive but still delicious and refreshing. 
Punjab's staff was also super helpful--giving us recommendations on things to do before we returned to our apartment later that evening and even chasing us out the restaurant to make sure we were headed in the right direction.
If you're looking for authentic and delicious Indian food, don't miss it! :)",1
5,"Was the only tikka masala I tried when in London, and judging by the taste and quality and I'm positive it's the only tikka masala you need to try when there. Also, impeccably fast service.",1
5,"You absolutely have to make room on your busy itinerary for some Punjab! Honestly, prior to my trip to London, I never preferred to eat Indian food. However, Punjab has changed it all! In particular, their Chicken Tikka Masala! You cannot leave London without trying their Chicken Tikka Masala. The sauce is absolutely delicious with its creamy and flavorful texture. It isn't too spicy either if you regularly cannot handle heat.  To go with this, I actually preferred the spiced rice over the naan. I believe it's seasoned with cumin and maybe some turmeric. I am more of a rice than a bread person though. 
The only downside of this place is the service. They know they are the best so service isn't all too friendly and attentive. They also slap on an ""Optional"" service fee. We didn't bother asking them to remove it, considering how long it took to place our order and to get our bill. Nonetheless, this place is still worth check out!",1
4,"Definitely the best Indian I had in London, and I hit no less than a dozen places.  The paneer makhani, my favorite, was top knotch.  
You really can't go wrong here.  Definitely a great lunch choice.",1
4,"We came here on a recent trip to London. My family is Indian and we had heard about all the great Indian restaurants in London and had received a recommendation for this restaurant from a friend. We ordered the butter chicken, saag aloo, daal, and paneer tikka masala. Everything was delicious and very authentic. One of the best meals we had on our vacation.",1
3,A bit overrated thought it was decent Indian food.  Dishoom is way better go there instead.  Chicken Tikka Masala was kind of bland.,-1
5,"Amazing Indian food!! So authentic in their cooking it was like my Indian friend was cooking for me in her home! I loved stopping here for a late dinner with friends, they had quick service and were able to accommodate a vegan diet. I got a menu for people with allergies, and ordered a chickpea dish with a side of rice. It was delicious! They warned me that the food I ordered is spicy, but it was perfect. We had our own dishes with naan to share, it was a perfect meal! Definitely come here if you're looking for Indian food in London.",1
5,"Was recommended a trendy Indian restaurant which had a massive wait. Found Punjab on yelp and was absolutely delighted. 
Wait was less than they said, service was spot on, atmosphere was great and food was fantastic!",1
5,My Boyfriend and me loved the delicious vegetarian meal. Thanks a lot as well for the polite service. We are coming back,1
4,We are recent connoisseurs of Indian cuisine and this place is very very good. Service was quick the food was delicious ....what else can we ask for.   Just make sure you get there early because by the time we left there was a queue of about 20 people out front door.,1
5,"excellent food, impeccable service & the atmosphere was great. fresh ingredients, wonderful masala chai tea and mango ice cream to finish the meal. we're here in town one more day and we'll be coming back again tomorrow",1
4,Really delicious meal from start to finish!! Generous portions. Vegan and gluten free options available. Ask for an allergy menu if you have dietary requirements.,1
5,"Fantastic Indian cuisine, with excellent range of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Can get rather busy, but it's a local treasure and well worth the wait. 10/10 for an all around great find, in a charming city.",1
4,"Food: incredible. You really do need to add this to your London to-do list if only here for a few days. Came with my parents, international Indian fans and they were very impressed. But not with the service! We spent probably an hour here and it took us 20 minutes to eat. The other 40 was twenty waiting for a beer out of a bottle (I mention this because I can open a beer bottle in 10 seconds flat!) (they brought beer WITH food) and twenty waiting on the check. Then verbally suggested a 20% tip. Not too classy. But the food!!! Lamb and chicken cooked to PERFECTION!",1
5,"A true gem among so many wonderful places for curry in London. Yes, it is in a location that attracts tourists but be discouraged by that. It is truly delicious Northern Indian cuisine.  
I love the Jalfrezi and Punjabi Samosa. Chana Masala is amazing as well. Delicious -- fresh and so nicely balanced that it is fun to try to discern the individual spices even though it all blends so well.
I've been going for many years and the staff are always the same and that says so much. Everyone is kind and the service is amazing. A long time family business. The owner seems always to be there and making sure the service and food are perfect. And it is.",1
3,"Taste: 3
Creativity/Authenticity: 3
Atmosphere: 3.5
Service: 2
Bang for your buck: 3
Let me start by saying when in London which claims to have the best indian food your not gonna find it here. I'm free Los Angeles and we'll punjab is about the same as LA; Los Angeles might be better!! First our waiter was very rude, service Def needs work. As far as the food goes nothing special the condiments tasted like pre package jar sauces, their chicken masala just another indian dish nothing that a place that claims to be the first indian restaurant in London should taste like. If you want indian food you can probally find another place that has just as good food if not better i suggest for the price of punjab you go eat at dishoom way better service, better food but make a reservation. Good luck",-1
5,"Tried three Indian restaurants on our 8 day vacation to London and we all really enjoyed this restaurant the most.  Good food, good service, good location.",1
5,"I definitely agree with others - don't wait for Dishoom.  Come here and you can eat very well.  We actually wanted something more home style and lighter than the creamy sauces you'd find at typical Indian restaurants.  We asked for the dishes to be prepared with as little oil as possible, but maximum flavor (spices, etc.) and they delivered!  The food was delicious, vibrantly spiced, and not too heavy.",1
4,"This restaurant deserves to have been in business for as long as it has been. With so many restaurants to choose from in London, Punjab consistently offers delicious food, quality ingredients and friendly staff. Locals know about it and hopefully tourists get to appreciate this much-loved restaurant.",1
4,"Tried their house specialty chicken , the stew lacked depth in flavor that Indian cuisine is famous for. The base was pretty much tomatoes with chili powder. I was expecting to taste aromas of roasted seeds layered with other species . And the chicken kabob was surprisingly bland! It came in a flaming hot skillet drizzled with a believe some kind of alcohol. 
delicious was mango lasi drink.  service was very nice
Must try curry chicken & butter chicken! Delicious !",1
4,"Good food, decent service and ambiance. 
We stumbled upon Punjab during a recent visit to London. We were on the hunt for Indian food, saw a line out the door and figured it would be an hour wait. Don't be deterred by the line outside, it moves very quickly and we were seated within 15 minutes. However the first thing we were told before we sat down was that we had to be out by 8 o'clock, which was about an hour-and-a-half away. That was fine, but a little strange we were being rushed before we had even ordered. The atmosphere was also very basic inside, it's definitely more on the casual side. 
We decided to order  a good variety of starters and main plates because we quite enjoy Indian cuisine. We ordered Samosas and papadom with mango chutney to start. The chutney was delicious. We then followed that with chicken tikka masala, vegetable curry, chicken korma and peshwari naan bread. The portions were decently sized, not overwhelmingly big. The food was all good and the naan bread was fantastic. 
My only issue with Punjab was that we felt rushed the whole time we were there. It felt like they were just waiting to take our plates away and hurry us along so they could seat the next group of people. I noticed they did that with all of the tables in the restaurant, which took away from the experience as a whole. Overall this was a good restaurant.",1
4,"Came here for dinner. Had the samosas, garlic naan, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala and cumin rice. Everything was delicious and flavorful except the butter chicken. The butter chicken was a little pink by the bone. 
There was no wait. Staff was attentive and nice. Service was quick. Would definitely recommend this place!",1
5,"We originally wanted to go to Dishoom, but being closed for construction we quickly searched up another place and found here. I'm so glad we found it! There was barely any wait and we were seated quickly. The servers were helpful and friendly. The food here is great. The only disappointment I had was not being able to try the dish that lit up on fire. Which every other table seemed to have got instead.. 
This was one of the best and cheapest places we ate in London on our trip.",1
5,"Came here with my boyfriend when we were visiting London, we both loved it. I got the Chicken Tikka Masala with naan and aloo gobi, everything was fresh. I wish they opened up a restaurant in the states!",1
5,"Probably the best Indian food in Central London. Curries are very good and prepared fresh. Things to try:
- Daal Tarka
- Paneer Makhani
- chana masala
Chapati felt like home made.
Drinks: mango lassi had good flavor.",1
4,"This is a London institution and behaves as such. Waiters are plentiful and efficient, some friendly others appeared stressed. Bottles of beer and pints of lager abound as do young Americans.  Food is fine, portion sizes not too big.",1
4,"A classic Indian restaurant in the heart of London, specializing in the north, specifically the Punjab. Don't expect modern interpretation of Indian food, fusion or anything like that - expect a typical British Indian restaurant, done just right. I've visited the place many times before when in London, mainly owing to its central location, and it never disappoints. Prices are very reasonable too, despite the prime location.",1
4,"Nice location for this wonderful Indian eatery, there is not much room so its a bit of a shuffle game dealing with the space. We had a reservation and they were very friendly and accommodating. Some of our party was late for a reservation and they adjusted for us. The food was quite good, this is a northern indian place with reasonable prices.",1
4,"My family and I visited this restaurant while on vacation to London last week. It's an easy walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station and was easy to find. 
Once seated we checked out their menu and settled on a few dishes for us to share. We ordered the Punjabi Samosa, Acharri Murgha, Tarka Daal, and Methi Gosht to name a few and the meal was delicious. We ordered a mixture of chicken, vegetarian, and lamb dishes. All the dishes had their own unique flavor, spice, and aroma. The staff were all attentive and saw to our every need. 
We all agreed that we would recommend this restaurant to anyone who was looking to have a great Indian meal while in London.",1
4,"Service and ambiance are nice. We arrived when they first opened and the restaurant had an overwhelmingly strong scent of cleaning solution. Not sure if it always smells like that.
We liked everything we tried and the spices in the dishes really stood out in comparison to some of the other places we have tried. The dishes also had a nice smoky flavor.
CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA £9.50 No standard recipe exists for this classic dish, however our 1973 formula continues to withstand the test of time, Chicken Tikka served in tandoori masala & tomato based sauce
BUTTER CHICKEN £9.75 The godfather of all punjabi dishes, succulent chicken on the bone served in a creamy
BUTTER NAAN £2.35 Simple but sumptuous flatbread expertly baked against the walls of the tandoor",1
4,"Today was my third meal here. I've enjoyed each one. Amidst the hustle of Covent Garden, this little place would be easy to overlook. Please don't.  Just about everything here has been consistently good, and everyone I've eaten here with has loved it. Despite a minor mix up today with my food being delivered to the adjacent table, service is good if a tiny bit unhurried, and food quality is excellent. A few highlights:
Onion pakora - little fritters of gram flour (believe it's chickpea flour) mixed with onions and spice and fried to a delicious crunch
Hariyali chicken - mentioned by at least one other reviewer, it's a bit showy when it comes sizzling to your table, and it tastes great. Skewered chicken coated in yogurt, coriander, mint, garlic, ginger and chile and cooked in the tandoor. This is my favorite! No sauce, FYI, but some grilled onions underneath are great
Bullet naan - naan with garlic and green chiles - not overpoweringly flavored, but really nice alongside the other dishes - I liked the little bit of extra spice this added to my meal
One I won't order again- the mixed vegetable curry - I should've inquired more about this one, as it just wasn't ""green"" enough for me, having lots of potatoes, carrots, and peas in it. Oh well, I'll stick with my okra or saag dishes next time
Do check this little place out. They take Amex, too, for those who care.",1
3,"3.5 stars for me.  The food was good, but nothing special that would make me want to come again.  Had the Chicken Tikka Masala, samosa, vegetable curry.  Garlic naan was blah. I dont know why this restaurant was so busy, but there was definitely a crowd.",-1
5,Punjab is a fantastic restaurant with the most amazing staff! I highly recommend this restaurant for the authentic cuisine and the family atmosphere. Amrit and Angelo certainly understand the meaning of fine dining and great customer service. Thank you for a fantastic meal!,1
2,"Well beyond its Use-by date.  Decor is tired.... threadbare dirty carpets and worn furniture.  Food was also a huge disappointment. I love Indian cuisine .... but you can walk down any suburban UK high street and get better than this. Having visited India several times, with a name like Punjab, I had especially high expectations of the tandoori dishes...again a huge disappointment as the meats had none of the smoky charcoal flavor one expects from genuine tandoor cooking. Moreover the ""curry"" dishes had no depth of flavor and all seemed to have been microwave reheated as they were delivered to our table within less than 2 mins of ordering. This place is trading off a long past reputation.",-1
3,"*Be aware of the £15 minimum per person purchase, our neighbors were kicked out for wanting to order apps only, see below*
We ordered the vegetable biryani with vegetable curry, chicken madrasa, bullet naan and a beer. The rice and chicken madrasa was very flavorful, spicy and worth the order. The bullet naan wasn't anything special, the cilantro and chillies didn't add much flavor. 
*Food was delicious, however, the lead waiter was pretty rude to other guests (we were there at 3:30 pm: he asked a couple to leave for only waiting to order appetizers, and a father wanted to sit next to the window with his daughter but he wouldn't let them).",-1
3,Nice ambience and service. Seated quickly. Food was good but for London standards was just 'ok'. Lacking salt all around and I'm not one who likes a lot of it.,-1
2,"I've always wanted to visit this restaurant since it is supposed to be the oldest North Indian restaurant in London. 
We ordered the vegetable pakora for an appetizer, but found some hair in it. Not good. The mango lassis were good but not great. 
We ordered the malai kofta with vegetable biriyani and Naan (bullet and garlic). The naans came way after the kofta was almost gone - not good again. 
With some many other Indian options like Dishoom and Gymkhana around, I will not be back.",-1
5,"Pricey, but the best Indian food I've ever had, and my home is close to Fremont, California. Make sure to get a nice cobra beer with your meal :). We had a paneer dish, but the butter chicken and lamb korma were sooo money. I wish the sides of rice and naan were included though..",1
4,"The Resturant is nice and clean & the waiters are attentive .
I ordered the samosas , nothing to spectacular but it was perfectly cooked not oily or over cooked 
For the main course I ordered the lamb chop curry , & tikka Masala  , white rice  and garlic nan bread.
I was warned by the waiter that  my lamb chop curry would be spicy,  which I love . However , the curry sauce wasn't as spicy enough  to me . They gave  a nice portion of pieces of lamb chops with the bone. I enjoyed my meal very much but wish it was spicer.
The tikka masala was very well prepared the sauce was so good and fresh . 
The garlic nan bread was so good and hot and perfect to use to dip up the sauce from your plate 
 
I didn't order any drinks just seltzer( sparkling )  water",1
5,"Excellent service and excellent food! This place was very authentic (according to an Indian friend who I spoke to after going here) and reasonably priced. Everything is a la carte, however, which I wasn't aware of so it took a little while to get everything ordered that I needed for a full meal. Nonetheless, the food is hearty and the spice level is right on point. I'm someone who enjoys fiery foods and felt that their spice level was adequate. Great place!",1
5,"Great food! We'd been looking for a really good Indian restaurant and Punjab did not disappoint. Staff was friendly and courteous, and the food was outstanding! A few other tourists (like us) but also a good number of locals -- always a good sign. After a full day of sightseeing we were exhausted. We didn't feel rushed at all and somehow managed to finish everything. We'll definitely be making another stop at Punjab the next time we visit London!",1
5,"The most amazing Indian food I have ever had, period. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and I'm totally addicted to their curry! The service is amazing! I have a food allergy and the staff went out of their way to make sure there was no cross contamination. I would eat here every day if I could!",1
5,This place was incredible! By far the best meal we had while in London. The Chicken Tikka Masala with rice and a spicy naan is a must try. Definitely plan on coming back when we return.,1
5,"Excellent. Food was exceptional and owner sat us down and gave us a little history and food recommendations. We had some great chicken, lamb and vegi dishes.  Seems very popular and you may want to make reservations.",1
5,Loved this place!  Best Indian food I have ever had. The flavors were incredible. Loved the tandoori chicken and cumin rice. I'm a light weight when it comes to eating spicy food and I was able to eat many things on the menu. The servers were so friendly and helpful and very fast. The restaurant has a great environment.,1
5,"We were originally going to try Dishoom but the line was so long, so we opted to grab takeaway from Punjab.  One of the best Indian meals I've had!  Note that if you grab for takeaway, you get a discount (as with most places in London).  While we were waiting for our food, I ordered a mango lassi which was perfect and not overly sweet.
The garlic naan was buttery and had excellent flavor and giant pieces of garlic (which is a plus to me).  The chicken tikka masala had so much flavor, and the lamb korma was very creamy.  I think this place had the hands-down best tikka masala I had.  The prices are going to be a little steeper than what I'm used to in America, but we had leftovers that were still great the next day.  Service was excellent for us while we were waiting for our food, and they made sure to provide us with all the utensils that we needed.",1
5,"I loved the food. And the wine is more than what I'm use to. My boyfriend and I shared the chicken tikka masala because we thought it would be too much for the both of us. Know that you need to add an order or rice and vegetables because it's not included with the main dish. We also added cheese naan, which I also loved! Lastly we ordered a milky dessert with bread in it and I also thought that was delicious! I would definitely return here for more meals. Service was extremely professional and friendly and quick.",1
1,"One of our friends was on her way, and the staff didn't give us a table until she arrived. This is not the hospitality I would expect from any decent restaurant.",-1
5,"What a great find for Indian food!  On a busy Saturday night, the staff at Punjab were welcoming and highly efficient. After just a 15 minute wait, we were shown to a table upstairs where our drink orders were taken shortly after being seated. I had the house red wine, Borsao Garnacha 2014, which lived up to the fruity, full flavor as described on the menu!  Yum!
The vegetable samosas were great as an appetizer with a slightly different sauce than what I've had before, not too sweet, not hot, but flavorful - almost like a barbecue sauce. 
I had the chicken tikka masala and my husband had the Achari Murgha. My dish was tender and flavorful, definitely stood out among the many tikka masalas I've had!  The Achari Murgha was spicy and full of flavor, a completely different set of flavor than either of us had tried before. Both dishes were excellent and were well complemented by the garlic naan. 
We were impressed by the setting, the great food but especially by the service and care taken by the staff. We were greeted by the owner and he took time to speak with us on our way out, too, showing real interest and pleasure in our experience at his restaurant.",1
4,"I arrived here on a Saturday evening for dinner. I was alone and it just took them 3 mins to find a place for me but even for large parties reservation didn't seem to be required.
The service was quick and courteous. I have ordered an Achcari lamb, which I loved -- it had the right amount of spices and it took no time to arrive -- but I think it can still be improved. 
I will go to this place again!",1
5,Amazing curries - definitely try their specialties. Very rich and complex in flavor and the ingredients tasted fresh. Great service and a pleasant dining experience overall.,1
5,We went here for dinner while visiting London and LOVED it!  We got an assortment of dishes that were all great. The service was excellent. The owner was talking to us while we were waiting for a table. My son remarked on how he likes spicy foods so the owner sent over a sample of the Chicken Madras sauce for him to try. This evidently is the spiciest thing on the menu. My son thought it was the best thing he ever tasted!!! We'll crave this yummy place now that we're back in the States!,1
4,It was my first time eating Indian food (as a well as my super picky husband). This place was awesome! We had the chicken tikka misala and tandoori vegetables! They were delicious. The cheese naan was also amazing. We are both hoping that we can find something that is close to this at home!,1
5,"On our nightly wander looking for a place to eat dinner while on vacation my husband and I were planning to hit up Dishoom; however, the line was very, very long and we were very, very hungry. We checked out the map of the area and found Punjab was a quick walk from where we were and, since we were in the mood for Indian, it seemed a good choice. Let me say, I know nothing about Indian food and I have only ever had it twice in my life prior to this, but if I lived in London this would be a go-to, hands down. The food was absolutely delicious and largely sized, the staff actually provided a carafe of water for our table, the drinks were well priced and large, and the staff was friendly, too! I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and I wish I could find something this delicious close to home. My husband ordered one of their spicy dishes and it was definitely spicy (he tried denying this, but the color of his lips told the real story). We also had a flavored naan and the plain rice, both of which were delicious and helped stuff us. We also had no clue that this place was included in a Guy Fieri show, but luckily it wasn't super crowded when we went. Overall, go here. It's delicious, it's filling, it's just what you need if you're looking for Indian food in the Covent Garden neighborhood.",1
3,"recommended by my indian friend as the ""BEST indian food outside of india"" that she's had, Punjab was one of the first restaurants i tried after landing in London
we were pretty underwhelmed by the food 2.5 stars.. but maybe because I didn't order the famed chicken tikka masala
--grandad's daal: BLAND
--lamb korma: this dish was ok
--acharri chicken: too tomatoe-y for my taste
--Garlic naan: pungent but pretty good
--we got one order of Flavored and another order of unflavored rice for the 3 of us
a reasonably priced meal for london
Bill includes a suggested 10% tip
NOTE: the 15 pound minimum order per person is flexible & they only print that on the menu so people don't order solely appetizers",-1
3,"The best parts were the service and the naan. It's a bit of a tourist trap, but almost everything in central London is to some extent, so I can't fault it for that- plus I'm no local either.
After years living in Singapore within a 10-minute walk to Little India for my weekly Indian fix, this was my first taste of classic British style Indian food. I had to try a chicken tikka... and it was ok. I've now been there, done that. Meh. The black dal (Grandad's dal) was ok. And so was the lamb korma. All around average. 
So far in London I preferred Dishoom more, however it is a much more modern restaurant. I opted to take the in-laws here, to Punjab, as I knew it was more traditional restaurant (quiet, good service). Not a bad place at all, but with all the Indian places in London, I'll try somewhere new next time for something more authentic, unusual or innovative.",-1
5,"We arrived with a large group of energetic children for dinner and were seated promptly and courteously. Traveling with children can be met with annoyance. I'm allergic to dairy and my server was incredibly conscientious and helpful in every way, assisting me to find the best dishes to accommodate, and setting the dishes I ordered carefully aside so as to avoid intermixing. Nirag was who helped us. He rushed the food out to help with the children and in every way was so attentive. For the flavors of the food, everything we tried was fantastic!",1
5,Great time with the kids. Good was great as always but I forgot how good the service is. Awesome.,1
3,"We came here on a Wednesday evening for dinner. For a party of 6, the wait time wasn't bad at all - probably only 5 minutes? Anyway, we were seated pretty quickly, which was nice. One thing to note is the seating arrangement felt pretty cramped - separate tables were really close to each other, which made things a bit more uncomfortable.
Since I'm not an expert on Indian food, I let my friends pick our dishes since we were going family style. I think we went with a Chicken Tikka Masala (apparently a classic), Acharri Murgha, Karahi Paneer, and another paneer dish that I've forgotten. For sides, we ordered 3 garlic naans and 3 butter naans. The food took a while to come out, but when it did it all came out at once. Maybe for that reason the dishes weren't as hot as I would've liked them to be, but it was still warm enough.
I'm not the biggest fan of cheese, so the paneer dishes weren't my favorite. I did, however, enjoy the Chicken Tikka Masala! And the other chicken dish was alright, too. The garlic naan was pretty tasty, but it was a bit too oily for my liking. Overall, I thought the meal and experience were just ok - nothing special, but then again maybe that's just because I'm not a huge fan of Indian food to begin with.",-1
5,"Although I am no great expert on food, I think I can tell the difference between meals that come from a can, or a box, and those that come from the hands of a staff that knows what it's doing. The staff at Punjab knows what it's doing. The tikka masala is complex, as is the khorma. By complex I mean that I could taste the separate ingredients working together. My son, who has eaten a lot of Indian cuisine, says it was the best tikka masala he had ever had. Plus the service is relaxed. No one rushed us. This place is well worth a return trip.",1
4,"Excellent food and great service!
We were seated right away and were informed that they needed the table at 7.30 and would we still like to sit. There was ample amount of time to eat so we sat down and looked at the menu. We ordered poppadoms, achari murgha, methi gosht, punjabi chole, rice, and pashwari naan. 
Everything was very yummy and in particular the chole was very tasty. I wish there was a little more heat in the lamb and chicken dish, but I'm sure I can ask for this next time I'm there.
The servers were very attentive. Will defo be back!",1
3,"The food was pretty good, portions not huge and glasses were a bit dirty. Overall it was a good experience, but the waiters were a bit too pushy with drinks and food, continuously suggesting to get double of everything and more of this more of that. If you're in central and craving Indian this is good place",-1
5,"This was my first time in London and my first time having Indian food, and I have got to say, it was delicious! When I get back to New York I have to search for a spot like this. Really cool atmosphere and awesome food. if I'm ever back in London, I will be back at Punjab! Get the butter chicken!",1
5,"One of the best indian food I have ever had. It is no wonder that my colleague recommended Indian food when I told him about my trip to London. I am sold. Bread was warm, every dish we had was tasty, five of us shared our food and we wipe down each plate clean. The server was super friendly and professional, he gave us suggestions since it was our first time there. I saw someone there wearing a really cool sheep t shirt and actually went up to him to ask him where he got the shirt from. Too bad it was from a local market, and I didn't have enough time to go.",1
5,"If I were to pick between Dishoom and Punjab, I think I would pick Panjab. The wait time never exceeds 20 minutes no matter what group size. All dishes are pretty solid, from Lamb Korma, to Acharri Murgha, to Chicken Tikka Masala (just to name a few that I've tried). The Mango Lassi was good. But the mango juice was a bit watered down? I think I'm just used to a more nectar like consistency for mango juices. 
Special shoutout for the Chicken Madras though. The waiter warned me that it's very spicy and I didn't think too much of it. But seriously, never have I ever tasted such a spicy curry, let alone food. I was literally sweating buckets from this. My friends sampled my dish and felt the burn immediately. I think I felt it 1/3 of the way in. I wouldn't say it's a numbing kind of spicy, but more like a slow burn. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the dish. But the strange thing is, I ordered the Lamb Madras a few months later and it wasn't half as spicy as the Chicken Madras? I already ensured my waiter that I can handle my spices... But I guess you really have to emphasize that you want it SPICY SPICY. 
I also like how the waiters throw in freebies every once in a while. My Panjabi friend asked for a Panjab specific bread called bhature, but was told that it's not on the menu. Around 15 minutes later our waiter brought out a basket of bhature specially made for her, free of charge! There was another occasion where I got a plate of papadam accompanied with various chutneys and pickled vegetables, free of charge once again! How awesome is that?! 
Overall great food, fantastic service, and reasonable price. I don't think my expectations for curry will be the same after eating at Punjab. Highly recommend this place!",1
5,"My first time in London, and my first time eating authentic Indian food and what a terrific experience.  The service is great. The servers stand nearby and are waiting to serve you with a smile. The wait was short and the wine was delicious!  I wish California restaurants had the same service.  Bravo!!! One more thing, the manager Agnelo, surprised us with a sparkling desert. What a great guy.  Cheers Agnelo!",1
5,This place was very good. I came here with my family on our way to the British Museum,1
5,"Amazing! Recommend sticking with the items in bold on the menu. We got papadum to start. The main dishes were chicken tikka special (when it comes out they light it on fire on the table!), chicken tandoori and butter chicken. Sides were malai kofta, saag paneer, rice, garlic naan and cheese naan. Everything we had was delicious. 
We also celebrated my parents 30th anniversary. The waiters all signed a card and brought out a nice ice cream dessert with a candle in it. The owner came by at the end to wish them well and see how we enjoyed dinner. We'll be back again :)",1
2,"Manager is up front rushing everyone in and tells you quite bluntly that he has a table but you must be out by a certain time. 
The idea behind it is that he must rotate the tables 2-3 times for dinner, and it shows. Wether the food is good or bad is irrelevant, you can't enjoy it when waiters are staring you down for you to leave! As soon as you put your fork down, they are at your table to clean up. We refused to tell them that we were done, 5 times in less than 7 minutes, just to let our food go down to your stomach,
We were seated in the back room, which has 4 long tables, canteen style. There is a thick carpet in the room and dust accumulates on the black side boards on the walls .. disgusting. 
This place has a lot of potential, but when managed as it is, is just plain sad.
Save your money and go eat somewhere else, there are better places in London.",-1
4,"The ultimate gem of Punjabi food. 
How did miss this! All these years in London wasted!
Unbelievably good. 
Friendly staff with a great sense of humour.
Super fast service and no reservations. You won't have to wait long to be seated.
Trust me, you don't need to reserve here, just walk in anytime.
You might not realise how big this place is until you actually get in and explore it yourself. There are multiple floors and no matter where you sit, you'll have someone around to serve you. 
They serve traditional Punjabi food and some non Punjabi dishes too. 
Unfortunately I was so hungry and seduced by the look of the dishes served in front of me that I forgot to take pictures of them, which I usually do to post to Yelp. And when I started having them, I was in trance, so wasn't aware of much going on. 
One thing I noticed is that this place is filled with tourists and foreigners. Well that explains it. This restaurant is more famous than many others, search the web for ""Oldest Punjabi restaurant in London"" and you'll know. 
I will be eating here many more times. 
They have a wide variety of things on the menu, Punjabi Chicken/Mutton dishes are fabulous, but so are the vegetarian ones, so I hope to try out everything on their menu in the coming few years. 
I so regret the time I spent in London, not knowing this place existed. 
Don't repeat my mistake.",1
3,"The food is good, but not that perfect.
The place a little bit small there is no personal space you can share the conversation with the next table.
Try the chicken masala and chicken butter. And the vegetable and lamb biryani.
And at last don't forget to try the cheese naan.",-1
5,"The best Indian food I've EVER had!!! If you're visiting London, you must go!!!",1
1,Punjab what can I say. Good quality food but Shitty service. We were forgotten(4 tables who arrived after us received their food before us wtf). They also charged our table for an additional naan.....that we never ate)... I never ever write bad reviews but after tonight's dinner I have to. I was so hungry and sad that the staff forgot about our table that I started to tear. Bye punjAb. I'll go to dishoom,-1
5,"Same as others had reviewed, we originally went to Dishoom down the street, but had a 40 minute wait at 10pm. Came here and were blown away by the flavors.  Great service accompanied fantastic food. I highly recommend!",1
2,"Food is okay. Butter chicken ... Meh ... It's alright . And then . Well . Food quality is alright ! It's just the staff Is the reason I downgraded this review from a 4 to a 2. To begin with, in 5 mins , the same waiter asked 3 times : are u ready to order . ( as if I am in his way if I don't ) And when I asked for recommendation and asking what the indian dishes were ( I was searching on my phone earlier ) , and then he fucking took my phone and then did some tapping ( hard!) and then satisfied himself with what he found as a "" bangai"" food pic and then threw my iPhone 6s on the table ! Basically he has used my phone without my permission and Hey ! Throwing it back ! That was raging !! And then when we ordered , me and my friend said one only even after he said it s too small for both of us, and we said no, and when he confirmed the order , he just was like : 2 naan yeh ? I was like ONE !!!!! And then he asked what we want to drink and we don't feel like ordering any beverages but just tap water . He shot this look of "" order so little !"" At us ( at this point , it is pretty subjective ) . Anyways . Got through the end ... And then once they quickly cleared the table , there stood the dessert menu and when we said no , next thing on table was the bill, even we didn't ask for it. We didn't touch the bill for like 2 mins cuz me and my mate were chatting . This staff interrupted and was like : everything alright ? There are people waiting outside . We were very upset by the service . Probably won't go again .  This kind of fast food restaurant is not what we look for and customer service still trumps commercialized food ! Even fast food allows u to sit for awhile. And besides , had better Indian food around the area .",-1
4,"Great Indian restaurant with a very differentiated menu, for every kinda of taste! Excellent quality-price considering that it is settled in the heart of London. Friendly place, excellent both for a dinner with friends or a more serious occasion.",1
4,"Very good food! Actually best food I had in London! 
Service was excellent! Very friendly and polite!",1
5,"My first taste of authentic Indian food was at Punjab and it certainly didn't disappoint! Holy moly, the food amazing and the service was friendly. I ordered the lamb curry (which was extra spicy) and the white rice as well as the chicken tikka and a side of naan bread. Everything was delicious. I dream of the day I get back to London and go over to Covent Garden to get my Indian food fix on.",1
4,"The service was friendly, and the food was delicious. The portions are perfect, had plenty of food. It was very congested inside, very tiny tables with barely any room to walk around, which is probably because so many people are enjoying the great food.",1
5,"Great service and food. The cheese Naan is a must.
No reservation was needed, came in and was sat right away.",1
4,"This two-story restaurant is good, and apparently very established. It is not my favorite by a long shot (try Indian Express in West Kensington), but I would go there again if I was in the area. Service was sufficient, but not as refined as some of the Indian restaurants I've been to recently.
The portions were generous, and the Acharri Ghost (lamb) had delicious flavor without being too hot, although the lamb itself was just a bit tough. The Chicken Tikka Masala was good as well. I really liked the Grandad's Kali Dall, and I ladled it over my Pilau Rice to form a great concoction. I have no idea if this is the proper way to eat it, but it worked nicely and nobody kicked me out.
Long story short, this place can leave you walking away happy, but I can't guarantee that you'll fall in love.",1
5,I always visit the Punjab whenever I go to London. Did is always good and service outstanding. The Methi Lamb is my personal favourite. I would not go anywhere else in central London.,1
5,"Excellent food, amazing service, authentic and reliable quality food.",1
4,This restaurant was recommended by many on a recent trip. It was good but for sure did not live up to the hype. Service was excellent but food lacked spices and depth. If you like blander food this is the spot for you.,1
3,"Good food with decent service. You won't be sorry you came but there's probably some better Indian in london , they did have air conditioning during the heat wave in london while we were there. 
If you're nearby its worth the eat.",-1
5,"So so so good! Cool looking space, very clean and seems like they have two waiters per table, so you are well taken care of. Very reasonable prices if not on the cheaper side for the high quality. I will for sure be back!",1
3,"We wanted to go to Homeslice around the corner but the wait was too long and so decided to go here instead since there was sort of a small queue and we always passed by it wanting to try it out. The food is good. The daal Makhani tastes like my moms and that almost brought tears to my eyes :') the service is O-Kay at best and the ambience is also a bit strange. Overall good food, but I don't know if I'll go back again!",-1
2,"Decent food. Rude and curt staff. Didn't check in one between ordering food and drinks and when I asked for the bill. When I asked for the bill, the waiter finally asked if I wanted I refill on my drink which I had finished 20 minutes earlier. There are better places in London with less entitled staff.",-1
4,"Sometimes it's easy to forget what a great Indian meal is when there is so much mediocre out there. Glad to say that after tonight I have been reminded again. Their no reservation system works because their service is so efficient, so even though it was Friday and they were rammed, we didn't wait too long. Food was very tasty, chicken succulent, sauces just right without relying on over spicing and naan supper fresh. A great curry house in the centre of theatre district - but given that it's been going since 1946 you probably don't need me to tell you that.",1
4,"Very friendly welcome and attentive service for my family of 5 children under 13yrs old on a busy Friday night at 8:30pm. So thankful!!! Great depth of flavor in every dish we tried - butter chicken, tikka masala, black lentil dal, samosas, mango lassis, even the cheese naan. A bit too spicy for my kids after growing accustomed to our favorite Indian in blandly spiced Germany. Easy to get to from Tube station nearby.",1
3,"We came here based on the reviews and proximity to our hotel.
I enjoyed the food here but not sure if it's the best Indian curry I've ever had. I know there's many types of curries from different regions but I guess Punjab is not my favorite. It's a little too tomatoe-y for my taste.
I've never been to an Indian restaurant where I had to pay extra for white rice. The rice usually comes with the curry. And not only that but when we got the bill, the rice was 3 pounds so that's about $5 USD for just white rice. We ordered two. If we had known, I would have gotten more naan instead. Some of the naan were cheaper than white rice.
The service was ok. Nothing great.
The place seemed pretty touristy. No one at the nearby tables were English. They were either Japanese, American or Swedish (?).",-1
4,"We ordered the butter chicken along with chicken marsala accompanied by rice and naan, of course. I really enjoyed the butter chicken, it had flavor but I definitely wouldn't consider it ""spicy."" I will admit that I don't have the most refined Indian pallette in the world but the chicken marsala sauce tasted much like the sauce in a can of SpaghettiOs if we're being honest. 
The service from the staff was excellent. They seated us immediately and made sure we were always looked after. 
The meal was relatively costly for what I expected, about £35 for the two of us.",1
5,Came here cus I saw it on TV. I have 0 regrets! Service great and the food so so tasty! Id love to go back! And i will!,1
4,"This had the best chicken tikka masala that i've ever had. Real good service in a nice part of town. Excellent. Wife had the muhtar paneer, which was also very good. The samosas leave something to be desired, but other than that, its brilliant!",1
4,"Coming off a disappointing curry house the night before, I was hopeful my experience at Punjab would turn things around. It did.
The food was amazing. I had Grandad's Kali Daal, and even though I'm not normally a vegetarian, I was blown away by this meal. It was rich, not overly creamy (most likely yogurt-based), and perfectly cooked. The lentils were firm to the bite but thoroughly stewed. The naan was the right balance of pliable, but crunchy. Even the plain basmati rice I ordered was perfectly cooked.
The service was punctual, but as others have noted, it could have been friendlier. The waitstaff wasn't rude, just cold and non-interactive. I would have given Punjab 5-stars had the service been better. But everyone there was so aloof, I docked them a star just on that one aspect.
The interior is intimate and cozy. Nothing mind-blowing but very relaxing.
All-in-all, Punjab restaurant is well worth the visit if you're seeking a well-priced, authentic, delicious stop on your culinary tour of London.",1
4,"Went with wife and daughter last week while visiting from US.  Food was Tip Top, I had the chicken tika masala which was tender and tasty.  Wife had butter chicken which she enjoyed.  Duaghter enjoyed her eggplant dish,  Apps were delicious and plentiful.  Highlight of the meal was the Naan, which had coconut and dried fruit.  When we return this summer to London I plan on going back.",1
4,"3.5 stars.
So Saturday around 7:45 pm for a table of 2 there was only about a 10 minute wait. My recommendation is to book in advance for sure no matter what party size you are because why not? The line can get quite long and it isn't entirely predictable, so might as well be safe.
Shortly after we got in the line, it became quite long quite quickly. A group of about 10 behind us was told it would be a 1.5 - 2 hour wait.
Now the people here are mostly fun and jovial. There are a couple of servers who were a bit cold and impatient, but generally speaking people are smiley and friendly. The expediter at the front who passes the dishes to the servers is super friendly. 
The food here is really interesting - you'll see things here that they don't have elsewhere and vice versa. I would recommend actually going with a Punjabi dish here instead of something you can get anywhere (like a generic tikka masala or korma). 
We went with the acharri murgha and chicken malai tikka.
Acharri Murgha - an classic Punajbi pickle-style chicken, medium spiced, and a bit tangy. Now let me say a word about the ""pickle-style"" - the sauce is flavoured with pickles in the cooking process, but there are no actual pickles in it. The pickle taste is also certainly not overwhelming, which I was really afraid of. This was a delicious, unique, flavorful dish and I would highly recommend it. I haven't tasted much like it before and I would absolutely get it again.
Chicken Malai Tikka - chicken breast marinated with cream, cheese, and yoghurt, cooked in the tandoori and served sizzling with onions on a skillet. This dish was just ok, but nothing special. I expected much more from the dish. The chicken was super soft, tender, and creamy, but there wasn't a lot of flavour and it wasn't interesting.
The hariyali chicken tikka really caught my eye, but I was too afraid to try it because it's apparently a very very strong coriander taste (with some mint as well) and some of the servers seemed to think it could be overwhelming.
We also got steamed rice and naan, which I wouldn't say was one of the better ones I've had.
Overall though, I was very happy with the meal, the staff, and the acharri. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try.",1
3,"I do not know what all the hype is about. We had a reservation and were seated in a lovely room. When the food came we were shocked to see only 1 naan for 2 people. That's just weird. 
I ordered the Tikka chicken and it was OK, it wasn't anything to write home about. It was just OK. It was so quiet during lunch that it really was no fun. 
I will never go back again. Keep your hype, I'll just go to my amazing neighbourhood place that's yet to be discovered.",-1
4,"While on my first ever trip in London, I felt the experience could not be complete without an Indian food tasting.  The English food had thus far proved to be a mediocre affair, but I had heard great things about the Indian food.  While strooling through Covenant Gardens I noticed many street signs attempting to lure tourist into other Indian restaurants; Punjab did not engage in this practice but I was lured to it all the same.
Punjab is a fourth generation family owned restaurant and bears the title of being the oldest Punjabi restaurant in England, which I think is very cool.  The menu is quite extensive with over 100 different options to try and each choice complete with is own colorful description about how succulent the dish is.  And, the food was amazing.  I ordered the Acharri Murgha because it was quoted as a once in a lifetime experience, and I have nothing to say against it.  Also, props go the management who provided my mother with an off the menu version of chicken tikka that was free of spice sicne she cannot tolerate any.
The pricing is expensive and all naan and rice is done a la carte which add to the price.  The beer, however, is reasonable.  I had a Cobra, it complemented the dishes.",1
5,"Excellent chicken tikka masala. Definitely one of the better restaurants in London. However, must get there early to beat the crowd. Very clean and quaint.",1
5,"Wanted to go to Dishoom but they don't take reservations for under 6 people and despite being told that they turn around tables quickly, there was an hour long line outside. That's just a huge waste of time so we Yelped nearby and settled on Punjab. Glad we did because it was several plates full of awesome.
There were three of us and we ordered the right amount of food: two chicken dishes, two veggie dishes, rice and naan. We even had desert. Everything was excellent including the pickles for the popadoms.
I am very pleased that they had air conditioning upstairs since it would otherwise have been unbearably hot.",1
3,"Food was tasty, but service was lacking.
I got the butter chicken and the saag paneer.  The butter chicken was as advertised, two pieces of bone-in chicken smothered in a creamy butter sauce.  The saag paneer had a decent kick to it.  I saw someone get the chicken tikka special, I think I will get that next time with a side of masala as one of the other reviewers recommended.
Worth a stop if your unsure which quick Indian place you want to jump into.",-1
2,"We dined at this restaurant after freshly arriving from Paris to London for the first time.  We looked for good Indian restaurants on Yelp! and this was a well reviewed one.  We had a 20 minute walk from the hotel to this place and decided to stop for a fruit juice on the way (my wife was starving and it was hot).  As soon as we got into the restaurant, one of the server rudely said ""No outside drinks allowed"".  And then continued to tell us that we can go drink it outside and come back.  When I say rudely, I mean he was kind of ordering us and making us feel uncomfortable as if we just sneaked a drink in at the Movie Theater.  So that was a bad first impression.  
The Menu looked good though.  Much more choices than usual.  I ordered Kadai Chicken with Garlic Naan and my wife ordered some Yellow Daal with Chappati.  The Daal, Chappati, and the Garlic Naan were good.  The Kadai Chicken, on the other hand, was really bad.  I could barely bite into the chicken it was so hard.  
After our first bad impression, the service was not bad.  I think it is important to treat your customers with respect and ""ask"" them to ""please"" refrain from bringing outside drinks instead of ordering them and making them feel uncomfortable in front of other customers.
The food that was good was average.  The food that was bad really takes the rating down another star.  And the outside drink incidence takes down another star.",-1
5,"After two days in London on vacation, my mother and I experienced one of the most incredible meals. Punjab is not to be missed. Right around the corner from the hotel and pretty centralized to everything else (such as Covent Garden and Holborn) it is incredible. 
We had chicken tikka masala which was fantastic, garlic naan that was soft, crunchy and delicious, and another type of chicken coated in mint and coriander. It came out sizzling, warm and tender. Perfect. Why hadn't we come here earlier?
Highly recommend this place for anyone local or anyone visiting the area. Oh and the service is outstanding. Attentive and patient. Gets the job done. A+",1
4,"My family and I were looking for some great indian food on our recent trip to London, but didn't want to make the trek to Whitechapel. Thanks to yelp, we found Punjab in a fantastic location near Oxford st. The place was busy, and we were seated right away even though we didn't have a reservation. The servers were nice, and the food was great. Definitely order the butter chicken (although our bowl only had two pieces of chicken). We ordered the garlic naan, despite the funny tip on the menu. The garlic isn't really as strong as the menu warns, so I wouldn't worry about not getting any action after the meal! 
I would definitely return!",1
5,Every time I'm in London this is a must stop for a terrific Indian meal. Service is always great and why I've been coming back for 10+ years.,1
4,"If you are craving a curry in Central London, this is probably your best bet.  Lamb chops came sizzling to the table. Tasty!",1
5,"I had the best Indian food I had ever had here and had a wonderful experience. We chose this restaurant based on its good Yelp reviews, and we were not disappointed. When we got to the restaurant, we were greeted by the owner. He asked us where we were from and then gave us his suggestions on what we should order. His suggestions did not disappoint! I will definitely come back next time I am in London. Overall, delicious food, excellent staff, welcoming owner, amazing dining experience.",1
4,"We really enjoyed this restaurant! 
This was our first meal in London and we had heard that London has some great Indian food. We wanted to go to Dishoom, but couldn't get in. In retrospect, we are glad we landed on this place. 
We were able to get in without a reservation. The bartender that greets customers as they walk in was very friendly. The service was excellent. We had 3 waiters/servers for our table of two. 
The food came out speedy fast. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and my girlfriend ordered Chicken Tandoori. We were both very pleased. It was very tasty. We also had an order of the garlic naan which was standard. 
The prices were reasonable (just under £30 for two). I would definitely recommend Punjab to anyone that is in the London area and in the mood for Indian food.",1
5,"Food was great. The service for London was attentive and quick. The prices were reasonable. Didn't love the wine, but that was probably a bad selection on my end.",1
3,"Food is ok. Nothing to write home about. They charge for every little thing e.g pappad, rice. The entree are at a higher price range and they dont even include rice. Roti or naam coats about £2.50 each just to give an idea. Rice is also not cheap. The ambience and service is just ok. I dont't think I'll be going back.",-1
4,"Touted as UK's oldest North Indian restaurant, Punjab is really just upscale Indian food. There are variations on the naan and the basmati rice is overpriced, but you can't argue with the well cooked curry. My acharri gosht was perfectly cooked and the lamb was tender. While my brain was telling me that cottage cheese did not belong in gravy, butter, and cream, the paneer makhani was delicious and tasted more like tofu. The prices were a bit high for what you get, but at least the food tasted good.",1
4,"I've been here a few times and it's always busy.  The food is pretty tasty. However  It is standard 
 North Indian fare with a few unusual dishes thrown in.  We had chicken Madras,  chicken Korma  and a couple of veggie dishes-saag aloo and mushroom masala.  I  asked for the Madras to be extra hot. Usually this can result in a psychotic chef's revenge by emptying the entire tub of chili powder in the dish,  or alternatively  it remains resolutely pretty mild.  This Madras was bang on.   The food was very well put together.  It does what it says on the tin.  Prices are a little high though.  Service is harassed though reasonably friendly.  You can do a lot worse than the Punjab,  though if you're looking for more cutting edge Indian food then look elsewhere.",1
1,"The food was fine, but if you are a tourist, check your bill carefully.  I was overcharged and thought that the bill was a little high when it was presented to me, but was in a rush to leave.  When I got back to the hotel, I had a bad feeling about the bill and checked the prices of what I ordered online.  Sure enough, I was overcharged,  It could have been a mistake, but I truly do not believe that it was.  Unfortunately, I paid cash, otherwise, I would go back to the restaurant to get my money back.  It's the principle,  I hate dishonesty.",-1
5,"So a disclaimer - I don't know the difference between good or great Indian food, or even what regional Indian foods should taste like. 
However what I can say, is that my family and I had an excellent experience here. We came here based off the reviews from more knowledge food folk, and the quality of service, food and the general restaurant environment was all top notch. Our server was helpful, and our choices were all satisfactorily spicy/not spicy. They were also happy to keep our box of leftovers in their kitchen while we went off to the theater. 
The other option would have been Dishoom, but I'm glad we didn't go there - the atmosphere at this place is really nice, and Dishoom just seems like it's trying too hard. plus their no reservations policy is a little objectionable.
Punjab gets a well deserved 5 stars.",1
4,"Food was good, not great.  Service was prompt,  but not personal.   Get in, get out!  Also, if you don't say anything,  an ""optional service 10"" charge is added...I'm guessing for tip?   Also, what the hell, rice costs $3.30!!!  It's good rice,  but it's freaking rice!",1
5,"So, this was the only Indian restaurant we went to in London, but my god was it the best Indian food I've ever eaten. No where I've ever been on the west coast (of America) can hold a candle to this place. We ended up going for dinner 2 out of the 4 nights we were in London! If you get there before 6pm for dinner, you won't have to wait in their line outside.",1
1,"I'll start off by first ditto'ing Rick G's comment on the putrid stench.
Second, wtf?? How is this place rated so highly? Saying the best dishes we tried were even mediocre would be flattery. Blegh. The chicken tikka masala was- ok. And that was the best we had. The spinach both tasted disgusting and was completely unappetizing to look at. You have to pay for rice. The tandoori was bland and boring. 
SO very disappointed to have wasted my one night out in London at Punjab.
And again, the chemical odor, ugh. Voila, my first one-star review.",-1
5,"Delicious food, great atmosphere albeit slightly packed when you're sitting at the back like we did. My favourite Indian restaurant in London!",1
5,"I visited Punjab for the second time last night and was not disappointed. The place is hopping on a Saturday night, with plenty of tourists, but we waited less than five minutes for a table. The chana masala was amazing, even my dining companions were jealous. The food prices are reasonable and the wine prices remarkably low. On my first visit, service was a bit brusque, but last night they redeemed themselves. I wholeheartedly recommend Punjab!",1
1,"Incompetent. Made a reservation for 7 people at 9:15pm. Had a long conversation, the man took the booking, wrote down my phone number and wrote down my name (even asked me to spell it). 
When we arrived, the man acted like we never made the reservation while my party of 7 waited outside. They claimed they dont make reservations. Complete utter disregard for us. Yelled at and everything. Avoid just to not support this business.",-1
4,"Great service Agnelo AKA Michael and The Governor who we had a lovely conversation with about the history of the restaurant.
Prices are like an normal sit down middle priced place in London. I've averaged 45 Pounds for 2 anywhere in London. Lets put it this way I would rather spend that 45 pounds here, good value.
We had Butter chicken which was made with real bone-in tandoori chicken (the right way to make it) Delicious.
Also ordered the Achari lamb which was equally great and I found my self ordering more Naan to clean up what left in the dish :)
So if you are in the Covent garden area and want some nice indian cuisine then this is your place.
BTW: Chemical Odder other reviewers talked about wasnt that noticeable but I caught it too.  
I think comes from the bathroom, I bet you all were sitting in the hall between the bathroom and the main door. The one on your right when you enter. I think the draft between the bathroom and the front door opening delivers the smell. At least you know that the bathrooms are clean :)",1
4,"A lovely place in Coventry Garden. Dropped in for dinner and got seated straight away. They did let us know they needed the table for guest coming in a few hours, no worries. Had classic Indian form tikka to sagg paneer. Non disappointed and would make a return visit next time we come through.",1
4,"Coming to London, one has to sample the curries. Punjab was perfect. Great service, great ambience, great food. And, the place has been open since 1946.
I ordered the Lamb Saag and the chicken tikka special. I always order chicken tikka and think I am getting a nice curry sauce with it, and it always comes out without the masala sauce. So I ordered this sauce on the side with the special dish. 
So the dish is prepared at your table with the server drizzling some alcohol over the chicken tikka dish, which comes out on a sizzling hot plate. The guy lights the alcohol on fire!!!! It's perfect.
The Cheese Naan was not as good as I hoped.
The guy didn't charge me for the Masala sauce.",1
4,"Delicious traditional Indian fare. The restaurant is busy so book in advance. The menu is hilarious - see the Garlic Naan description. Indian cuisine is one of my favourites - this stood up well. Go with a group, as portions are large and you need to try a few dishes.",1
5,"Undoubtedly, one of the best North Indian restaurants in London. I usually order mango lassi in every Indian restaurant. But decided to try salted lassi this time and I was not disappointed. It was perfect. I tried different kinds of breads(bullet naan, chapathi and tandoori paratha), kaali dal and masala chai. It was heavenly. The service was very quick. And the waiting time for a table wasn't bad. We went there on New Year's eve and I thought we would have to wait for a long time to get a table. But, we got a table as soon as we walked in. The staff were very friendly. I would definitely go there again to try the rest of the dishes!",1
4,"We went there with a couple of friends: the food is exquisite, but quite spicy so be ready. Got the chicken tikka masala, daal, garlic naan, rice pilau. Everything was perfectly cooked and it wasn't that expensive: around 20£ per person",1
1,Most racist place.. Went for dinner there with family and friends and it looks like they like to cater only to English people ... Serving Indian people in A Indian restaurant is below their dignity .. The owner was disrespectful and inappropriate with even kids. Just appalling behavior !!! Honestly just full of ..: !!!! Don't waste ur money n time to bear the humility from these dumb racist idiots.,-1
4,"Tasty Indian food in London at a reasonable price. All 3 of us enjoyed our dinners here. I had Chicken Madras which was hotter that I've had at other restaurants. That's not a complaint because it tasted great; just HOT! The chicken was breast meat and prepared well.
We also liked the Punjabi Samosa and Chicken Tikka Masala, and Garlic Naan. 
Friendly, efficient staff help make the dining experience pleasant. I'd be happy to come back here again when I'm in London.",1
4,"Not the best chicken korma in the world but the service was so nice and friendly (I ate solo and was happy as a clam) and the pilau rice was great.
Oh yeah, the tandoori wings were pretty good too.",1
4,"The food was delicious. I would stop in again on my trip if I didn't still have leftovers - and if it wasn't for the 15 pound/person minimum they list in small text on the bottom of the menu. For a meal there is no worry about teaching the minimum between an entrée, rice (or bread) and a drink. It's worth it, too. 
I waited until a waiter brought me a box for my leftovers to ask for a masala chai and that order was lost. Another waiter brought me the bill and I did not check it for the chai - which occasioned many minutes afterward of curious stares as the staff wondered why I wasn't leaving and I wondered how long it took to make a chai. After a bit I asked a server, who got pretty flustered, checked my bill, and in the end have me a free glass of chai so no complaints.",1
5,Great little restaurant near the Lion King theatre. Super quick service and an unbeatable price. Loved it!,1
3,"Okay, very underwhelmed by the food here.  Came here by myself for dinner based on the generally positive yelp reviews here and not sure if I feel like this place delivers.  Started out with an appetizer of the amritsari fish, then had the main dish of acharri murgha with some plain naan, with a mango lassi to wash it all down.  Yes, food was generally tasty but definitely did not live up to the hype of the amazing quality of British Indian food.  As an example, the fish tasted like it was just thawed frozen fish fried with some spices.  Nothing was bad at all, and I had a generally good dinner, but nothing at all was special.  I've had much better Indian food in a number of restaurants in NYC.  Also, just as a slight aside, I think almost every customer in the restaurant was a tourist, which while not always indicative of anything, in the context of my lackluster meal, does not bode well for the quality of the food. 
That being said, I had no issues with the service of the wait staff.  Everyone was polite and attentive and I did not feel rushed out at any point.",-1
3,"They have very good food and excellent service. Very tasty dishes with excellent curries. 
They need to update their restaurant, it's rather poor shape but it shouldn't stop you from going if you want good Indian food",-1
1,"Met a friend here this August, expected a tourist trap given its location, only to find them trying not to be even that. Their claim to authenticity is in their lack of customer service for anybody non-white. Food was mostly horrible, and I do not use the word ""horrible"" lightly. Only the uninitiated will find this close to Indian cooking. Unfortunately, we are spoiled by Delhi's Gulatis, Karims and any number of choices in SFO bay area.
Our meal started with Dry Kebabs that were dry and reheated. Excess of food coloring in CTM and shrimp was rubbery. Their Daal and recommended veggies(we had eggplant) were particularly bland and undercooked. Naan was ok..All in all looked like it was cook's first day at work. Servers were more interested in upping the check and getting us to leave even though we over ordered for six. Do not waste your time and money here, London can do better.",-1
5,"This was a great restaurant. No wait (despite not having a reservation), super food and considerate service, with reasonable prices. 
I really enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Special, which came out sizzling and seasoned just right. Garlic Naan was very tasty as well.",1
4,"Very good and expensive Indian restaurant. 
Perfect service.
Very busy, so better reserve early.",1
5,"Inexpensive yet delicious. I have read the reviews and heard people rave about this place for eons, and when I finally made my way in there, it did not disappoint.
The food was wonderful, the waiters were attentive and friendly, the price was very reasonable. The restaurant itself is pretty small and decorated with pictures of the family who own it and with some photos of the maharajahs (I think - it could have just been a really extravagant school uniform), which was a nice touch.
If you like Indian food, definitely go here",1
5,"As always, very good.  We always visit the Punjab when in London.  The food is excellent, and the service is wonderful.  We are never disappointed.  This time we took some friends, and they were impressed too!  The house specialties are outstanding.",1
4,We had a very late lunch (or early dinner?) around 4:30 here. Loved their cheese naan! Favorite naan in all of London so far!,1
5,Outstanding is the one word to describe this place. Food beverage and staff all receive high marks.,1
4,Great authentic indian food for very reasonable prices. No queues. A good recommendation.,1
4,Great lamb curries and roast chicken.,1
3,"Having been in London for a few months now upon writing this review, I must start off by saying that I've really fallen in love with the Indian cuisine offered in the city, however, as a result, I'm beginning to grow a bit more critical when reviewing Indian as I learn to understand it better.
To start off, Punjab provides customers with a great atmosphere for dining.  Located right at the end of Neal Street in Covent Garden, Punjab is a great place to go after a bit of shopping or after work.  Additionally, the service is absolutely fantastic, with quick and funny waiters who are more then willing to help should you find yourself in a bind as to what dish to have (and you will!)
As for the food, however, Punjab falls just a tad bit short when taking into consideration that you'll likely pay around 12 pounds if you get a dish with rice and naan.  The serving sizes are a tad bit small (certainly too small to split) for what you pay, and having sampled a bit from the dishes of those around me, I found that the seasoning was pretty much the same even with dishes that were drastically different from one another.  
If you're in it for the atmosphere, Punjab is a great choice, but if you're really trying to get the best bang for your buck I might consider looking elsewhere.",-1
5,"Let me start by pointing out that I have an increasingly large Italian friendship base, and one thing that Italian's (in my experience) can't really handle is the classic, mouth melting curry. It took me roughly 11 months to convince my partner that this really was a good place to go, and she's glad I did. The only problem I now have is that I have to argue extensively so that I don't have curry every Friday night.
The Punjab is pretty close to a tourist heavy area - not necessarily a bad thing, but the obvious fears of quality/authenticity are apparent. Within 30 seconds of sitting down though, the fears are instantly dispelled. The staff are beyond friendly, the recommendations really strong and most importantly REALLY descriptive. It made it very easy for my partner to pick what type of curry would be best for her (surprisingly not the Korma) and which starters would enable her to be a little more adventurous (she had the pokora, which were the ""right type of spicy"").
Beyond the food, the wine selection is, if anything, slightly luxurious for a curry house (I staunchly stuck to my cobra) and received no complaints from my partner, a minor miracle in itself. The best thing about the Punjab for me though is the atmosphere and the place itself. It's a proper curry house - it doesn't set out to be a really pretentious and ultra-modern environment, where you're served minimal portions in a stylish fashion, and it doesn't pander to touristy gimmicks - it's basically like a freshly decorated version of your local curry house - clean, warm and friendly. 
You will need to book for Friday and weekend slots, and it's always worth trying to get yourself a table on the left side of the restaurant where the atmosphere is a little bit more cosy (and the seating against the walls is a bit comfier than the normal seats). To the right is the primary room, which is great if you have a large group or if you are there on the busier nights, but on an early weekday or early in the day, you can get a little bit lost in the space and feel a little isolated. Beyond that, get the vegetable samosas every time, because the dark red/brown sauce that it comes with is the best thing on the menu.",1
5,"Real taste of North Indian food. Delicious lamb. If you want to try real Indian food, aromatic, full of flavour, that's the best choice. Highly recommend.",1
4,"Indian food of the highest quality with service to match.  Well priced to boot.  The only downside was a wait of about 20 minutes as I failed to book a table ahead of time.
Since my dining companion is spice averse, we ordered fairly benign dishes.  On this night, we had the butter chicken, samosas, cholay and garlic naan.  The butter chicken might have been the best I've had.  There was a wonderful smoky component to the chicken that came through despite the rich, luxurious sauce.  That sauce, well, I could have drunk that from a cup it was so good.  As it was, I tried to soak up every last drop with the freshly baked naan.
Service was extremely attentive, with the manager coming around a few times to check up on us.
Punjab was been around for about 60 years, and it's easy to see why.  In a city that prides itself on the quality if its Indian food, I feel that Punjab is definitely amongst the upper crust.",1
5,"Hands down my favorite Indian restaurant in Covent Garden!  IThis review is from when I visited a few years back, but the memories of the meal were like yesterday.
We didn't have any reservation when we arrived, and it was a cold rainy London day.  We got a nice seat, away from the door, and proceeded to order.  I chose the tandoori chicken platter and it did not disappoint. The chicken was very tender and perfectly spiced.  The naan was also great as was the raita.
The entire dining experience was fabulous.  Service was fantastic and the other diners in the restaurant were very friendly.  I want to come back to London and visit this fine establishment!",1
5,"Good was great and prices were fair. We enjoyed the chicken tikka masala (each our own order!), samosas, paratha and garlic naan. Great service.",1
4,"Methi Gosht was incredible as was the service and presentation. The manager came to our table to check up on everything and recommended to get Methi Gosht with Paratha instead of with Naan. A great choice.
The Acchari Murgh was good but not as good as the Methi Gosht.
We ordered two desserts and they served Kulfi and Gulab Jaman just the way we liked it. 
A wonderful dining experience.",1
4,"I'm torn on this one. I feel like it was four star food but a three star experience. The ambiance was very strange and it was overpriced. The food was prepared very well, the naan was tasty, the jalfrezi was exactly the right amount of spicy. But I'm not accustomed to paying nearly £4 for rice or naan. If you're in the area and looking for an Indian place to duck into, this is a reliable option, though not the cheapest for what it  is. 
They give you lollies with your bill, which strangely really excited me. I will give the experience four stars overall on account of the incredible menu descriptions. In particular, check out the garlic naan description and the brief paragraph under the Lamb Curry heading.",1
4,"I've walked past this place for years, always considering it as somewhere that was likely to be a tourist trap. Glad I finally considered it as had quite a delicious meal.
I definitely recommend that you treat yourself to some Poppadoms as the green mystery sauce they come with is really tasty, whatever it is.
 I picked one of their 'traditional' options, I forget the name. It was really nice as were the chapathi and the chilli naan that accompanied it.
All washed down with a pleasant Cava. Nice all round meal.",1
4,"After attempting to make a trip to Little India, we made a quick decision to get back on the tube after our mission had failed (the area didn't look safe for women to walk around at night), so we re-routed and decided to go to Punjab which was our 2nd choice after reading reviews on Yelp. I'm glad that we did! We really enjoyed this quaint restaurant. Our friends raved about the Indian food in London, so eating at an Indian restaurant in London was a must on our to-eat list.
{ORDER}
* Chicken Tandoori - the best chicken tandoori! The meat literally melted in your mouth, it was oh-so-soft!
* Butter Naan - after trying the regular naan, we decided to get the butter naan after seeing the table next to us ordering multiple baskets. We loved it! The butter made a huge difference and made the naan very moist.
{DON'T ORDER}
* Acharri Murgha Chicken Curry - we weren't impressed with the flavors and the pickled, tangy flavored was unexpected and ruined it for me.
* Garlic Naan - too dry
* None of their desserts - the wanna-be carrot cake came out super hot and did not resemble anything like American carrot cake. It felt like eating mushy carrots. The other dessert, not sure what it was called but it was in a white liquid form was a huge disaster. 
{ENVIRONMENT}
* Great service
* Quaint, clean restaurant
* Located in Convent Garden (safe area, lots of retails)
Punjab is UK's oldest Indian restaurant. That tells you something. They're doing something right!",1
1,"I recently spent several days in London and wanted to eat some great Indian Food.  Looking at Yelp, Punjab seemed to be among the best so we decided to give it a try.  I won't say it's the worst Indian food I've ever eaten.  No, it's truly mediocre.  Dry, flavorless naan, poor quality rice, bland dal... everything you'd expect from a mediocre Indian restaurant.  I hope those who thought this was the ""Best freaking Indian food"" get a chance to eat at better places.  They can start a few blocks away, at Dishoon (it's not the best Indian food I've had, but definitely better).
What makes Punjab one star, though, is the painfully strong odor of industrial strength soap that permeated ever nook and cranny of the place.  And after sitting in that horrid stench for an hour, it also permeated every nook and cranny of my skin and clothes.  The crazy thing is that this soapy smell seems to be the result of some towels that they give you at the end of the dinner, so you can clean your hands.  Or maybe, so you can get a chemical peel.  Either way, it was ridiculous and it totally ruined any chance we might have had to enjoy our meal.
There are many more Indian restaurants in London.  Give some of them a try instead of this place.",-1
5,"AMAZING!! Honesty some of the best Indian food I've yet to enjoy and in such an awesome location. 
First, we got lost and looped around from the Covent Garden station to Neal Street. Not really sure how that happened, but we loved walking around, it's such a funky and fun area. Finally we found it and were greeted by such a nice gentleman who kept joking around with my boyfriend and I. From the instant the door opened you could smell a variety of divine spices and we knew that this place was going to be great.
We ordered chicken tikka massala, mixed chicken tandoori, a lamb curry I can't remember the name, plain naan, garlic naan, and white wine. SO GOOD! Will definitely be going back again. Great charm with good service and amazing food. Can't really get much better than that. It was a little pricier than expected but definitely worth it. Get there sooner than later or you'll be waiting outside because this place is so popular! 
I found the reviews here on yelp to be very helpful so thank you to you all who have enjoyed it and GO FOR IT for those of you who haven't!",1
4,Delish. Fantastic garlic naan and chicken tiki masala. Overall good service. We dined on a Monday evening and sat upstairs. Quaint location,1
2,"This was the most bland indian food we have ever eaten. Did they run out of spices tonight? The black daal, a recommended dish, just tasted like cream and beans. The paneer was too dense and bland. The stuffed eggplant was really good, but that was the only standout dish.",-1
5,No need to wait 2 hours for Dishoom's. 5 minutes up the street. Excellent service. Started with Garlic naan and cheese naan- very good. Had chicken acchari muggers and chicken madras-both excellent. Chicken tandoori was moist.,1
5,"We had a great expiriencie, for us it was the best indian food we had in London. We ordered the lamb karma, chiken tika masala, rice with cumin and the garlic naan. Not only the food was good but the service was great.",1
4,"We were looking for British-style Indian food and this place was great. Prompt friendly service and really tasty food.
This is a popular place but they hold aside some tables for walk-ins. I think if you go right at 8pm once all the theatergoers are gone you should be able to get a table.
Rice and naan are a la carte but that seems to be the custom in London.",1
4,Butter chicken was my best meal in London two years ago. Enjoyed their variety of beers as well. The neighborhood is fun to walk and offers several great options. This is one of the best.,1
1,"UK's oldest North Indian restaurant serves perhaps the oldest and driest Tandoori meat. 
I must say to the 4 of us visiting this restaurant this came as a shock as it has gotten tons of high marks. The seehk kebab was as dried as the chilly used in it, the Boti kebab was chewy as an old dried leather belt and the Tandoori chicken bland. Chicken tikka on the tandoori menu was the only piece of meat that was somewhat up to the standard. In general the tandoori menu felt not tender nor marinated long enough. 
Butter chicken or Acharri gosht are the items to go for, but then again they are no better than much less exclusive and less up-scaled Indian restaurants in London. 
The portions, and we are not Americans, were too small for the price asked. Basmati rice and nan are good but nowhere as good as the prices indicate  nor are they any better than other Indian restaurants. 
The service is okay but deceiving, they do love to accommodate but they also love to sell and perhaps the worst I seen in London happened here when spring water bottle could not be opened at the table because it was ""slippery"" but conveniently  was replaced in the bar with another bottle which had already been opened. This is one of the oldest tricks in the book and at these prices and with this reputation  it shouldn't take place here. 
For a party of four and only 2 bottle of beers being the only alcoholic beverages served the sum of 114£ is much more well spend somewhere ells than Punjab.",-1
5,"Delicious, authentic and priced right! We ordered samosas, tikka masala, methi Murgha (subtle with a nice kick at the end), and of course butter naan and Keema naan.  It's location in Coventry Garden is ideal for a great meal.",1
5,"Pick anything on the menu and it will be the best Indian food you have ever had. Well worth waiting in line for a table. If you don't eat at Punjab while in London, you are doing yourself a disservice.",1
5,"Fantastic!! Butter Chicken...butter Naan
Enough said.",1
5,Absolutely delicious!!! Must go to for Indian food. The cheese naan and chicken curry is absolutely delicious!,1
1,I do not recommend this place. it is very small and one the starters came I found three little hairs. they took the dish away and remove the hairs. Again I would not recommend.,-1
4,Dependable Indian in the heart of the West End. I've been going here for years and the place is almost always packed. Its good solid indian food and very quick service. The decor won't win any awards and its not fancy. But sometimes you want tried and true.,1
4,"Brits know how to curry, and Punjab is tops. We went for the English classics like chicken tikka masala with lots of buttery naan - sublime. Perfect after a busy morning at the British Museum, and before exploring the nearby bookstores.",1
4,nice Indian/Pakistani food restaurant in London.  All the food were great. Good service and good ambience.,1
5,I have a friend who is from India and her mother flew to the U.S.  I had the honor of trying 10 of her homemade dishes and each was better than the last.  I thought going to an Indian restaurant would be a bad experience after tasting authentic homemade Indian food.  And then I found Punjabi.  WOW!  The texture and flavors of my dinner was over the top exquisite and the service was top notch.  I live in South Florida and don't have many options but I may just have to fly to London to Punjab to eat.  Florida restaurants need a lesson in service as well as cooking.  The waiters and staff made me feel like I was a VIP from the moment I walked in.  If you want the real deal....go to this place.  5 amazing stars!!,1
5,"Fantastic.  Best Indian food I've ever had, actually... not that that's a ton, but still.  Plus, they have the London pub-fave Chicken Tikka Masala, which is not truly Indian but it's something that tourists love to have, so kudos to them for choosing to cater to that instead of being snooty over the fact that it's not an authentic Indian dish. 
The mango lassi that my mother in-law got, made with buttermilk rather than yogurt (which is common in the US), was very tasty.  Naan = perfection (we tried plain, garlic and cheese).  I don't remember what all we had because the names are always so foreign to me, but it was all completely delicious.  Punjab was the dining highlight of our London visit!",1
5,Best meal during our week in london. Right around corner from apartment we stayed at. Just order. Everything was excellent and reasonably priced. Bill was half what we paid at another indian place just two days earlier and food was on same level. Cant wait to return.,1
4,"Been twice this week!  Food is great, service wonderful, and the price is so reasonable for central London.  Tried the house red from Spain and was pleasantly surprised with the quality.  NO reservation but they seated us quickly.",1
4,"My friend and I stumbled upon this place purely by coincidence, and we're glad we did!  
I'm no Indian food connoisseur (and therefore some of your opinions may be very different than mine), but I'm still very willing to assert that the food here was pretty darn good!  Every bite was savory; the restaurant did well with combining an interesting mix of flavors.  The naan was delicious, the butter chicken was succulent,  and the chicken madras was my favorite (although it wasn't as spicy as I had expected).
We loved Punjab and will return in the future if the opportunity presents itself!",1
4,We had a group of 24 high school students and this was the final meal of our trip. The service and food were both very good and they were very accommodating and helpful. Would definitely recommend for future visits.,1
5,"Excellent food at decent price (for London).  We had the Acharri Murgha (chicken), Methi Gosht (lamb in Fenugreek), mushroom masala, and Kadu Sabji (pumpkin curry).  My girlfriend and I generally don't eat lamb, but we ordered the methi gosht based on the waiter's recommendation. It was excellent, and my favorite dish, with the pumpkin curry a close second.  My girlfriends liked the chicken best. The mushroom masala was good, but not fabulous like the other dishes.
This was my second visit to Punjab and I'm looking forward to going back on my next visit to London.",1
5,"We were visiting London from out of town and were looking for a low cost meal. we found Punjab on yelp and gave it a try. the food was so good the first time, we went back twice! the second time was even better than the first! fantastic chicken tikka masala, raita, vegetables khorma, and their specialty Punjabi dishes from the grandfathers recipes. the palak paneer was good- but the rest was memorable. Go HERE and be happy you did",1
5,"I am so glad there was a 2hs wait at Dishoom, enticing us to do the three minute walk over to Punjab, where the staff was welcoming and the food delicious. I'm admittedly not a connoisseur of Indian cuisine, or much of an adventurer in regards to food, but I did enjoy my classic chicken tikka masala and mango lassi. My BFF was equally satisfied by the food and ambiance. A bit of a splurge, in comparison to other places about London, but it /is/ near Covent Garden, and you do get value for your money. We went on a weeknight and didn't need reservations, but I'd suggest getting them if on the weekend. I don't doubt this place fills up.",1
5,"We came here for our first dinner during a work trip to London.  The food was absolutely delicious and just what I was looking for in great tasting Indian food.  The kadu puri (pumpkin in a crispy puff) was a great starter along with cheese naan.  We then ordered chicken tikka masala and vegetable curry.  Both were perfect!  
Wait staff were all very nice!",1
5,The staff was very accommodating especially with our large group and lack of reservation. The dishes were tasty. I highly recommend.,1
4,"All parts of the meal went super well here: the poppadoms were crispy and fresh, the naan perfectly cooked and the chicken tikka masala was creamy and flavorful. I can't tell you how disappointed I've been with other places' chicken tikka masala. Either it is too sweet or a bizarre neon reddish color that puts me off.
The service was amazing. They re-filled our water cups multiple times during the visit and asked us how our meal was. That in itself gives them a big 'ole star from me. 
Pleasant atmosphere, delicious food and fabulous service.",1
4,"best Punjabi food I've had in a long time, the chicken tikka, ghobi alu, and lamb madras were all delicious. Sure the ambiance was mediocre and the place had a weird chemical smell... who cares.. the food was amazing, stop being stuffy.",1
5,"I love Indian food! We eat it at home (CA, USA) but our my trip to London we wanted to see what the UK had! We loved this restaurant so much that we ate there twice on our short trip. We went way out of our way to try many well reviewed restaurants, but back we were. We couldn't resist it. Don't miss it! One of my best memories from this trip.",1
5,This place is amazing!!! I am visiting from Los Angeles and I have had my share of Indian food and this place was extremely delicious. It is a MUST!,1
4,"There are few restaurants that I will wait outside of until they open.
There are even fewer restaurants that will be completely full within minutes of opening.
And there are yet fewer restaurants that will completely justify both the wait and proceeding hype.
Punjab is one of these restaurants. 
Situated smack in central Covent Garden, I can only assume this restaurant gets a lot of love from visiting tourists, and perhaps the only reason I can think to avoid it.  (All yelpers have something against going to a place listed in every guide book as ""the"" place to go.)
... Unless it's this good. In which case: roll up your sleeves, perfect your perfect American accent, throw 'dem bows (if necessary, of course) and wait in line. 
It's worth it!",1
3,"Not that I'm an Indian food know-it-all, let me start off by saying that eating here was like eating at any Indian restaurant worth its curry in Jersey City, Iselin or Edison, NJ - those in the know will know what I mean, but at least there you get more food for your money - I'm not looking for an all-you-can-eat buffet, far from it, but the butter chicken had two pieces of chicken in it - c'mon! The sauce was delicious, though. 
Don't get me wrong, the food here is good - Punjab is touted as the oldest Indian restaurant in London in continuance operation, and for good reason. 
The pumpkin curry was probably the best thing on the menu - spectacular.  All the food was fresh and tasty.  We ordered a variety of dishes, rice dishes, nan, chicken tikka masala, etc.  The wait staff was very attentive and there when you needed them.  The Sikh patrolling the rooms, making sure everything was done just right, transported you back to the time of the British Raj - the good times, not the bad.
Anyway, that said, food was good, prices a bit high, and typical of London you gotta eat ethnic foods or die trying.",-1
2,"Had samosas to start and the butter chicken with naan and raita for dinner.  We were excited after the samosas,  they were delicious.  But the chicken on the bone (it was actually the tandoori chicken) difficult to eat with the sauce. Oh, and the sauce, so greasy,  oil was floating on top. Our poor naan was overcooked.  Service was fine.",-1
5,"We were looking for an authentic Indian meal in London, a city known for its large Indian population. We found Punjab on the edge of the Bloomsbury neighborhood. Everything from the pakora appetizers to the tandoori chicken and lamb biryani was delicious.",1
4,"I'm not super fussy (or an expert) when it comes to my Indian food, but I really like this place. Super friendly staff, good food, nice area of London. It's not a really fancy place but they still do a great job with white linen tablecloths and candles etc. I really enjoy coming here and will come back again.",1
5,"Great experience from beginning to end....welcomed at the door by several staff members, sat quickly, served immediately, and the food was incredible!  Highly recommend this authentic Indian experience to everyone!",1
5,"Best freaking Indian food I've ever had in my life. I can't say i didn't like anything (maybe not the cool cucumber yogurt because i don't like cucumbers)
But it was all delicious. I can't stress how much i liked it.
Mango Lassi (so good and fresh, share if you can't handle too much sweetness)
Pumpkin Curry
Chicken Tikka Masala (delicious)
Lamb Korma Curry (so bombdiggity good i just want to fly back to London to eat it again. seriously)
CHEESE AND BUTTER NAAN dipped in curry= heaven
If you want to see a video of the restaurant, its on my food blog here:

1,"We had dinner on 10/22, meal was fine.  We paid our bill with our credit card, no problem.  Several weeks later we got out credit card bill and we had 2 charges for our dinner, one without the tip ($37), the second with the tip ($40.81).   
We've enjoyed dinner here in the past and haven't had any other problems.",-1
5,"We came for the first time and we'll  definitely come back! The food was amazing and they adjusted the dishes as we like (not spicy, dairy free, etc) and the service was incredible - the restaurant was full and we felt like we're the only table. We loved it!",1
5,"Stopped in for lunch after a few less than satisfying meals during a quick stop in London. The food matched the reviews that I had read. I especially recommend the pumpkin curry- excellent. Also, the breads were very good.
The place was quiet and the service attentive without being intrusive.",1
2,"I  am so disappointed!! 
I love Indian food, and after reading all those good reviews, I decided to give it a go. I went once, I won't go twice. 
Me and my boyfriend decided to go for lunch, the restaurant was empty, which was good after hearing stories of queues in front of the restaurant. 
I ordered Chicken Tikka Massala with plain rice. What a shame. The chicken was well cooked, but my tikka massala sauce was just disgusting. It was way too salty and just not good. Didn't taste of tomato at all. I have made tikka massala myself and I know what goes in there. No idea what they put but it was not good. 
My boyfriend ordered Lamb Korma. We had tasted better. 
In all, Marks and Spencer is better quality and it actually tastes better... If you feel like Indian good, honestly, don't waste your money, or else, go somewhere else.",-1
4,"I really enjoyed Punjab.  The servers were humorous, attentive, and offered up their suggestions.  We pretty much went with the dishes that were marked as specialties on the menu.  
Starting with my favorite, we had:
KARAHI GOSHT: lamb curry with tomato and green pepper sauce
KADU SABJI: a pumpkin curry
ACHARRI MURGHA: a chicken curry and punjabi specialty that the menu cited as a must try at least once in a life time
Everything was really tasty and flavorful.  The lamb was very tender, the pumpkin had great flavor and the sauce for the chicken was interesting (in a good way).
I would definitely return if I were in the mood for Indian food!",1
5,"Most delicious Indian food experience EVER!  We stumbled upon this place while strolling Covent Garden. Arrived around 8 pm and were seated immediately in the back of the restaurant - very cozy.  
Service was quick, kind and efficient.  The server had family in the SF bay area too!  Small world. 
We ordered the butter chicken and chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and roti as well has basmati rice.  Both chicken dishes were AMAZING.  the spice level was perfect and the chicken was cooked to perfection.  
I was so excited after the meal and told my husband that I could eat this food daily if it tasted THIS good.  
Looking for a good place in California to try.  Too bad we haven't found one yet.  I guess it's true that London has the best indian food.  We will definitely be back.",1
5,"My second visit to this gem of a restaurant did not disappoint. We made reservations and we were seated promptly. We started with the garlic naan and it was great! Then the chicken tikka, lamb korma curry and gobi aloo. Every dish was perfectly spiced and cooked to perfection. We once again had a fantastic meal to remember at this restaurant. Very highly recommended!",1
4,"Good indian food.  Spent the day shopping in convent garden and stopped here for lunch.  Had the chicken tikka masala which was creamy and just the way I like it.  Also had the saag aloo which was also solid.  Level of spice was perfect (I typically like things medium, so if you like your dishes hot or mild you may have to ask for it).
Enjoyed the decor and had a window seat so also enjoyed the people watching.",1
5,"We are in London visiting and it was my dad's birthday. All he wanted was some good tikki masala so I went on the search and found pun jab. I wanted something that was classic and not to stuck up or fancy and just simply good. Punjab delivered. I had the lamb korma with plain rice and naan- the flavors blended together perfectly and were not overpowering. I tried some of the tikki masala as well and it was excellent! The place is small but comfortable and we were comfortably set with a party of 5.  I loved the windows in the front of the restaurant and if I came back I would ask to sit near the front simply to people watch. I've considered moving from Houston, Texas to London simply so I could eat here at least twice a week. It seems rash but I'm still thinking about it. Overall best Indian food EVER!",1
2,"Extremely mediocre food, poor ambiance, weird and powerful soap smell, and high prices. £27 for two with two dishes, a paratha, rice, and raita. Maybe for really good Indian food, or a nice restaurant, but this was not that. Felt like a tourist trap, worth avoiding.
Note that they have canned mango as a desert option for over £3. Hilarious.",-1
4,"We went here for dinner on our last night in London.  Since part of our group are vegetarians we figured that Indian food was a good bet to please all people involved.  We ordered a plethora of dishes ranging in Chicken Tikka Masala to their famous Pumpkin Curry.  Throw in a few more curries, rice, and naan and we were filled to the brim. 
My personal favorite was the Pumpkin curry...it wasn't spicy...more of a sweet yet savory dish that left me licking my plate.  The Chicken was good too but didn't taste that different from others I have tried at other Indian restaurants.  
Next time I am in London I am definitely coming back.",1
5,"best indian food in a long time. chicken tikka masala and butter chicken.
The only Indian food I've eaten has been from Southern California. I wasn't sure how the food in London would be, but I was happily surprised by Punjab. We were jet lagged so we ate at some random time as they were just preparing for the dinner rush, but they were very quick to seat us. 
We had the chicken tikka masala and the butter chicken. Both were excellent and had just the right amount of flavor without being too overpowering. I would definitely eat here again if I were to come back - plus it's in a pretty convenient location, within walking distance to a lot of shops.",1
5,"A queue at 6pm on a Tuesday evening....it pretty much should say it all...I LOVE the food there - wide selection of high-quality Indian food. It comes extremely close to the Delhi street food, which tastes like heaven anyway. It is also a gem for vegetarians - large variety of non-meat dishes, I'd easily turn vegetarian if I could've eaten there everyday!
I love the atmosphere - very homely, cozy, amazing service - everytime it's like you're meeting old friends! Though in a prime location and respectable-looking customers this place is not pretentious, it makes you want to come back there again.
When we went to celebrate India winning the cricket World cup we got free sweets at the end of the dinner!
Tip - book a table, rather than stumbling outside you'll get your table relatively fast (there is a lot, a LOT of demand...)",1
3,"Service was spotty and staff. A bit rude. The 3 stars are for the fantastic garlic chicken and naan. The chicken tiki masala was ok, nothing exceptional.",-1
1,"I had a very very poor and disappointing experience at Punjab restaurant.
I ordered mix grill, yellow lentil and mix vegetable curry.  The lamb in the mix grill was completely dark black and I wish I have taken a picture to prove it. The other meat on the grill I couldn't even Identify what that was cos it was so black and tasteless. The yellow lentil and veg curry was  like a dish from the buffet because of complete lack of excitement and freshness.  The only that's fresh was the nan bread.  This place is a tourist trap, we are all fooled by ""the oldest northern Indian food in London"" slogan! There are plenty of other good authentic Indian restaurants in London. Please don't waste your money in here. DISAPPOINTED.",-1
1,Terrible experience. Seekh kebab overcooked and dry. Malai tikka had little flavor. As did the Kali Daal. Nothing even close to authentic punjab food. Stay away.,-1
5,"I wrote a note when I last checked in, booked marked the place and didn't review it at the time. My note was ""best Indian food I've had"". I'd like to say I've had better from a restaurant but I haven't. Even living in Seattle we have amazing Indian and this one took the cake. I was fortunate enough to try many dishes as we were with a group of 15-20 ppl and probably ordered over half of the menu. This place will NOT disappoint you. Authentic and I hope it stays that way.",1
1,"I had my doubts about the place from the moment we stepped in and saw the drab, dingy, stained, and discolored carpets, matched by carpet-upholstered chairs.  As we were ushered to the back room we were hit with the stench of industrial cleaner that permeates the restaurant.  What odor(s) are they trying to hide?  The stench was ever-present, and we didn't get used to it as the dinner progressed.
They tried to seat us in the back room in between two busy, loud tables even though every single other table in that room was open.  We asked to be reseated to a table in a different row, and after they checked with the host at the front, they obliged our request, but appeared to be unnerved that we had disrupted their normal seating pattern.
The food?  In a word, subpar.  I started with a mango lassi, which normally should be cool, thick, and creamy.  Punjab's mango lassi was tepid, watery, and bland.  I strongly believe that it was pre-mixed or came straight from a carton before being watered down substantially to cut on costs.  I didn't finish it.  We ordered a few of the dishes that had received rave reviews on yelp -- the chicken tikka masala, grandpa's daal, a saag dish, and garlic naan.  I wanted to like these dishes -- even just one -- but all were unflavorful and disappointing.
If this restaurant were located outside the touristy Covent Garden area, I highly doubt it would survive or would earn the same *shockingly* high yelp ratings.  I would rate Punjab among the bottom tier of Indian restaurants I've eaten at in my life.
Don't go.",-1
5,"Some of the best Indian food I've ever had - granted London has no shortage of Indian restaurants - but Punjab goes above and beyond in the service category, making this a must-stop if you are in Covent Garden. 
My friend and I had the Cheese Naan, Chicken Karahi and Acharri Murgha. The chicken was succulent and the sauces/spices flavorful without being heavy. Good selection of wine+beers and prices quite fair for London. 
Where Punjab truly separates itself is in its service - Amrit and his staff go to extraordinary lengths to take care of their customers. My friend lost a family heirloom in the restaurant and Amrit and a few of his staff personally helped us search for an hour-plus after close to find the ring, and sure enough it turned up! I recommend Punjab to anyone valuing fantastic food+service in Covent Garden.",1
4,"Delicious!!!! Service was not great which is why I'm giving it 4 stars, but everything I ate was super tasty!",1
5,"The Butter Chicken was absolutely delicious. Many places make it too sweet; instead, it had a complex flavor combined with a sublime buttery texture. I asked to have it spicy, and I was not disappointed! Next time I'm London, I'll be coming here again.",1
4,"Solid 4 to 5 star food, I definitely liked this place and it may have been the best Indian food I had in London. A bit touristy due to its location, but this is a great place to eat.",1
5,"baigan ka bharta + gobi aloo !!! ttasty
yums",1
4,"Fun and friendly staff, bustling spot, yummy flavorful dishes, reasonable prices, fast service (generally), and happy customers!  The naan with a little flatter than we were used to but still fresh and tasty - especially the garlic naan.  
FYI: Had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table for two at 8p on a Thursday.",1
5,"London is full of Indian food, this one is ahead of the pack!",1
5,This place serves authentic food. Had the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Madras curries and both were amazing. Cheese Naan very tasty and service pretty decent. Worth a visit.,1
2,"I had heard that London had some of THE best Indian food outside of India.  Living near Little India in Artesia, California there's a lot of good ass Indian food, so I had to compare the Indian food in London.  
Punjab seemed like a good candidate.  After getting lost a few times with the damn directions on the Yelp iPhone app, we finally found it.  It's near Covent Garden and Picadilly Circus, but we kept getting turned around.  
Punjab is a very nice, classy restaurant. The wait staff were friendly and quick.  There were a lot of people eating there too.  Good mixed crowd and even some customers of Indian decent were eating there, so it looked promising.  Nothing on the menu really jumped out at us, so we ordered spinach paneer, rice, and garlic naan.  The food was not bad, but nothing to knock my socks off.  It was pricey too.  Sorry, but I've had better Indian food in Artesia and at more affordable prices.  Maybe next time I have to try an Indian restaurant in London that is a off the beaten path and not near the touristy part of town.  I would've thought they had a Little India section in London too, but either it doesn't exist or I couldn't find it.",-1
4,"Punjab is one of my favourites in London. The place can accommodate larger parties and is nice enough for me to take business acquaintances to. Service is exceptional. 
The average curry dish is about 8-9 quids, which is a fine range for restaurants in the Covent Garden area and reasonable for the quality of the food. 
The curries are flavorful, though it is not the very saucy kind, in case you are someone who enjoys the curry sauce more than the meats in the curry. 
The tandoori dishes are fantastic; very juicy. Generally, Punjab does exceptional meats, whether grilled or in curry--very tender and juicy. Try the mixed grill for sure! 
For folks who want cheaper curry and the super saucy kind in a smaller place, you might consider Tiger Spice.",1
2,"I am doubting my fellow Yelpers after seeing this has a 4-star average rating.  
Landed in London today, am put up in a nearby hotel for work and was craving some chicken tikka masala.
The naan was inedible, the chicken was dry, and the tikka masala lacked spice/flavor.  Rarely do I leave food on my plate (I have a problem of eating everything in sight!), but I didn't finish anything I ordered.  
Will continue my quest to get good Indian in London elsewhere...if you're on the fence about coming here, I'd pass.",-1
3,"Ordered:
Chicken Tikka Masala - 
Unfortunately have had better Chicken Tikka Masala in San Francisco, Malaysia AND Sweden which is a sad statement since Chicken Tikka Masala originated from the UK...and most food in Sweden is lacklustre.
The chicken was VERY TENDER, which I did think saved the dish from the lack of seasoning and spice.
Rice - The plain basmati rice was perfectly cooked, but was missing some basic spices that are normally added to even plain basmati rice.
Had to pay for rice which I thought was odd, but I guess that is the norm in the UK.
Butter Naan - Was very small in size and was VERY thin so it was completely crispy like a cracker which was a shame.  It was almost impossible to use the naan for dipping in sauce or using to eat the food on my plate.
I don't know if I will go back or recommend to others for the price.
16+ GBP for the above items.  I ate all the food but didn't get full, so beware if you have a big appetite you may need to order a 2nd dish or several naan.
The staff however was very nice, helpful and attentive.  One waiter saw that I was about finished with my rice and naan and politely asked me if I would like more.  But at 3.50p an order I declined.",-1
2,"I was pretty disappointed with this place. I rarely get back to the UK these days having moved overseas and one of the things I really miss is good Indian food. Everytime I come back I look forward to having a good tikka masala, but I was sorely let down by Punjab. It looked the real deal, cramped tables, classic menu, everything seemed ok on the surface. The food though was meh. The naan was overcooked and crispy, the chicken was likewise overdone and dry, even the masala sauce was lacking in tomatoes or spice. There is far better to be had in London.",-1
5,"Five of us ate here--luckily we got a table without reservations on a Friday evening.  The staff was friendly and helped us order.  I had Chicken Tikka Masala since I don't like real spicy and it was wonderful.  My son ordered Chicken Madras and wait staff asked twice if he was sure, since it is very hot.  He liked it.  Others also enjoyed their food.  Plain Naan and Garlic Naan also very good.  Not cheap but no where in London is.  Staff was very attentive.   We will go back if we are lucky enough to return to London.",1
5,"My fella and I are regulars here and always get a huge welcome when we turn up :) this place is run by an extremely friendly bunch of guys who've been with the business for donkey's years. They have a near magical knack of seating groups of people even when the restaurant looks entirely full, and make really great Indian food.
 As a veggie, my favourite dishes here are the 'pumpkinettes' (on the menu it assures diners that 'Punjabis go crazy for these miniatures pumpkins'), the special kali daal and the aubergine dishes. The bread is also superb - much lighter and crispier than naan at your average curry house.
 A great place where I'm sure I'll be coming back for many years!",1
4,"Great Find!
We were in London and wanted Indian for dinner since many people have told me that Indian food in London was very good..I asked the desk clerk at our hotel if he could recommend a good Indian restaurant in the area..It probably helped that he was Indian, and he enthusiatically suggested to go to Punjab. It was about a 5 minute walk and we were immediately welcomed by a friendly staff and warm atmosphere. 
Food was delicious..Got samosoas for appetizer and the lamb madras with rice and nan on side. I like spicy and the when I ordered the entree the waiter made sure to check if I like spicy food..The lamb was very spicy and very good!
We def will go back next time in London...",1
3,"Wow, I can't believe that I find myself so at odds with other Yelp!ers who have raved about the food at Punjab. I thought it was just OK, nothing special. The restaurant itself is a delight, comfortable and welcoming with loads of character and the service was impeccable. However the food, which was the main reason I was there, was good, but not great.
Best of the dishes was the Pudina Gossht, Lamb marinated in fresh mint cooked with herbs and spices and green peppers. The lamb was succulent and the spicing delicate it was good but not historic. However, the Methi Murgha, chicken with cooked fresh fenugreek, was bland, the pillau had a dirty flavor to it that matched its grayish colour and the bhindi masala was unremarkable.
Great atmosphere, whether you're dating or doing business, but there is much better Punjabi food to be had. Maybe dinner is better than lunch for some reason but I won't be going back to find out.",-1
4,"The Punjab is a busy North Indian restaurant near Covent Garden. I called for lunch with a colleague. Despite being fairly quiet the initial service was a bit slow, but the staff seemed friendly and helpful.
 I went with one of their speciality dishes: Acharri Gosht a pickle-styled lamb curry, tangy & irresistible medium spiced dish served with Naan bread which was very flavoursome and at £9.80 for the curry and £2.35 for the naan reasonable pricing for central London.
 I'll be back! Recommended.",1
5,"The best Indian in Covent Garden, serving everything you expect from an Indian. Could be the best Indian in London, but I haven't been to them all. (Yet). The restaurant always has a queue outside it, so either book or be prepared to wait for yummy Indian food.",1
5,"I keep dreaming of going back here, but sadly have to go home to California. Try the carrot dessert. It sounds so unappetizing, but is one of the best desserts I've ever had. I even found a recipe online and was able to make it at home with little difficulty! The food here is perfect, and the servers are always so polite and full of the best stories if you ask. The atmosphere is surprisingly quiet and intimate for Seven Dials. It's a little on the high side for Indian food in American dollars, but you will never regret eating here!",1
2,"The most agitated I've ever been while eating a meal. From the minute we walked in, they were hesitant to give us a table (even though we were surrounded by empty tables) and told is we'd have to be out in an hour if they did. When ordering, they kept questioning our order as if they were judging us for ordering so little and the waiter snapped at us for ordering out of order (kept saying to order appetizers first). The entire meal they hovered around- not allowing us to enjoy our food or have peaceful conversation and after giving us our bill, they asked if we were done paying three times within two or three minutes of dropping it off. Two servers stood and watched us count our cash which was uncomfortable. The food was fine but the entire experience made me want to leave asap.",-1
4,"Good food. Achari gosht was tangy and tasty. Good portions and value for money, especially considering the location. Will definitely go back.",1
4,"Second visit here. This time it was early and the place was empty. The food was not nearly as good as the first time, when it was extremely busy. I ordered WAY TOO MUCH food because I wanted to try a few things. I love the masala pappadum and butter naan, of course. I also ordered the pumpkin curry, the okra and the yogurt with cucumbers. Sorry I cannot recall the proper names but I think they should be easy to identify on the menu. Everything was good, just not the ""to die for"" tastes of my first visit. I'll still visit this place on every trip to London but I think I will go when it is very crowded next time!",1
4,"The best North Indian cuisine in London. A lovely Indian restaurant in Covent Garden. The peshwari naan has been a favourite of mine. The portion sizes are good too. Ideally book a table, as you often have to wait long if you haven't booked one.",1
4,"Great Indian food in Covent Garden.  I stopped in for lunch on a Monday and order the Pumpkin Curry (ask for spicy) and a order of Butter Naan.  A great meal for 8 sterling.  
The curry was had great flavor and texture.  I had never had pumpkin curry before and I was impressed.  What is nice about Punjab is that they have a great selection of meat and veggie dishes.  
Can't wait for my next visit for dinner with a larger group to order multiple dishes.",1
4,"Like most reviewers, out of towner in London who had to try Indian food. I'm glad Punjab was my first stop.
I live in the Bay Area, CA. I use to live near Little Kabul in Fremont. I've had most places down there and seeing the indian population have had my fare share of Indian food.
Punjab was great. The samosa was very good but not the best I've had (India Kitchen on Geary St. in SF has the best Samosa's in the world BTW), the pilau of rice was decent but the Lamb Seekh kebab and Saag Chicken were some of the best I have ever had. The Saag was perfectly creamy, clean tasting and delicious. The kebab was moist, cooked and spiced perfectly.",1
3,"While this seems to be the ""happening"" spot on a busy weekend night, I've definitely had better Punjabi food. The waiters and manager were all very nice, but took a long time coming around. I did like the old photographs from Punjab on the walls, and it was nice to hear a familiar tongue in the middle of London.
Be careful if you're planning on going with a big party on a weekend night - this place is very busy and they may very likely not have enough space for you if they don't take reservations.",-1
1,"DON'T GO!!!  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! Awful food and the most Awful Service! Very very poor quality meat,  the lamb was tough and inedible and the chicken rubbery. There were 4 of us and we left the vast majority of our food and we were 4 hungry people!!!  There was a 40 minute wait in between the starters and the main, without explanation. The starters tasted as if they were pre-cooked and frozen and the mains had virtually no spice at all.  We weren't asked if everything was ok with our food but we're served the bill without asking and then questioned as to the fact that we opted not to pay the service charge when we paid, which in a our years combined and in all the countries we've visited we have never experienced that before. THE SERVICE CHARGE IS OPTIONAL FOR A REASON AND BY LAW IN THE UK!!! Good service may have asked what we were not happy with! This was NOT GOOD SERVICE!!! One of our group is a chef at the Hylton and was appalled by what he tasted and saw. 
***AVOID AT ALL COSTS ***
***TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE ***",-1
2,"Riiight, I'm not sure where all these four and five star reviews are coming from. I'm a huge fan of good Indian food but this was only alright, average really. 
Maybe I was a little annoyed because we all ordered nan but only half of us actually got any. But there was an over-abundance of rice. I got a half a piece of plain nan and believe me, that is not enough. My veggie korma was only really korma inspired and lacked a depth of flavour. 
The service was far from spectacular  especially since our bill came to over £20 more than it should have been and we all paid a good bit extra to make up for it. Sorry Punjab, this was a fail for me.",-1
4,"The best Butter Chicken in London! I always order this dish when I go there - perfectly spiced and the chicken is roasted, just the way it should be. It must be eaten with butter naan. Tried a Methi Gosht, but it wasn't that good. 4-stars just for the Butter Chicken.
Atmosphere could be much better - they've crammed too many tables into the place, but they do make up for it by seating 2 people at a table for 4. 
Price - 20 Pounds/person.",1
5,"There is nothing I like better than stuffing my face with curry, well actually there is...stuffing my face with damn good curry. This has to be one of the most supurb places to eat in the area, and that's saying something...
There was a queue actually outside the door from 5.30pm waiting for them to open and I can see why. The selection of dishes is what you'd expect with a few house specials thrown in the mix. A a new meat eater I tried a bit of everything and it was yummy, I actually had to move my plate away from me to stop myself from eating until I was sick - yup I'm a glutton! Deal with it!",1
5,"Yep, going 5 stars.  When the food is absolutely tasty, the atmosphere is nice and I get excellent service, I am sold.  
The place is very large so they seem to always have a table.  What I loved about this place was that it had some really innovative dishes that I don't always see on menus.  For instance, we had an insanely delicious pumpkin appetizer which I highly recommend.  We also had a lovely stuffed aubergine which I had never seen offered elsewhere.  I also appreciated that the food wasn't overly greasy (my proof is always when I bring home the leftovers and take them out of the fridge the next day and you can see the fat congeal).  The food to fat ratio here was good.",1
3,"Mmm...  pretty yum.  There were lots of us at the restaurant and I felt like they were quite accommodating and patient with our table.
On Lizzie's recommendation I went for the fall off the bone butter chicken which was yummy- tangy and spicy and extremely dippable- in fact we ended up using uneaten bits of naan off other people's plate to mop our sauce.  The perswari naan was sweet but not too sweet, though I like mine with fruit in it, so slightly disappointed it was only sweeterned nuts.
The only thing is they gave us bottled water instead of tap (as we requested) and that the poor server's arm was too short to reach over the other side of the table.  
I think Tayyabs is still much better, despite the lack of service and infinitely cheaper too.  So there you go.  Punjab, I will probably be back if looking for curry in town, but I'd rather make the trip and go east.",-1
5,"The best Indian food in London, if you ever visit please visit this restaurant. Great choices!! Excellent food and great people...",1
5,"Oh my god, this was the best Chicken Tikka Masala ever. I eat at a bunch of different Indian places near my home base of San Francisco, and while several of them are quite excellent, what made this stand out was the texture of the chicken and the combination of a tomato-ey savory element that was, just yum. I will be back next time, and every time, that I am in London.",1
3,"Dinner for one. Service was quick and efficient (rather than warm and welcoming) but got a table straight away. Starter of Pumpkin Curry Puri was fine without being worth a special mention, Main course of 'Grandad's black lentil dhal' was OK, but (for my taste) a bit runny as a main; I'd have it again as a side. Rice, chapatti and a pint of Cobra gave a bill just over £20. This included a 10% service charge of £1.87. If they'd left it off, I'd have left a bigger tip.
Turnover was fast: business is obviously good. Overall OK, but a bit wham-bam-thank you ma'am.
Go for a quick bite to eat rather than a night out or you'll be in bed for 10.",-1
3,"I suppose I should start this by saying that I'm not a fan of curry or indian food.
.............................
With that, I hear immigration calling...they want their visa back.
But seriously, I went with a group of friends hoping that the light would shine down and I would fall magically in love with all things Indian, and live a happy life satisfying late night cravings with poppadoms and tikka masala to my heart's content.
Well, that didn't happen. Punjab put up a good try though. There was nothing to complain about, the service was excellent, the food was good. i had chicken korma and the portion was large for the price, and tasted good. My friends all enjoyed their courses and alcohol was reasonable for being in downtown London.
The inside had some interesting colour schemes going on, and really wasn't a fan of the mustard yellow. I'd say give it a try, but don't expect his holiness, the Lord of Naan to shine down on you after your done.",-1
1,"I ate at this restaurant and it was not good, the butter chicken was not creamy. I have eaten at many different Indian restaurants and trust me this one is not good",-1
3,"We had high expectations of this restaurant but it ended up being just ok. We had the pumpkin appetizer which was served very hot and was good. We also had saag paneer (very average). The paneer cheese in the dish was chewy and didn't have much flavor. We also ordered Chicken Tikka Masala which was tangy and decent tasting but didn't best some of the ones I've had before. The naan was good. Rice was decent but not great. We also had two types of pappadum and we prefer the masala pappadum to the plain. The chutneys and spices were not very flavorful. Nothing was really spicy. I ordered Rasmalai for dessert. It was good, milky and rich.",-1
4,"When I lived in London about 5 years ago, Punjab was a regular stop on the way home from work.  The staff is so friendly (especially when you're a regular), the food is delicious, the prices are fair, and everyone I brought here fell in love with this place.  ""Punjaaaaab!!!"" became a regular chant when someone asked the question, ""Where should we go for dinner tonight?""
Hope it's still as good as it was!  Definitely going to pay a visit when I revisit London next...",1
4,"Not quite five stars from me, but still very, very good.
It's easy to see why you need to book or else expect to wait in a long queue, as the atmosphere is great and the food superb, giving you a great dining experience.
The menu is an interesting read.. I won't spoil it but if you read the descriptions you'll find it hard not to crack a smile or five.
And the food, what most restaurants are famous for... I had the kadu-puri for starters (after the obligatory poppadoms of course!) and it was soooooo good. A light and slightly crispy pastry/batter filled with curried pumpkin yumminess.
After that I had a try of three vegetable curries which were all cooked very well and had an abundance of flavour without being so hot that I couldn't enjoy them.
The one thing that stood out as a negative, however, was that as a vegetarian, whilst there were a lot of options, I felt that a lot of them are what in a lot of other places you'd find as side dishes. I kind of felt like something was missing, like I'd missed the main course and gone straight for the extras. That's not to say it didn't taste great or that I left still feeling hungry, but when I go back I'll see if there's not something I can order with a bit more substance.
Prices? We all had poppadoms, mains, rice, naan and alcohol and paid a little over £20 per head. In other words, not cheap, but not bad, and certainly worth it.",1
5,"Best Indian food ever! Try the Pumpkin curry, I want to go back to London just to eat that again it was to die for. Do make advanced reservations or you'll never get in.",1
4,"Is Punjab fancy and exotic?
No.
Is Punjab completely delicious and a pretty good deal for the West End?
Ohyesohyesohyes.
Punjab is a pretty special slice of curry heaven, right in the middle of tourist-central Covent Garden (don't judge).  Tasty, non-greasy, fresh Indian food (including ""Granddad's Dall""), at prices that make you think you could come here pretty regularly.  Worth every moment on the tube, surrounded by smelly, dirty people.
But book in advance. It was absolutely heaving on a Friday night, and we had to fight off the folks waiting at the front who hadn't made reservations, because they seriously were clawing at us for our table.",1
3,"The service was good, the restaurant upstairs is over lit and soul less. One does get the impression they want you in and out as fast as possible. The food seemed very ordinary, pre cooked and waiting under lights, nothing special. I always  seem compare other indian restaurants in london to Rickshaw in Battersea square which is amazing. So I was disappointed,",-1
5,"I live in a town with numerous Indian restaurants, so while I'm not a connoisseur I certainly have had experience with the cuisine. Everything we had here was excellent, from the naan to a vegetarian daal and flaming chicken tikka. Service was professional and efficient (not sure what the complaints are about here). My lone complaint is that they pushed our table in a bit cramped in order to keep a main aisle open, but really that's a trivial thing. People at the next table were Canadians who said they'd been here last year and made sure to come again in their visit to London this year, and I'd certainly be happy to go again. Recommend.",1
4,"Wow! This place is pretty special. The décor has that authentic lick of yellow paint with pictures of classically dressed Indians and well set tables to complete the scene. At 6 o'clock there were people waiting outside for the doors to open. At 6:15pm the restaurant was almost full. Patrons of Punjab clearly need their tandoori fix.
The service is professional with many servers waiting to take your order, meaning you are never left waiting for something. As for the food, I am going to keep it simple. EXCELLENT! Whether you are here for a quick eat with friends or as a romantic couple, this Indian eatery has a touch of class you will surely enjoy.",1
5,"They say the Indian food is good in London.  This is where to get it.  It is so delicious that a couple days ago, I came here, completely stuffed my face, eating well being what a healthy portion should be, got appendicitis within 36 hours, and now I've just left the hospital to share with you this culinary war story.  Might have been worth it.  
Don't over eat.",1
5,"Punjab serves the best Indian food from all the places I have tried in London, Holland and the US.  When I'm there, I'm family! ;o)  There are days that I've been for both lunch and dinner!
I'm a vegetarian and usually order 1 or 2 vegetable dishes which is plenty.  My omnivorous friends are very content with Punjab as well as their chicken, lamb and fish dishes are very good, according to them.  I strongly recommend the Saag Panir, Chana Masala and Vegetable Kofte.  And the Gobi Aloo of course.
If you go on a Thursday - Sunday night, I recommend making a reservation as Punjab is very popular.  Also, if you're with a large party, making a reservation would be a good thing to do.  Enjoy!!",1
5,"When I was in London recently I ate here and I have to say, this food was amazing. The experience is such that when you walk in to restaurant you feel like you are in India. The wait staff was helpful and the portions were large. The food was fresh and hot and reasonably priced. Even given the fact that it was in a theatre district area in London! Covent Garden is a beautiful area and this place is worth making a special trip to- I ate a bit of Indian food while I was in England and this one was the best! Be sure to get their Nan and their chicken tikka masala. Amazing stuff!",1
3,"I agree with Danny K - 'service' is a misnomer. Waiters seem to begrudge our requests. We asked to sit by a window but we were told that that table was for 4 and we were 3 so we should sit at a table for 3. They did concede after the blast of air conditioning was raised as an issue - kind of spoiled the feeling of a treat out. Courteous interactions were sparse throughout the rest of the meal but I remember the food being good. The loos was unisex - good for some, but  in a relatively small space.",-1
3,"I'm surprised by all the great reviews. The food is decent, but just mediocre. The menu is quite boring as well.",-1
4,"This was one of the better Indian meals while we were in London although we wished one of our brown friends were with us to take us on a complete culinary tour.  When in London, stick with Indian.",1
4,"Got butter chicken here. Was delicious. But I was starving at the moment. But, I'm sure it would still be delicious were I not starving. They charge extra for the rice. Also, the selection of beer was pretty lousy (I guess you a can expect that from an Indian restaurant). And the Rasmalai for dessert was delicious. So, 4 stars for them.",1
4,"Thank you yelpers for the fantastic recommendation.  The pumpkin curry seemed like an oxymoron on the menu but thanks to the other reviews we read, we gave it a shot. It was fantastic! The cheesy naan was light and perfect, not a hot mess of grease.  I've passed on the name of this place to my sister and her friends as well.  The prices were extremely reasonable, it was warm and comfortable and the service and servings were plentiful.  I'd go back in a heartbeat!",1
5,So good!  I went to get lunch here with a group of friends and everything was delicious and they were very accomdating to a big group of us (8 people). Can't wait to go back.,1
5,"Top notch service and food - everything was excellent.  Went there for lunch and had dal, naan and mago lassi.  Wish they had one in the US! :)",1
5,"Delicious Indian food in Covent Garden. It was a few minutes wait on a Friday evening for three, but then seated and fed in great time. We family-styled peshwar naan (sweet, yum), saag paneer and another saag potato dish, chicken tikka masala, lamb korma, and surprisingly good red wine and of course big bottle of cobra (beer).",1
5,"This is a ""must visit"" restaurant whenever I am in London.  You just simply can't get Indian this good anywhere I have been in the states (although, you could say that about almost any!).
Typical for London, the dining spaces are tight...and there can be a wait if you don't have a reservation.  But don't let any of that deter you from trying this gem.",1
4,"I ate here on my recent trip to London and had an amazing dinner.  The papadums and accompanying chutneys were nice and light, perfect for a summer meal.  The entrees were fantastic as well; if you are a fan of lamb, try the Karahi Gosht, or if you prefer meatless dishes, try Granddad's Kali Daal.  Both are excellent.  My favorite part of the meal, however, was the mango lassi.  It's definitely the best I've had so far.",1
4,"Best Chicken Tikka Masala EVER! I swear every time I eat at a new Indian Restaurant in London it just gets better and better. The tikka masala sauce here has some spice to it and is very addicting. The naan bread however, was probably the worst I've had. It was too hard to tear and not soft at all. I'd probably go here again just for the chicken tikka masala
anitaeat.com",1
4,"The best recommendation is that my better half .. who hates Indian food .. enjoyed dinner at Punjab. 
Expert use of spices perfumed our lamb and chicken dishes. 
Friendly, expert confident table service.
Will definitely return on my next visit to London.",1
2,"I've only eaten here once - and I don't even remember the name of the dish I ordered.  It was one of the recommended ones, and it was good.
However nowhere near as good as how much it cost.  Maybe 3 quid is standard in London for a plate of plain white rice, but this meal was only marginally better than what I normally pay half as much for.",-1
3,"This place COULD actually be amazing. The flavors of their curries are very good and the naan is of excellent quality. However, I personally feel that they skimp on ingredient quality and charge prices that would indicate higher quality. I had a fish curry and a vegetable medley made mostly of canned or frozen peas, corn and carrots. Just not up to standard for the prices that they are charging and for the quality of food that they have the potential to produce.",-1
4,"Had great lunch here at Punjab...  The curries were thick and complex.  The many different filled naan was nice, my favorite being the coconut fruit filled.  It went very nicely with the curry surprisingly.  Desserts were excellent here... the milk soaked cake was my favorite as well as the icecreams.  Service was good and nice ambiance.  Overall, would recommend.",1
5,"The best ramen I've ever had!
The cleanest Ramen restaurant I've yet seen
The friendliest staff you can imagine
The (1 of) best finds we stumbled upon in Soho London
We both had the special tonkatzu broth with marinated ground pork. And the pork belly bun.. Both Soooo good!!
Highly recommend this place from this girl that's been to many many ramen places from the west to the east.. and some places in between.",1
5,"There wasn't many ramen restaurants in the area when we were visiting but we gave this one a shot and it did not disappoint! The staff was friendly and the space was pretty standard. 
The ramen was super tasty and had a perfect broth. I loved how you can order the tenderness of your noodle!
Sushi apps were pretty good too!",1
2,"Good food, terrible service.
A week ago we went to another Shoryu location (Carnaby street) and after a short wait in line we were promptly seated and served impressively quickly.
At the New Oxford location today, we arrived and were seated without a wait but then we waited over 25 minutes to have a server show up and take even our drink order. This was despite asking various servers multiple times to place an order and always being deferred. The place was almost full but not really busy so the poor service was pretty inexcusable.
After eating (tasty food), our bill had major issues twice (once it was just unrelated; the second time it had a number of extra items). Finally, a manager had to help correct the bill. We had to ask twice for the service charge to be removed.",-1
3,"Heatwave in London. Warmest summer ever and what better than a super hot face melting bowl of Ramen!  Gambate! Itadakimaaaas!
I peeked over the door noren and I see this place is packed already. I guess I wasn't the only one mad in the brain to eat hot ramen on a hot day. Anyhoo.. I held up 4 fingers and the hostess seemed to know I meant .. table for 4.  So she led me to the tiniest of tables, crammed next to 2 of the tiniest of tables, and with a quick Hai Dozo.. I was left there.  But,... but.... I cannot possible traverse the tiny space between the tables to get my seat on the inside.  I mean.. people were already eating , and their bowls of ramen was perched on their tables, and I would most def, either knock their table over... or even worst.. go past the tables sideways and put my butt right over their table.. So I gave the hostess a helpless look.. ehh...sumimasen... but she looks away.  Fine.. be like that.. so I proceed to wedge myself between table and takes seat.. So uncool. Tho my wife rolled her eyes at me.  
I needed ramen, I needed something to restore my center.  The walking and sightseeing and meal decisions while visiting London has been exhausting.  I needed ramen to get back to basic.  We got us, Dracula Ramen, Regular Tonkotsu, I think there was Spicy Miso too.  tldr;- None was spectacular. It wasn't bad.  But it lacked an identity.  The noodles was text book, the broth standard, the chashu pedestrian, the toppings bleh.  In a sea of ramen.. Shoryu ramen did not stand out one bit.  
Service was so-so.  I don't expect it at a Ramen-ya anyway.  So I was fine with bare minimum.  
I don't know if there is better Ramen in London.  This isn't bad, but I would search harder the next time for something better.",-1
4,"Tasty ramen with the beautiful chew to the freshly made ramen.  Stumbled upon this place since we couldn't find the place we were looking for but, we love finding new gems.  Food was really good, broth was very tasty.  The calpico mojito was very refreshing since it was blistering hot in London.  The chicken karage bun was good but I loved the tonkotsu ramen.  I would have had another bowl of just the broth.  Love the find and will be back the next time I'm in town.",1
4,"After a cold day walking around London, the idea of a hot bowl of noodles sounded great. There was a bit of a line to get in so that was a good sign. Turns out this is a chain. To some, that's off putting or inauthentic. But when done in a respectful way - and tasty way, who cares? When you finally get called for saying they hit a drum and yell something that's supposed to be in Japanese. Cute and sets the Japanese motif. 
I like that you are able to request noodle doneness for the ramen. In general, I found the ramen (we tried two different ones) to be a little bland but otherwise really good. It had the nice soft boiled egg (but with a slightly reddish yolk). The BBQ pork bao was pretty delicious with a substantial piece of meat. The Soho platter was a pretty posh sampler of food including sashimi, tempura, and Kara age chicken for two. They even had a near-frozen Asahi beer that really hit the spot against the fatty broth of the ramen. We skipped the cocktails but they looked really delicious.
We skipped dessert but overall, it was a pretty good meal and surprisingly inexpensive vs. expectations. Would definitely recommend this place for ramen cravings!",1
5,"Who would have thought that there would have been such an awesome ramen place in London? Shoryu Ramen definitely surpassed my expectations.
The broth was flavorful, and the noodles cooked to perfection. Service was great for us, as we came before the rush, as they quickly took our orders and brought out the food in a timely manner. The restaurant is a bit small, but it is nice and cozy. I would try to get here before or after it gets really busy.",1
5,"It was our last night in London....and knowing that we had a long night ahead of reluctantly packing to head back in Atlanta....Hubby and I opted to stop by here for a simple warm dinner, and romantic walk under the Christmas lights on Regent street. 
Shoryu came highly recommended by friends and yelpers. It was a cold night so a warm bowl of ramen seemed like a perfect option. We hopped in a uber and arrived with no reservations made prior. Luckily, it was not too busy despite being a Friday night. We were able to find cozy two seats at the front right corner so we could people watch (very fun on a Friday night). 
I love the detail of purse hooks under the table. 
They offer specials such as seasonal set menu, Bun Monday, and Happy Sake hour. 
Shoryu Ramen started in Nov. 2012 and recommend in the Michelin Guide since 2014 (you still see the sticker at the entrance). They specialize in Hakata Tonkotsu ramen (aka, rich-thick- white pork broth with straight ramen noodles). Ricky and I both ordered the same Shoryu tonkatsu ramen ....and the broth was amazing! You can tell it has been cooking for many hours with great quality ingredients. And do not forget about the noodles made from fresh Shoryu flour! Fresh, bouncy, and chewy. You can request different textures to your liking. The ramen comes with the traditional toppings of a soft boiled egg, pork, and veggies,and nori. All the toppings were excellent as well.....but I am a BIG soup and noodles person so those are the items that grabbed by attention the most. 
The gyoza is supposed to be really good here but unfortunately no one told me -_-. I didn't find this out till after I left the restaurant. The uber driver asked me if I got the dumplings on the ride back to the hotel. We got the takoyaki instead which was so-so. 
Another popular item is the HIrata Bun. Hubby got the wagyu beef filled bun. They names it the Shoryu bun to bring prosperity to you when you eat it :) Very cute. 
This location also has quiet an extensive alcohol selection. Def check this out. There was a reason everyone inside was drinking lol. 
Highly recommend. Great place for ramen.",1
4,"Went for early dinner,  and got four bowls of ramen. All were good. The Curry Ramen was very spicy. My son, who can handle almost anything, could not eat the whole bowl. Mine was good, too, but needed a little soy sauce to heighten the flavor. Drinks were a little high.",1
5,"Loved this place so much my first time in London I made my group come back on my next visit. The ramen is tasty and authentic and leaves me satisfied every time.
We came in Monday which turned out to be Bun Monday (buy one get one free)! We came in around 2 pm and we're seated right away. Keep in mind the later it gets the more crowded because my first time was a 45 minute wait in the evening.",1
5,"I've never had ramen before but boy was I missing out. This place was absolutely delicious, very flavourful and surprisingly affordable. Service was amazing and you could tell the staff was really passionate about their food. Will definitely come back again",1
3,"oVery busy and famous ramen restaurant, still have to wait after 10:00 in the night.. ordered the signature ramen and soft shell crab, it was not bad, but little bit disappointed because the taste not as good as o thought",-1
3,"I had such horrible service here which is why I am only giving it 3 stars although the food was a strong 4. 
Service: Took several minutes to get our order taken. Then when we were ready to pay, there was a staff member talking to another staff member on her break at the table next to us. Completely ignored us although we tried getting her attention. Finally got the attention of our waitress (the only one serving the whole place), to ask a question about a discount we had. She gave us an explanation then walked away for another several minutes when we had to flag her down for the bill. Again, staff seated to our left acted oblivious. I don't know how they run a business here.
Food: Very tasty, full of flavour and good portion size. I enjoyed my Dracula tonkatsu ramen. It was hearty and delicious. 
Verdict: I would return to another place gladly, given this poor service doesn't extend to all their locations. Clearly they have good food, they just need to work on hiring good people.",-1
3,"There were two main reasons for dining here: it had been recommended by the Michelin guide and, if you're a fellow Street Fighter fan, then you'll understand the other reason why.
 
Along with our respective bowls of ramen (one Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu, one Dracula Tonkotsu), we also ordered a couple of the Shoryu buns.
Personally I wasn't a huge fan of the buns as they actually had quite a bit of mayo on them. They were still tasty but I would probably pass on them on any subsequent visit.
The ramen was quite good and you have the choice of how you would like your noodles prepared. The broth of the Hakata Tonkotsu was flavorful, savory, and rich. The double nitamago egg was eggsellent. The Dracula Tonkotsu is filled with tasty garlic bits and flavour but may require an after-meal mint. 
3.5 stars overall.",-1
4,"Was visiting London with my fiance, and after a long day of walking, we were craving a carb-heavy meal like ramen. We stopped by shoryu, which was decently busy on a weekday late afternoon. We were asked to wait outside for a few minutes as they were cleaning the tables. 
I got the dracula tonkotsu and my fiance ordered the tonkotsu with the more intense/ thicker broth. We both enjoyed our meal - you can order the noodles cooked to your preferred doneness (standard, firm, etc.) and the egg that came with the noodles was cooked perfectly. My soup base was a little too garlicky for my tastes, but that was my fault since the description clearly detailed that it was for garlic lovers. My fiance said this was probably one of the better ramen places he's eaten at (and we've been to plenty in Chicago and NY)
The meal was a little pricey for what it was, but we were in the heart of London so I expect part of it was due to location so can't really complain there.",1
2,Hey man this joint got no flavor. I wish I can ask the chef for a refund. I should've stopped by tesco express to add some spices and real ingredients. Please save your money and go elsewhere.,-1
5,"Best Ramen ever!!
Curiously, when taken apart the individual ingredients are really good, but not my favorite.  I prefer thicker noodles, the perfect egg and more Kimchee.  However, it is this combination that adds to perfection.
I had the Spicy Seafood Tonkotsu.  I am delighted by these scallops that have a firm texture and full-flavor (being used to farm-raised ones).  The Ramen is not spicy and you can add chili oil and grind fresh sesame seed to taste.
My companions have the pork version that they love.  With a bit extra, you can have a Shoryu bun and a boozy cocktail with your meal.
Great if you love Ramen!",1
4,"Super rich broth...very tasty. I have actually never had someone ask me how I like my noodles cooked...that was a nice touch. I've had really good ramen and this place is up there in the ranks of the best. The service was good, attentive, friendly. Skip the frozen beer slushy...it just makes it take longer to get to your actual beer. Definitely a must taste if you're in the area and hungry or jetlagged or hung over. It's a comforting bowl of brothy meat love to cradle your heart!",1
4,"Stopped here for lunch because I was craving a bowl of ramen. 
I ordered the Origin Tonkotsu (£10). I had my noodles cooked normally and the ramen came topped with pork belly, mushroom and green onion. That was actually perfect because I wouldn't eat the egg anyway. The noodles here are the thinner kind, not the chewy thick ones (I prefer the thicker noodles). The bowl was kind of small. Normally, when I eat ramen, I get a bigger bowl with more soup. 
The soup was good, but nothing mind-blowing, especially when they advertised their soup to be 12 hour soup.
The service was quick and efficient. I really liked how if you asked for tap water, they gave you a whole bottle, even though I was only 1 person.  
Overall, the ramen was good. I don't have a lot of experience eating ramen in London, but I do have a ton of experience eating ramen in SF and this was ok compared to the kinds I've had in SF.",1
5,"Went to London on holiday came here, and now I'm depressed that I'm back home in Cardiff instead of being able to eat here every day.
Honestly - if I lived in London and could afford to do so, I would eat here EVERY DAY. NO. JOKE. I'm STILL thinking about those perfectly seasoned eggs. No wonder they're on the Michelin recommended list two years in a row!
~ Atmosphere:
Cute atmosphere - nothing fancy. The wall has a great description of the parts of ramen, if you're new to this amazing dish you can read up on it! Even though I'm a ramen fanatic, I still learners a bit about the ramen styles of different regions in Japan.
~ Customer Service:
Really lovely. The waitress who served us was very sweet and friendly, and our food came out at a decent time (not alarmingly quick like they do in Japan, but still at a relatively decent time). They also provide fresh garlic you can crush right into your ramen if you're a garlic fanatic like me.
~ Food:
This where the 5 stars comes from. Everything else could be literally GARBAGE and I would still give this place 5 stars. We ordered Pork Belly Buns to start off with and they were fantastic. I'll be honest - I've had better baos elsewhere so next time I come I'll probably skip on the baos and go straight to the ramen just to get a better taste value for money.
I ordered the Dracula Ramen (garlic tonkotsu ramen) and it was out of this world. You can order extra toppings so I opted for an extra seasoned egg. After I finished my first plate of eggs I wish I had no shame and order an extra plate. You're also allowed to ask for extra noodles or meat - all at a price of course but I'm definitely glad they had that option available.
Choose the firmness of your noodles and you're ready to go - the result? The most AMAZING ramen. The depth of flavour of my ramen was immense and you can definitely bet that I slurped up all the remaining broth after I was done. If you're a ramen snob and here to compare Shoryu to the other ramen powerhouses of the world, I would say that the broth is what sets this place apart. The char siu was forgettable, but the broth and eggs were UNFORGETTABLE. I'll be thinking about this ramen for years to come.
---
Do yourself a favour and get to Shoryu Ramen. Probably the best in London.",1
2,"Service is pretty poor.
Went with a few of my colleagues and we all ordered the Ramen and some drinks.  It actually took about 15-20 minutes for us to get any type of drinks and we had to remind the waiter about our drinks.  After we had the sake and it helped a little bit more.
Ramen:
No taste, no flavor.  BLAND.  Noodles were good.  That's it.",-1
5,"Clean contemporary restaurant.  They announce each groups arrival with a beat of a mini Taiko drum.  
I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen made with a 12 hour Pork Bone stock.  The bowl of Ramen was served with Nitamago - soft boiled egg well executed, Kikurage - wood eared fungus adding a good crunch, Nori - seaweed - adding crunch and umami flavor, generous amount of fried Shallots, a bit of spring Onions, a dollop of red ginger with a sprinkling of Sesame Seeds.
The Pork Bone Broth had the requisite umami flavor, without being too salty.  The Ramen Noodle were excellent- the Noodles were al dente and the Noodles captured the flavor of the broth well.
The best part of the bowl was the BBQ Pork, thin sliced, delicious Perhaps a more generous portion would make the experience more enjoyable
Bottom line - This is a Ramen I could eat several times a week.  It was delicious, not overly salty, has a sophisticated home made quality to it.",1
5,"This is one of the best places I've ever eaten! Too much to write, I had the soy based ramen, hard noodles. It was absolutely delicious. Go there you will love the food and atmosphere. In the heart of Carnaby Street. This place is really special.",1
5,"This was not only so flavourful but coupled with great service! The noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was so packed with flavour. I had the Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu, the signature ramen and definitely promises. This was paired well with their saki flight. The place was packed and yet we still didnt have to wait long for our orders. Our server was able to make sure we enjoyed our meal!",1
4,"I really enjoyed the ramen here! I came here a broken & hungover person and emerged a new flower. I had the signature shoryu ganso tonkotsu and the person I was with had the kotteri hakata tonkotsu and both were really really good... just nothing *mindblowing*. We did also get the two most plain ramen bowls though. The service was also outstanding (we wanted to get in, eat, get out and they were super fast/accommodating).
Overall I will definitely return here and try their other menu items!",1
5,Such tasty food! Was in the mood for ramen and hoped they'd have a vegetarian option. I don't always love tofu in ramen but the way they made it was superb - not too soft or bland. Also loved the broccoli inclusion. Servers were very responsive while not overbearing. Would definitely recommend it!,1
4,"Nice ramen joint in London. They offer the typical tonkatsu as well as some interesting varieties like seafood kimchi, white vegetarian and curry. I went for the double tonkatsu broth and had a side of the black sesame tofu as a starter. The tofu was inter sting and a very instagrammable dish but not a must order. Tasted like a black sesame jello as it needed a little more sauce/wetness to it. The ramen itself was very solid. Large portion and tons of noodles. Noodles are hard and perhaps the best I've ever had. The fact that you can pick your thickness is awesome to me and really gives each ramen dish it's own rather than churned out in a factory. Chasu was thick but I wouldn't necessarily call it pork belly as mine had virtually no fat. Broth was thick and meaty, but lacked spice. Even with the piri piri side sauce I was still hoping for more. The ramen did not disappoint and it's no surprise they've expanded throughout the city. Biggest complaint was that they charged for still water when all I want d was tap. An upsell like that hurts and seems very seedy. But food wise, one of the better ramens I've had.",1
1,Inaccurate advertising. No gluten free options whatsoever. Not sure why that's posted or why this keeps coming up as the number one spot for gluten free Noodles. Will keep on looking....,-1
4,"From the States and thought this place compares. Could use more salt for my taste. Had the Kottari and enjoyed. The Tempura Shrimp was good but bland. Again, needing a bit of salt.",1
1,"Service is horrible!!! 
Yelp said they close at midnight but when we walked in at 10:45 they said they close in 15 minutes and we can only order off the ramen menu but no sides... they seated 4 other parties besides us and gave everyone else a menu but my boyfriend and I literally had to wave down a server to get a menu. 
The ramen came out fast which is good and it was delicious.
However when the check came they had the audacity to add service charge to the check without my consent. Coming from America I know to tip!! The service charge was a huge turn off not to forget to mention illegal!!!!",-1
5,"We had spent four hours at Houses of Parliament already, so by the time we were done at 2:30 pm, we were hangry. We found Shoryu Ramen via Yelp and immediately looked for the closest red double decker bus to take us there. Even though ramen is not the first thing you think of in terms of British cuisine, we were happily surprised to find the food worthy in the name of Japanese ramen. BF found it better than some of the ramen places in Los Angeles, and that's saying something! 
We ordered two bowls of the tonkotsu ramen (which includes char siu barbecue pork belly, nitamago egg, mushrooms, spring onion, sesame, ginger, and nori seaweed) and the recommended shoryu buns (2 for £7.50). We loved the ramen more than the buns and a bowl of ramen will do more than enough to keep you full. Sit by the window for people watching!",1
5,"Very good.  After a long day of touring and a long week of pub food, Shoryu was a great relief.  Funny enough i never had ramen before coming to the UK and it made me a fan.
Service was good, it was a busy day for them and they still knocked it out of the park with us.  Next time in London i'll be back!",1
4,"2nd time ar Shoryu but 1st time at the Regent Street branch and its still in my top 3 ramen place in London!!!!
This time I had the Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu and still an amazing broth really meatier as advertised 
Plus the happy hour on all cocktail is worth it had the new seasonal wake me up in Tokyo",1
3,"Ramen is not bad but side dishes are bad! Chicken karaage is made of white meat, very dry. Why not try red meat? Seaweed salad has a whole bunch of other things in it. Can you just serve a simple seaweed salad? And no wasabi in it please.",-1
5,"One of my favorite ramen in London.
Delicious ramen with good service
Their salad is great!
Fair priced",1
4,"1. Service - our waiter was awesome. Funny guy, and deserves a tip! He recommended what beer to get, and gave us a little run through of what to eat as well. There, you wait to be seated, order at the table, and pay at your table.
2. Price - Prices may vary depending on what you order. But regarding on Ramen dishes only, it can be from 11 to 15 pounds. 
3. Ambiance - Awesome decoration. Looks fitting and petit.
4. Food - My wife and I both had the Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu. This is their signature ramen noodle soup. We thought it was flavorful and very filling. It is prepared in Pork broth, Char Siu BBQ Pork, Nitamago Egg, Kikurage Mushrooms, Spring Onion, Sesame, Ginger, Nori Seaweed, and fried shallots. 
5. Cleanliness - Food and tables were clean, but toilet didn't flush so nicely that night I was there.",1
4,"Got our fill of ramen. The tonkatsu was flavorful and the ramen itself firm yet springy as i like my ramen. 
Order the miso with karage chicken ramen and slurp every drop of the soup. The chicken crispy yet moist.. very yummy. 
Disappointed we didn't try the signature bun.. another trip for sure. 
Seating was fast and easy for lunch.. will be back",1
5,"Really really good ramen place in the heart of London. It apparently was nominated for a Michelin star?! I've been to ramen everywhere in the States, and I have to tell you, this was some of the best I've ever had. We ordered the karaage and spicy mentaiko appetizers as well, which were wonderful. The karaage had the perfect amount of crunch and the mentaiko was delicious without being overbearing (p.s. add some soy sauce to this if you'd like!). The ramen noodles had good texture and the broth was perfect without being too salty or heavy. I honestly ended up drinking the entire bowl. The prices are very reasonable (€8 or so for a bowl) and honestly I'm sad we don't have one in the States. A must-stop place for ramen lovers.",1
4,"Travelling from out of the country and needed to try some local ramen. I ordered the Piri Lori Tonkotsu - extra heat, jalapeños, and a secret spicy sauce. Overall I enjoyed the meal. The broth is definitely near the top of my list for the ramen I've tried, and spiciness was a slight kick without being overbearing. The pork was average, and could have used more flavoring and tenderness in my opinion. Variety of noodle selections as well with choices of varying chewiness.
The location itself was nice, with a tendency for couples or intimate dinners, but options for mid-sized and individual stool seating as well. All the staff were very friendly.
Unfortunately they were out of the frozen Kirin when I went, but would definitely be interested in trying if I get the chance to return.",1
4,"Ramen is one of my favourite foods to go out to eat, especially back in my hometown of Vancouver where there is certainly no shortage of ramen shops! 
Since moving to London, I've tried both Ippudo and Shoryu a few times, trying to figure out which one I liked more, and I've come to the conclusion that the broth at Shoryu is definitely tastier. The Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu is fantastic here (the broth, the noodles, and the charsiu all taste great). Sprinkle on some sesame seeds and garlic, and your bowl will taste even better! Service here has also been consistently good, even when the restaurant is busy. 
My only minor complaint is that their ramen eggs aren't as good as what I've had elsewhere (strangely they seem less flavourful?), but still not bad. Certainly not a big enough complaint to detract from the rest of the dish.
I really don't have much else to say that the other 200+ reviews here haven't already said. Shoryu is probably my favourite ramen shop in London, and I will definitely return!",1
5,"Are you serious? Ridiculously good ramen and we've had great ramen! There's a reason this place is 3x Michelin recommended. This takes the great ramen we have had and bumps it into gourmet. Even what seemed like a boring choice, the origin tonkatsu, was surprisingly amazing, full of flavor. My 8 & 10 yo kids left nothing behind. (And they know their ramen.) I had the tan tan ramen as I always order at ramen houses and the egg is organic as evidence by the super orange yolk. The broth had depth and complexity. They use bones and you can tell. 
We were here on Monday so we got the 2for1 bun deal. The prawn buns were the real deal prawn size! The buns were large too, big enough to hold the prawns. The only complaint is that the buns took a long time to come out.",1
2,"Having lived in NYC and LA, I've had some pretty bomb-ass ramen and unfortunately this just didn't match up. I had the most popular tonkotsu ramen  with supposedly extra rich broth. However, I had to add a little more chili oil and soy sauce than I would have liked in order to make it more flavorful. It wasn't terrible but it also wasn't the best and I'm not sure that I'd return. On the positive side, the guy who brought us our water was really nice and friendly :)",-1
5,"Delicious! 
Server wasn't the most knowledgeable or confident but the ramen more than made up for it.",1
4,"It seems like Shoryu Ramen is quite a big name in London, they got the restaurant in couple places. I hadn't heard that yet till when I was in London with my hubby. We were hungry for Asian cuisine, the Shoryu Ramen was one of the few which close to us. Since we both like Ramen, so we decided to head to this one. The restaurant was quite close to Piccadilly Circus and located right on the main street, so quite easy for us to find it. Inside the place was also really nice, It gave me a really nice feeling, the place is clean and modern but also got a Japanese culture in it. Although the restaurant wasn't big, we just like it here. 
When we were here, it was quite busy. It is always a good sign for a good restaurant. And luckily they were still managed a table for two for us, that was nice. After we sat down, we got a look of the menu, wow, lots of nice food in there, I would like to order. Well, I just wanted to try out the Ramen here first. And I forgot that outside of Germany, it is quite common that restaurant will gave free water on the table. We ordered extra drinks, well, got more options anyway. 
I really like the Ramen here, it tasted really good. But again still something was missing compared those I had tried back in Asia, I couldn't really tell what. But again it tasted still really great. I got the idea why this place was well-known here. The price was alright, quite reasonable. I did remember that will recommend to give tips 18%, that was quite a bit much, I think. There was also WIFI in the restaurant, quite convenient for people who need it.",1
4,"One of the better ramen places I've been to in the world, I stumbled upon it accidentally while returning some keys to a friend - proof that there's a silver lining in everything.
The first thing you should know is that this place gets very busy, so you might need to wait a bit. The second thing is that the waiters are going to explain the entire menu to you if you say you've never been there before, down to every last detail. It's kind of patronizing.
I love spicy ramen and will almost always pick it over the others. Their menu lists a traditional tonkatsu, but then it also lists a Kotteri Hakata Tonkatsu ramen that has a richer and thicker sauce. There was an unnecessary amount of confusion when I asked if the spicy Piri Piri Tonkatsu was made with the traditional tonkatsu, or the Kotteri - the waitress explained to me what tonkatsu was three times in a row. So I just ordered it.
If you like spicy ramen, the Piri Piri is the way to go. The broth was smooth and silky and had just enough heat to make your forehead sweat a little, but not enough to burn your tastebuds into oblivion. The noodles were perfect, smooth and not overdone. I didn't like that they added raw jalapeno and ginger though. The ginger kind of threw off the rest of the flavor and I avoided the jalapeno because I didn't want my mouth to catch on fire.
If you're in London and have a ramen craving then this is your place. Just be prepared to wait and/or be spoken to as if you were a child.",1
4,"Pretty good ramen - not on par with Ippudo but overall pretty good.
Space is super small (cozy) - you'll be sitting shoulder to shoulder with other customers. There wasn't a wait when I went but since the place is small - I wouldn't be surprised if there was one. 
The pork belly buns were just ok - they put way too much mayo in the buns which took away from the pork belly itself. I'd suggest omitting the mayo all together.
The cucumber dish was alright - just a small cucumber with some sesame oil and hot flakes on top - super bland. It would have been so much better with a little vinegar.
The ramen itself was good - decent portions - toppings were limited and expensive for extras. The noodles were cooked well as was the poached egg. Soup was flavorful and came with good slices of pork. 
Service was nice and friendly. There is free wifi which is always a plus!
Decent place to get your ramen fix - prices are ok for the city - about £40 for a meal for 2",1
5,"I got the special saki flight and the tonkoysu bowl. Perfect flavours. The saki flight at 12 pound was worth the price, it was basically three double shot glasses full of the best saki brand you can buy.",1
4,"We were able to get a table right away. The waitress was helpful explaining to us their menu as it was our first time there. All the food that we ordered were good. We ordered Halloumi & Avocado bun, Shoryu Chicken bun, Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen, White Natural Ramen.",1
4,The ramen had lots of flavor and was a very big portion.  The pork buns were a little small but the pork was delicious. The scallions and red ginger give the ramen a fresh taste while adding heat. There is white pepper. A sesame seed grinder. Hot oil and  sauce to add to your ramen. They only thing that was annoying is they had a gong that was very loud and they banged it every time someone came in.,1
5,"Great ramen place. We came late on a Thursday night and the place was still busy with a nice atmosphere. We started off with a chicken bun each first -- they were great. A thick pancake with cucumber and hoisin sauce with a nice big piece of fried chicken in it. Next we both had a ramen dish, I had the recommended Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu -- which was a nice filling dish. We also had the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu, which was similar to my dish but spicy -- it was really good. If you like spicy food I'd chose this dish over the other one. A nice meal out, about £12 for a bowl of ramen. Not to bad of prices, seen though it's right down the street from Piccadilly Circus. Easy walk to and from the tube.",1
1,"Um, no again.
This place was just as bad as Kanada-Ya but for different reasons. The tonkotsu ramen was so bad we couldn't finish it. The pork buns were smothered in sauce we couldn't finish those either.",-1
4,"Wish I could give this place a 3.5
+ Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu was pretty tasty. Broth was thick and rich. Slightly too salty for my taste but overall well done. The noodles were fantastic and with firmness cooked to order. Pork pieces were nothing special, but the egg was better than most. Minor gripe - the ginger mixed in instead of on the side.
- Gyoza wasn't anything special and overpriced.",1
4,"I'm only giving it 4 stars because I don't know sh*te from shinola when comes to Raman BUT this place was really good.  It was 2 for the price of 1 bun Monday when my son and I stopped in - Bun-tastic was the phase used, bonus points for that.!!!
My son ordered the Gyoza - He loved 'em.  I ordered the raman with pork as well as the pork bun with the chicken bun; all of the above was fantastic.",1
5,"I love this place!!!! Great value for money, staff is very nice, quick service and ramen are just delicious here! My fav is white natural with super hard noodles! A must try is the black sesame tofu!",1
5,Incredible ramen!! Kids loved the gyoza (potstickers) and chicken Kaarage (like nuggets)!,1
3,Not the biggest fan of the soup that they use but the noodles are good. Their curry dishes are pretty good and for Japanese food the price is decent. However the service at this place is pretty bad. Very slow to respond so be prepared to wait 15-20min for them to even get some drinks.,-1
4,"Shoryu was a solid place to get ramen. Everything was flavorful, but it did leave a bit to be desired. The buns were great, and the sake was authentic. The soup I got was good, and I liked the spicy sauce available on the table, but something was a bit off. Although the pork belly was good, it was obvious that it was not very fresh. It was seasoned well, but it shared a similar flavor with the turkey that you'd have a few days after thanksgiving. That being said, I had a good experience here and would definitely recommend going here.",1
2,"Damn fine ramen of the creamy tonkotsu variety which would merit 4 stars but for the terrible service.  Waiters and the manager seemed to ignore our eye contact and repeated polite hand signals, so I had to get up from the table to ask for a menu.  After another several hand signals we were able to order, and received our food after yet another delay.  Unless you're desperate for ramen (no shame in that), I'd recommend avoiding it.",-1
4,"Having been spoiled silly this year with highly anticipated trips to both Ippudo (
yelp.com/biz/ippudo-ny-n…
) and Momofuku (
yelp.com/biz/momofuku-no…
) over in New York city, I was thrilled to see what the city of London had to offer in terms of pork buns and ramen. Behold: Shoryu. The verdict? Better than Momofuku Noodle Bar, but just shy of Ippudo.
Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?
One thing I will say regarding the atmosphere is that Shoryu does an excellent job of walking the fine line between authentic and fusion. Many of the staff are clearly japanese, but the atmosphere is such that you'll be comfortable even if you're a local or a non-Japanese tourist. Seating is both varied and abundant, so you'll be good whether you're a larger party of just an individual like I was. While the ramen can take a bit of time to come out, know that's because it's made to order, and in the meantime you can dig into a pork bun, which you absolutely should. Star Granted. 
Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?
Prices here at Shoryu are comparable to what you'll find elsewhere, with everything inflated just a bit to adjust for currency. Ramen? Twelve pounds. A pork bun? Just shy of a fiver. Considering that these portions are sizable, these are fair prices across the board. Star Granted. 
Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?
I went with a mix of traditional and contemporary here at Shoryu, and the result was a classic pork bun and a more modern 'Peri Peri' spicy ramen. I ended up with a bit of a mixed bag, with top notch ramen and a pork bun that was good but not what I would call elite. 
First? The pork bun. Good? Again, yes, this was a good pork bun, but I was a bit surprised at the simplicity of the auxiliary ingredients. The lettuce was standard iceberg, and while the pork was good, the entire thing was drowned in a chipotle mayo of some source that cleaned out a lot of the flavor. Good, but not the best I've had (that's you Ippudo). 
Now, the ramen I will say was easily top tier. I have a pretty exceptionally high tolerance for spicy food, so when I was warned that the peri peri ramen was spicy I more or less brushed it off. Wow. A word to the wise? This is some spicy ramen, and when it came down to drinking the broth I had to stop shy of finishing off the whole thing on account of my throat burning with jalapeno seeds. Having said that, the chicken and seaweed and egg and noodles were phenomenal, and this was pretty close to being on par with the best ramen I've had over at Ippudo.  Excellent. Single Star Granted. 
Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?
While it's not the best ramen and pork bun combo I've ever had, for now Shoryu is the best I've found in the city, and that warrants a fourth star overall. Star Granted.",1
1,"At first I thought it's a good place to bring friends there, showing them Japanese food style, but the problem is I only ordered one set but the restaurant charged me extra one , that's 22pounds! And no one remind me there is something wrong with that!",-1
3,"I'm gonna give this place a 3 unfortunately as they kept messing up our bun order (it arrived 3 times!). Also, I asked for some spicy sauce and they chargd me £1 for it. If it wasn't free (which it should be in a ramen place) then at least give a heads-up to the customer so they can decide.",-1
5,"Must try!! The service was great and the food was excellent! My new favorite ramen place in London! 
Shoutout to Georgia our waitress for being awesome! :)",1
5,"Came here via Yelp late at night 23:00 and it did not disappoint. Service was friendly and the food was great. Ordered Salt and Pepper chicken which was hot and crispy, Waygu Beef Bun and BBQ Bun and they were delicious- especially the Waygu. Also had the Curry ramen and it was tasty (not as spicy as I would like but very good anyway). The only ""negative"" thing was the drum - they hit it twice for every party that came in or left. But not annoying enough to not rate this tasty place a five star.",1
4,"After watching a certain Youtuber rave about this place, I decided to go check it out. Unfortunately, the taste was not as spectacular as the way the Youtuber sold it-- or maybe we just have different taste buds. 
The spicy ramen was not that spicy. It didn't have a particular ""kick"" to it. It was too bland. The vegan option was interesting because the broth was made of soy. I got the original. It was good but it wasn't something that stood out to me. The meat, tho, blew me away. It just melted into my mouth when I took the first bite. 
Overall, the service was great and the food wasn't bad! It's just that I've had better in my day.",1
2,"I'm kind of disappointed at this restaurant. First, I waited 45 minutes to eat ramen at around 9pm on Saturday night. They say they are recommended by Michelin in different years but I don't seem to find them on the Michelin website. I tried the recommended Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu ramen. I'm so disappointed. The soup is not think, the meat is bland, the egg is bland. They say they marinate the pork and egg for a long time but they don't taste like that. The takoyaki is different from the ordinary ones as they are deep fried. So it's crispy outside. It's £6.9 for 5 pieces but in each one, there's only a tiny piece of octopus. The rest is just dough. It doesn't worth the price. It doesn't worth the wait.",-1
5,First time and the ramen is delicious and the service is good.  The drinks are superb.  Very happy customer!,1
1,"The wait was long and they left us in the cold outside!
The staff gave us the wrong information about the Valentine's menu and forgot my order!
The worst was the supervisor who ignore our calls and pretended we didn't exist. Only saving grace was the ramen which was nice.
Will not recommend becoz of terrible service. The Japanese way has been totally ruined by the supervisor.",-1
4,"I love ramen on chilly nights and that's where we headed after church on a Sunday evening. We got seated fairly quickly, although by the door. We found out how odd that was after we went to washroom and found the entire back of the house empty. Oh well. 
The food was delicious, hearty and warming to the belly. I got the spicy ramen and it was a little spicier than I anticipated but yummy nonetheless. The only thing I'd say I don't like is that the portions are smaller than any other ramen restaurant I've been to and the prices are a tiny bit higher, so the value isn't quite there. Usually, I have difficulty finishing my portion but I probably could've eaten a few more bites after I was done this time. Maybe don't come if you're starving but it's a good small meal if you're not terribly famished.",1
5,"A lovely place with a good and fast service.
It was fully booked when we we there, but we got a fast service.
We took two ramen, one of them was vegetarian. And two buns to taste with cheese was perfect and with shrimps was less tasty. But overall I'll recommend this place.",1
5,"The best ramen I had in London so far! This place is amazing if you want to try the original ramen and feel the taste of the rich broth they made. 
I've ordered the Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu and was amazing! from the broth to the pork and the noodles were just perfect. You can also choose how you want the noodles to be cooked (from standard to soft to hard). Portion was big enough, staff is nice and friendly, place is not too loud so you can enjoy a chat before and after. This place is also located in a nice spot: not far from Piccadilly circus but not in the heart oh Soho = no queue! That made our Thursday dinner perfect!
If I want to be super picky  (as I am,unfortunately) the only cons is: only one toilet for the entire restaurant!You will see people queuing  in front of it which is not great as it is close to the tables so if you are not lucky enough to be close to the bathroom you could end up with people behind you queuing for the loo. 
Apart from that, great experience and great food!Will definitely come back soon.",1
5,"I've been to Kanadaya, Bone Daddies, and other ramen places but this is my favorite! Had the thicker broth version of tonkotsu ramen, and the soup was thick and flavorful. The noodles are went perfectly with the broth ! (Which wasn't the case for some other ramen restaurants) The waiters and waitresses are also very welcoming and nice :)",1
5,"One of the best tonkotsu ramen in town. Highly recommended! They beer range is also very good. Polite and informative staff, decent prices and nice atmosphere. 
I like the fact that this chain keeps expanding in London!",1
1,"Michelin Guide ""recommended"" my ass. Six hours after eating I woke up all nauseous in the middle of the night. Proceeded to rush into the bathroom with mud butt diarrhea and then vomit. 
Aside from the bout of foodborne illness I'm currently experiencing, the food was less than mediocre at best. This was my first time here and I ordered the Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu. The tonkotsu broth is nothing to write home about (incredibly bland for boasting that it takes 12 hours to cook), the chashu was flavorless, and the noodles were... well, comparatively similar to everything else that's supposedly good about their ramen. When the ramen was brought out, the broth and egg were cold but the noodles were hot. At the end, I couldn't bring myself to finish the bowl and that's rare as I normally devour ramen instantly.
Overall, 10/10 would AVOID this place like the bubonic plague.",-1
1,"I've been coming to Shoryu for years so this recent visit was extremely disappointing because I am familiar with their usual level of service and quality of food. 
When I was seated I sat there for maybe ten minutes before I had to ask someone for a menu, while other parties were sat after me and given menus right away. These same parties were also given the opportunity to order before I was. I made eye contact with several waiters, signaling that I was ready to order and they ignored me, continuing to chat to each other behind the counter. It wasn't until another ten minutes that I was given the opportunity to order. 
I ordered my usual prawn tempura shoryu bun and a piri piri tonkotsu. When the shoryu bun comes out, there is usually a wrapped wet wipe so that you can clean your hands before you pick up the bun but they didn't give me anything and I had difficulty getting anyone's attention again so I just gave up and ate the bun which tasted great, as usual. When my tonkotsu came out, the nitamago was really overdone to where there was no runny yolk quality, and about 90% of the yolk was a crumbling yellow rather than a silky orange. When I asked for another egg, the waitress asked what was wrong with it and I told her it was overdone and how it's supposed to be soft boiled (I had to explain to her what a proper nitamago looks like while I'm sitting in front of a chalkboard with the definitions of the different elements that make up a ramen, one of which is a definition of a nitamago). She came back with another egg that was still over cooked but better than the my initial egg claiming ""this is the best we've got"".  Other than the egg, the ramen was delicious. 
Finally, when I asked for my check they brought me the bill right away and I sat with my credit card in my hand for maybe 15 minutes before I had to again ask if I could pay. A new waitress came and asked if I wanted to pay by card, and I asked her if the 12.5% service charge could be taken off because out of all the years I've been here I've never experienced such awful service. She just sulked away and came back with an adjusted bill, not once making an attempt to ask why I felt that way or inquire as to what they could do to improve. She merely processed my transaction in complete silence and then walked away. 
I would also like to add that I was not the only one experiencing poor customer service. There was a six-top of Australian diners behind me who asked for water from at least three different waiters and also said they were ready to order, to which the waitress who processed my bill replied in a really harsh and rude tone ""it's coming! I've already asked!"" And another waiter turned up and told them ""you're just going to have to wait!""
I usually go to the carnaby branch so maybe it's my mistake for going to a different location but I've been to this location in the past too. I don't think I will return to this branch but look forward to going to another branch soon",-1
4,"I was actually at the location at Carnaby St. and when I went to go check this place out on yelp, I didn't realize that Shoryu was a small franchise and that there were several locations around London. The place on Carnaby St was small, but cozy and pretty lively on a Sunday night. I was seated at the booth and started to chat up with the bartenders. It was my first time, so they explained that they specialize in tonkotsu ramen and went through the pretty large menu with a lot of different ramen options and side dishes. I decided on the Kimchi Seafood tonkotsu because I love spice. I was also able to customize the texture of my ramen (standard, hard, super hard) which I thought was interesting as I have never had that option given to me before. I also got gyoza (because obviously you should get that with every ramen dish) as well as a steamed pork belly bun to start. Also, if you like lychee, definitely try the pink lychee jasmine tea, you won't regret it! 
The steamed bun came on the mini wooden steamer which I thought was super cute and the pork belly was super flavourful and the bun was also very soft and delicious. The gyoza I absolutely loved!! The crispy layer on the dumping as well as the filling were SO good and not overly salty. I definitely wish I ordered more. The ramen itself was definitely good, but I found the broth to be standard and definitely not as spicy as I wished it to be. It was very mild. I loved that they were very generous on the seafood and I had a lot of it in my ramen. Great sized portion and reasonably priced! 
While it wasn't busy, I found the service to be a little slow. Overall, I was pretty happy with the place and I probably would return if I could!",1
5,"We went to a Japanese restaurant in soho and found it shut earlier this evening. It may been closed due to the bank holiday plus gumball 3000 was on in regent street. 
We ended up walking round and found this place! I went in to ask for a table for three and was told it was bout 15 min wait, and the queue was outside, as no room inside to stand! 
They do have a heater outside so it's not too bad. 
When we got our table, they explained how the menu worked with the different styles of noodle and the bun offer where you can get 2 for 1 if you order ramen noodles.
We decided to try the buns, and ordered one pork one and a chicken one. We each had noodles and two of us ordered an extra half boiled egg each. You can have the noodles al dente, standard or soft. The original ramen dish was nice, I really liked the egg, it was soft boiled.
I had a mocktail strawberry kusu mojito which was very refreshing. 
The place is small, but looks great, the staff are nice though we found our waitress a little hard to understand and had to go back and ask her what she meant.
My friend did order more buns to take home to her husband as they were nice.",1
5,"Wow! It was a toss up between here and Bone Daddies and we settled on this beauty. Being relatively new to Ramen I was excited to try another place and another type.
We arrived and had to wait 10 minutes for a table. Be warned: You do have to wait outside for tables so maybe not the best option if freezing or raining but we were happy to wait as it was a mild night and it smelt so god damn good!
We were seated on a long bench by the wall, at first we were a bit disappointed not to have a proper table but in the end we quite enjoyed it.
We ordered the gyoza and pork and prawn buns to share. Then I ordered the curry ramen in the others section.
The sides came first which I was glad about being staring. The gyoza was freshly cooked and mouth-wateringly good. The pieces of meat inside were chunky and they just went down a treat!
Now, to the buns, it was the first time I'd ever had a 'bun' and I absolutely LOVED them. Whatever that weird type foldy bread is, it's amazing and the toppings were superb. I particularly liked the belly pork! NOW.
Next, the ramen. Gosh it was good - garlic, curried soupy goodness with bites sized pieces of friend chicken breast, veg, seaweed and egg floating within. Just perfection. The curry had an almost katsu taste to it which I enjoyed and with the extra clove of garlic, I was in a ramen dream. It was slightly salty but I am a fan of salt so no complaints here! 
Service was fantastic and the overall ambience of the restaurant is relaxed and warming. We left full, satisfied and saying we'd definitely be back again.
Happy Saturday!",1
2,"Typical Tonkotsu place.  Nothing special, frankly, it's really over-hyped.  Ramen could have been out of preserved or dried packages, Kimchi was not especially tasty (probably made more palatable for unsophisticated western's taste) and the shrimps on the seafood's Tonkotsu seemed straight out of the refrigerator, they were cold inside the warm soup which was an unpleasant contrast.
I finished ordering a Macha ice cream which didn't certainly taste artisanal.
If you want to get real Japanese ramen in Europe I'll suggest trying in Düsseldorf.",-1
3,"Pretty disappointed by this place. It looks very sexy with decor etc, but service was really poor - and I was there for dinner at 5.30pm before a show.  I finally got a menu and realised there wasn't much veggie choice (which I guess is to be expected, so that's not a biggie) but I opted for a pancake which sounded intriguing. 
Well, we waited 40 mins for food, and only after enquiring were brought an undercooked and frankly bizarrely chewy dish, minus the advertised salad. I would normally have sent something like this back, but by this point we were in a rush and there seemed to be no point, so I just graciously ate, then tried and failed to pay using Apple Pay. I think this is just not for me, and won't return,,,",-1
4,"This place is nice and comfortable inside. We only waited about 15 minutes to be seated.
I ordered the pork belly bun and the spicy tonkatsu ramen. The pork belly bun had a great flavor profile that was different from most that I have had. It had a sweet, smoky, and light spice to it.
My ramen was quite good except for the pickled ginger. I was not a fan. I ordered my ramen standard, but will opt for the firmer option for chewy purposes.
If you are in the mood for ramen then you can't go wrong here.",1
4,"This was my first authentic ramen experience. Beside top ramen and the local noodle bar, I had a very limited taste palette. As soon as you walk in you get this awesome sense of surrounding. The space is beautifully decorated. Very chic. We sat by the front to get a view of the street and the life outside. Our started was some pot stickers. They came out still sizzling. Very crispy and full. Great way to start. For my main I got the Origin Tonkostu. And wow. Ike nothing I ever tasted. And it was huge! There was no way I could finish it.....but I tried! By the time we left, our bellies were full and swishing. Extremely satisfied with our meals. If you like unique and authentic ramen, this is your place.",1
5,"Just what I needed when touring the Trafalgar Square area. I enjoyed their signature ramen (pork, egg, mushrooms over noodles) and others had the sashimi which was fresh and filling. Excellent service too. Would definitely recommend.",1
3,"We were around Regent/Piccadilly Circus after watching a musical in this area so we stopped by this place to eat Ramen. Their selection of dishes on their menu is wide, so you will find something you like. If you are not familiar with Japanese food, they also have a glossary on their menu in case you have trouble with finding out what you want and need a closer explanation. 
We ordered a Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu, their signature dish with extra meat, and also some fried gyoza. We finished our ramen and also our beer, and waited long for the gyoza. So we had to ask, and it seems they had forgotten about this order. They apologized and made the food right away when we pointed that out, so it was not the end of the world. But normally the gyoza should have come before the ramen as gyoza is considered more as an appertizer. 
So in short this a good place to eat Ramen with good service, but it is not the best Ramen place around this area as they have a lot of competition here.",-1
3,"We got there by sunday lunchtime on a cold day and there was already a couple of people queueing. it didn't take too long though (luckily it wasn't raining) and we were shown to our table. the place is rather small and these were two tables joined together, with table 2 already occupied. i don't know why they couldn't have separated the tables before we took our seats but that's fine, we did it ourselves.
I had a steamed pork bun as a started and the price was quite steep for what is essentially a mini sandwich. The meat was somewhat flavoursome, but a bit dry and sat awkwardly inside the bun, trying to escape as I bit into it. I don't know, presentation wasn't great and I felt there was little value for money. 
I had the traditional ramen with two lovely half eggs and bits of pork that were ok, but not mind blowingly good as the ones I had in Tokyo. The broth was substantial and nicely flavoured, but I must be honest and said I've had better here in London. The price is honest for what you get, though, and I've heard you can get a second portion of noodles free if you still have lots of broth left. For drinks I've ordered a frozen kirin but it came mildy warm and without the foam cap it was supposed to have. I was disappointed to say the least.
Overall the food ain't bad, it's just not awesome enough to make me queue or even go for another visit. And I believe you could have better elsewhere.",-1
5,"GLUTEN FREE RAMEN!!! And also gluten free sides including chicken karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and steamed buns! 
I didn't go full GF as I got the Shoryu ganso tonkotsu but with rice noodles instead of egg noodles. For full GF you have the choice of two soy milk and white miso ramen. My ramen was so deeeelicious and the egg was just perfect. Really good pork too. All in all amazing. 
My husband had the Dracula ramen...woah, he stunk so bad afterwards and we were going to the theatre, hahaha! And yep, it was even worse the morning after. Prepare yourself for the most garlicy dish ever. It was delicious though. 
We also had the traditional Japanese chicken wings on ice for starter, just because it sounded cool. The wings were nice though I'm not sure why they are served on ice...
My husband also got the winter sake flight, 3 types of sake (35ml each I think) for £6.50 with an explanation of what each one was. A great idea to educate people about sake!
There were so many other interesting things here, the sides, the drinks. What a great meal! Will definitely be coming back...is tomorrow too soon?!",1
5,"Perfect, no-nonsense ramen. The soup is not insanely thick like some other competitors'. I like it. Also, their octopus appetizer is fantastic.",1
4,"A nice broth, good taste to the pork, fun staff who rings a gong and meets you with a happy greeting upon entering, and a delicious matcha latte.  I honestly prefer Kanada-Ya, but I may go back here to give it another try (and this time, I will specify my noodle preference because they were much too soft for my taste).",1
4,"Was starving and indecisive so when I turned the corner and saw a large line of people waiting outside of Shoryu, I knew it must be 1.) a new favorite yelp spot or 2.) super good...either way that made up my mind and I joined the line. I ordered their classic Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu and it was just delicious. Aghh buttery and rich and flavorful....aghh im salivating thinking of it all over again. It was about 11 GBP (around $16 USD) for a bowl which is a little more expensive then the $12 bowls I am used to in DC (I guess both are kind of expensive for a bowl of soup when you think about it), then again this is London and everything is expensive here. ANYWAY back to the food. It was delicious and I would definitely give it my recommendation!",1
5,"I don't live in London. I was only visiting for a week. Stumbled upon this little gem. Loved it so much that I haaaad to dine here twice. No shame. Had the pleasure of trying their Tantan, Spicy Miso, Piri piri and Curry. Piri piri was my favorite, but it's definitely spicy. Prepare yourselves! The jalapenos give it an extra kick! Tan Tan would be my second fave. The boiled egg is perfectly made every time too! 
Deco is trendy and modern. Service is hospitable and quick. Lucky for us, when we went both times, there wasn't really a wait. Shoryu is right next to Piccadilly, so perfect for a stroll before or after you wine and dine!",1
4,"London's best ramen restaurant. I like their food. 
But I don't understand why they make people queue even if they have enough tables. That's unfair. That's why I can't give them 5stars.",1
4,"Small ramen shop in Piccadilly. We were lucky to have a short wait since they don't take reservations.
Attentive and polite staff await you in this busy restaurant. I had the kotteri ramen, which was well prepared, flavourful and rich. I decided to go with the extra hard noodles and they were a good choice! The shoyu pork bun did underwhelm a bit; the strength of the sauce and mayo (?) didn't allow you to enjoy the pork. Not worth it in my opinion, but the ramen is worth going back for!",1
5,"The Shiitake & Konbu Gluten Free Soy Broth, Tofu, Kikurage, Seasoned Beansprouts, Sweet Corn, Spring Onion, Sesame, Spinach And Menma Bamboo was some of the best ramen I have ever had. Bursting with so much flavor. It was perfection. I am vegetarian and it is hard and quite rare to encounter ramen that is this yummy. I highly recommend this ramen spot for anyone looking for some quality food with a nice fun atmosphere. 
For dessert I had the green tea cheesecake and the texture and flavor was on point. If I had more room in my stomach, I would have also got the yuzu cheesecake. That will have to be for my next visit to London. 
Amazing food with quality, friendly inviting staff, fun atmosphere",1
5,"Great broth, noodles, and overall excellent variation on this Japanese dish. Loved the piri piri and fresh jalapeños for heat. Definitely would come again.",1
1,"I just tried Ippudo in NYC few days ago where Hirata Buns and Ramen are PERFECT. So basically when you come to Shoryu Ramen in London, the deception is normal.
The Waguy Beef Hirata is BAD, very fatty, the bun doesn't hold and it is drenched in mayonnaise !! (£7.5)
The fried chichen Ramen, is a large portion with several big pieces of Fried chicken (bland) that lost their crispness because of the broth.
The broth is flavourful but nothing compared to Ippudo.
The 1 star is for the location.
The minus 4 stars are basically more for the lack of service i got from the staff.  They are not motivated and not welcoming. I really was about to leave cause i felt i disturbed them. They were several empty seats/table but they offered the one very mext to the main door (bear in mind it is freezing outside and the clients are entering and flgoing out from this door)
When i insisted to get the seat inside that i knew was free they told me no. I was abot to give up but eventually they gave me that seat after mumbling about me.
That is how my experience started at shoryu and believe me l, i was still expecting the food to be good despite the attitude of some staff.
It is very expensive for nothing and no need to say that i won't recommend it.",-1
5,"I bloody love Shoryu! I haven't eaten a lot of ramen but from what I know this is really good stuff! The portions are huge and for the price totally worth it! I had the Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu and it was amazing! Delicious thick broth, succulent pork and perfect soft boiled eggs.
Sure this ramen thing is a bit of a London fad at the moment but who cares?! It tastes great and it fills the hole!
Oh, and they also do FROZEN BEER!!",1
5,"Believe the hype. It's REAL. 
Just a few steps from touristy Piccadilly Circus, this gem is legit. Complex flavor, amazing service, solid recommendations. 
Do yourself a favor and make it here. It'll be worth every slurp of your soup.",1
5,"I was walking and on my way to a different restaurant when I passed by this place. The place had this warm and inviting vibe to it. Or maybe it was the rain that made me want to just grab a bowl of ramen.  So I decided to forgo the steak I was about to go enjoy and walked into this place. The staff was friendly and attentive and seated me right away.  Took a look at the menu and decided on the Kimchi seafood ramen along with the pork and prawn tempura buns along with a sake flight.
Long story short everything was amazing. The buns were perfect and amazing. I wanted more but I had a whole bowl of ramen I needed to eat. So I start the ramen and the broth is just die to for. Perfect amount of heat along with perfectly cooked seafood. The noodles were not overcooked and had the right amount of chewiness. So good that I am promising myself that I will go back on every trip I make to London.",1
3,"A-OK..... that sums it up.
I had the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu for 11.90gbp/18usd, 3pc gyoza for 4gbp/6usd, and a drink.
My bowl was small, so small I finished it even though my mouth was on fire because it was SPICY.  I'm not complaining about its spiciness, but its size...
gyoza. ehh.
US$33.75 for eating alone and leaving a little hungry... no thanks",-1
5,"Amazing ramen noodles I ever have, tried Piri Piri tonkotsu was delicious and their buns are just so good. Definitely would come back and recommend it to everyone",1
5,"Having my fair share of tasty ramen from California, this place is solid. Broth is very authentic and flavorful, noodles are perfect. If you are in the area and in the mood for some ramen, this is the place to go. Keep up and improve further and some day you'll earn that Michelin Star.",1
5,"I've been to many ramen places in southern California, which is crawling with Asian food places including ramen. While studying abroad I was really missing a dose of Asian food and had heard such good things and was so impressed with Shoryu! I think it's the best ramen I've had yet. Now that I'm back in the States, I find myself craving Shoryu all the time. 
I've had the original once in Carnaby, the signature ramen twice and the Dracula once on Regent St. All were so good! The broth is amazing and the egg. Ugh, the egg. Perfect. Just how it should be done! 
Having gone a few times, I found it not filling enough, so I recommend rationing your broth so you can get extra noodles if you're still hungry!
The plum wine is also great. A really nice complement to the savoury noodles. I didn't liked Asian steamed buns growing up but the pork belly hirata buns changed my mind. So good!
Next time I'm in London, definitely making a stop at one of my favorite trendy restaurants!!",1
5,Really fast service and delicious sashimi. My family enjoyed their ramen as well! It was a cool atmosphere with different kinds of seasonings available at your table for customization.,1
4,"What can I say, it's good ramen. Is it the best though? I personally think I've had better...
Shoryru seems to be popping up everywhere and I've had the chance to try both their sit down and takeaway.
It, just like all the others, is first come first served and you need to get there on time if you want to get a place to eat.
As I do, I ordered the Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu ramen, and make no mistake, these noodles are good, the broth flavourful and fatty as it should be. You won't be disappointed going here that's for sure.
For me though, the price is a little high and the noodles just missing a little something something to make it my favourite. I'm a big advocate for making the effort to getting something good and going the distance. In this case, I think I'm going to walk a little further and get something just a bit better...",1
1,Horrible wait and low table turn despite the supposed fast appeal. Indecipherable menu. Slow labor all around.,-1
3,I came back in two years and it hasn't changed much. Food was good. Prawn tempura was perfectly cooked and ramen had good flavors. I would give it a solid 4 stars but the service. There were too many of them but not well coordinated. They seemed to trip over each other.,-1
1,I am writing the review for the first time for those who consider to visit here... The guy who served us very unkind... i would never come here again...we asked some questions and he seemed to be annoyed by our questions and gave scornful look..,-1
3,"All in all the experience was alright. Had heard good things about this chain, so had high expectations for an authentic banging ramen. Was pleasant, though they forgot about our sides.... Also didn't see one Japanese staff.... Was a little odd but I guess they pulled it off ok. In summary, it was ok. The space was pleasant, the service was ok... Erm... Prob a little like an upper end fast food joint though? I dunno.. Maybe I'm too picky? I'll still rate it a 3.5 out of 5.",-1
5,"Delicious ramen!!! And, the Chef (Aris), as well as all the staff, were really nice and friendly.
Ordered a bottle of sake to share for two, and did not expect such a large bottle! Definitely worthwhile :)",1
4,"Delicious, delicious ramen and buns. I got the Ganso Tonkotsu, their signature dish and Shoryu and Chicken Karage Buns. Shoryu buns because it had a lot of great reviews and Chicken Karage because they were having a BOGO special and that was what my waiter recommended. For a Michelin recommended restaurant, they surprising didn't have great presentation or at least presentation that matches their website. The ramen itself is constructed with quality ingredients. I think they use mayo as part of the sauce base which I half enjoyed, because mayo + special sauce is usually going to be pretty good, but also didn't care for since it's mayo...",1
5,"My go-to ramen place. Great service, great food, all in fantastic locations, what's not to love.",1
4,"Stopped at Shoryu Ramen for a late after show snack. It was a great choice. Had their signature dish Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu which is ramen noodles served in a thick rich pork broth and garnished with deep fried shallot, pickled ginger, soft boiled egg, julienned mushroom, and seaweed paper.  We also tried gyoza, salmon sashimi, and tempura tiger prawns. The service was friendly and prompt and the atmosphere is very comfortable. 
Our server suggested two cold sake options that were excellent and provided a new experience for myself. The first was Tarusake which had a black pepper finish but still subtle and flavorful.  The second selection was Nigori cloudy sake which was creamy with real texture.",1
5,"Shoryu Ramen honestly exceeded my expectations. Whoever said that food at London sucks should go check this place out.
I ordered the pira pira ramen and my friend ordered the kimchi seafood ramen. The broth for both ramen tasted similiar: both spicy, thick and DELICIOUS. The egg was perfectly cooked and the pork was soft and tender. I've tried many japanese ramen places in southern california, shanghai, and seoul, and this place was hands down one of the best.
The price was pretty expensive for a bowl of ramen, around 12 pounds. However, in my opinion, the ramen was worth the price and i would definitely come back again.",1
5,"Great atmosphere and menu, and fantastic service. A positive, cool vibe.  Food was excellent. The Curry Ramen was delicious accompanied with a side of kimchi. Perfect lunch.",1
5,"I thought we had happened upon this place by happenstance but it turns out it was part of my wife's masterful plan (she had researched Shoryu Ramen before we got to London). The ramen we both had was some of the richest, most flavorful and aromatic ramen broth we'd ever had. What really got me was the texture of the noodles. They were firm and had a hearty and pleasant chewiness to them. They held up to the powerful broth and abundance of stellar ingredients. It all paired wonderfully with a cold Sapporo.",1
1,"Don't let Eve serve you!! She was rude: not only did she take the order of the couple next to me AFTER she had just seated me first, when I asked her why I had to wait, her response was that I hadn't waved my hand in the air to get her attention. Apparently everyone else in the restaurant could sit respectively, but I was expected to look like an idiot and wave my arms around. Right... Who says that to a customer?!?! She put up a little argument about taking off the service fee also. As if arguing with a customer is common practice. RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL.",-1
4,"Oh ramen, truly some of the ultimate comfort food. I feel as though I was a little too spoiled with my first ramen restaurant experience because I went to one of the top spots in Los Angeles and it was truly incredible. I haven't been able to get the same quality of ramen since but that isn't to say I've been dissatisfied. 
For a chain, Shoryu is quite good and I went twice during my week in London because I love ramen that much. The ramen is definitely better than some that Ive had before which is a good thing. I tried multiple types and they all had unique tastes to them that made them worthwhile. 
Some appetizers were tried as well and they had varying degrees of success. The pork belly buns are good but certainly there are better. The brussel spout tempura...uhhhhh not good. Like wow those were pretty bad.
The restaurant is also quite small, surprise surprise for a London restaurant and the tables are scrunched together like you can't believe. Surely that made things a little uncomfortable but not until a group of stereotypical 16 year old asian girls with jansport backpacks as if they came straight from a Japanese anime sat right next to us. But until I can afford to rent out every restaurant I go to for the night I will have to cope with my middle class problems.",1
4,"Really liked this place. This was the first ramen place to I have been in London and it didn't disappoint! I was here with a girlfriend on a Friday evening and while they don't take reservations - we came here around 7:30pm and waited for under 5 mins. 
The ambience is casual and the service was a bit slow, but the food was delicious. To start we ordered the edamame which was salted and lightly dusted with pepper. And for main course, I ordered the ""white natural"" with gluten free noodles which is served in a soy milk/mushroom  soup with mushrooms and fried tofu among other things. My ramen was quite delicious especially given that it was vegan and gluten free (a rare find!). My friend ordered the original tonkotsu which is a simple dish with pork belly, mushrooms and spring onions in a pork broth. Of course you can always add extra toppings if your heart desires. 
Both of us enjoyed our food and I will definitely return to try their buns which they can substitute with gluten free buns!
PS: The ramen portion sizes are quite adequate. While this time, I didn't try the desserts - they do offer some cool green tea flavoured desserts.",1
4,"I think this was better then Bone Daddies in the soup to noodle ratio.
I dug. The house classic tonkotsu was pretty damn good.
Nice service. 
Would bring friends back here agin.",1
4,"I recently visited a little gem I frequent on Regent Street, London named Shoryu Ramen. Since its opening in November 2012 they have been offering their Hakata Tonkotsu ramen, a recipe which was specially designed by executive chef, Kanji Furukawa. 
Shoryu translates to mean 'to bring good fortune'.
I find Shoryu to be an understated, modest establishment, however its popularity speaks for itself. You cannot reserve a table ahead of time and frequently I spot a line that reaches way outside into the busy streets of Soho. A ringing endorsement in itself and an indication of quality before you even enter the front door!
Their menu is refreshingly simple - as their name suggests, they mainly offer steaming bowls of ramen, amongst other small plates and of course, steamed buns!
I HAD to try their steamed buns as this delicious creation is one of my latest favourites. For those yet to discover these beauties, a steamed bun - as the name suggests, consists of a variety of fillings, encased in a pillowy, fluffy steamed-dough bun
I opted to try two different variations, the Char Sui barbecue pork belly (left) and the soy marinated chicken Karaage (right). Now I'm never short of an opinion, but I REFUSE to pick a favourite, they are both unbelievably spot-on. The pork belly was packed with flavour and smothered in charred-sweet sauce, which married well with the crunch of the salad and the softness of the bun, whilst the contrast of the crispiness of the chicken against the cloud-soft bun was to die for!
You just simply have to try these, plus they offer more variations on their menu, namely; their ginger salmon Tatsutage, their tiger prawn Tempura, and their vegetarian-friendly, grilled Halloumi & Shimeji mushrooms.
Quite honestly, after those two delicious helpings of steamed buns - I really couldn't imagine tackling their rich, generous serving of Ramen - I had to give myself a break! 
But I finally opted for their Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu - their signature 12-hour ramen, but with a richer, meatier broth. 
I loved this dish, it has variety, balance and is the exact antidote to a hectic day, rushing around London. This steaming bowl of warmth allows you to take a much-needed pause.
Ok, I will admit that I had to take half of this serving home to enjoy, however I'd argue that after the flavours were able to muddle for even longer it made for an even more delicious serving. Don't be ashamed to take your ramen on the tube home!
Shoryu Ramen isn't the least expensive establishment you can visit, but its comforting simplicity, packed with flavour keeps me coming back. A would definitely recommend this to anyone who is an Asian-food lover. Or to anyone who has yet to try their first bowl of Ramen or steamed-bun - this is a great place to start!
...And a tip to any Ramen-lover on a budget - you can take a ramen, steamed-bun and a drink to go for just £12 with their go PACKAGE. 
I've only ever visited their Regent St. location, but why not visit their other restaurants located in Soho, Carnaby and Liverpool Street? Does anyone have a preference? Let me know!
Happy Slurping!

4,"Chose to eat an early dinner at Shoryu as it was a short walk from my hotel. 
Their menu seems extensive given the number of pages. 
I chose to start with a Pork Char Siu Bun to start. The Pork Char Siu came in a fluffy bun with sliced cucumber, lettuce and mayo. I liked it, but wish it had a couple of slices of pork. 
They have several versions of Tonkotsu Ramen. I chose the Piri Piri which is their spicy version. All the ramen come with the sliced pork, half a soft boiled egg, mushrooms, seaweed, roasted garlic and thin noodle egg ramen. The broth was rich and thick, but to my surprise not very spicy at all. I kind of wanted more heat, so a little disappointed. I didn't see the red pepper anywhere either. But they do have the fresh garlic in a bucket with the crusher, if you choose to want to squeeze some into your ramen, which I did. I did like their noodles as it was thin and chewy. 
The service was good. And they leave a whole bottle of tap water for you which I thought was convenient. 
For my ramen and pork bun, it was £18.45 which included what they called a ""12.5 optional service charge"". That's strange to me as its already in the total.  Does that mean that I could have left £16.40 and they would have been ok with it?",1
3,This is the place to have a authentic Japanese ramen! The menu variety is not that big. Service is quite fast. Bathroom was dirty - I would expect a cleaner environment for these prices. Thank you for delicious ramen!,-1
3,"Oooh shoryu ramen is another good place to stop for a bowl of noodles, although like Vicky, I liked it, but didn't LOVE it. Maybe all the other new-ish (excellent) ramen places have made it harder to impress me in London?
I was really impressed by the variety of soups here! The menu was massive and it seemed like you can order almost all kinds of noodle-joy. I tried the Sapporo Miso, and my other half tried the wasabi tonkotsu. They were both pretty good...so I'll have to come back and try some other flavours to see if I can bump this place up to 5 stars.",-1
4,"I would eat here every day!
Excellent service, excellent food.
Set menu or a la cart. Really nice place, crowded location, but good service and a manager who cares enough to stop and talk with you and ensure all is well.
Good prices and fast. 
Atmosphere is acceptable, although nothing special.
Go for the food (i.e., Ramen, buns, etc.), it's really tasty.",1
3,"I don't eat pork and presume their tonkatsu is their signature ramen, but their wafu chicken ramen isn't great.  The stock is ok, albeit a bit unappetizing in hue, and the chicken karaage is passable at best.  Kaarage is meant to be marinated, typically chicken thigh and coated in a thin dusting of potato starch or flour; theirs is chicken breast and in a tempura type batter which does not suit being submerged in soup whatsoever.  
Overall a dish not worth spending money on - if they're going to offer a chicken ramen they should at least make a chicken bone broth like Bone Daddies; regurgitating the vegetarian soup and adding chicken seems like a cop-out.",-1
5,"Wow, I love their ramen!  ""Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen"" was super delicious and authentic!!  I chose ""katame (hard)"" for noodles, and it was just right.  Karashi Takana (mustard greens) as an extra topping was also very good but potion was huge! 
I would NOT RECOMMEND ""gyoza"".  It was totally not gyoza.
I went there around 4 pm on a Wednesday. They don't close after lunch hours, which was very helpful for a tourist like me who eat lunch when it's convenient for sightseeing.",1
4,"Other Yelpers are right, the egg is pretty amazing. Rare but not too rare, just perfect. 
I liked the broth, and even though it's kind of odd to have bean sprouts as a topping, it was a nice addition for me (haven't been eating my veggies since I came to London... or wait since I moved out of my parent's house). The noodle is a bit hard, but still pretty good. Green tea was served with a cute little tea pot, nice containers can always make things taste better ;).
Didn't like the mini salad too much. It's a bit too salty, I wish I got gyoza as a side instead. 
What I love the most about this place is that it's not awkward to eat alone at all. I sat  on a communal table and there were 5 or 6 people eating by themselves (most are Japanese). It makes my aloneness doesn't seem as sad.  The staff were friendly and efficient, even though none of them are Japanese they tried to greet everyone with Japanese. 
Besides food and service, the location is great (super close to Piccadily circus) , and the decor is minimal/clean, just the way I like it.  For someone who isn't a ramen geek, I totally enjoyed the experience.",1
3,Went there at 10pm for a quick feed up. Taste almost the same as the ramen I had in US. Nothing special except being a bit too oily for me though but still not bad.,-1
4,"Love how they offer gluten free ramen! But overall, their signature ramen I ordered definately does not beat popular ones back home in SoCal. The broth was very bland, pork tasted a few days old, the boiled eggs were delish! We also ordered the chicken steamed buns and that is a must! Chicken was crispy, sauce was sweet, bun was very soft, veggies stuffed inside were fresh and crisp. So tasty!
Waitresses were very attentive and sweet.",1
5,"Fantastic food in a great space. The place is a great value - easily 5 stars. 
I had the pork ramen and a prawn steam bun. Both were perfectly prepared and presented beautifully. The price was fantastic as well - my fiancé and I were out for less than £30 for the 2 of us - including service.",1
3,"Went recently for a very quick lunch. I loved the starters which were served promptly but I came here for the main event of ramen. It was cold and I needed arming up.
Compared to say Bone Daddies or Kanada-Ya all not far from here, I was quite disappointed. Did I come on an off day? I got the original Ramen Tonkotsu, which I didn't think had any depth of flavour. Pork belly also far too fatty for my liking.
I'm willing to come back one day but it did put me off considering I could easily compare it to it's rivals in Soho.",-1
4,"Japanese remen ( noodle ) great located , staffs really warm welcome! And noolde is so great! But sushi is soso ( dragon roll ) 
But overall its really great restaurant",1
5,"This is the best ramen I've had in London and the best I've had in NYC as well. 
Its potentially true that the bao is not 100% perfect. I want to say maybe 98%? Some times there is a tiny bit more bun than filling and they can put a .5 gram of too much mayo on it - that's all I'll concede.
Add to that its reasonably priced and the service is fantastic and I will come back here again and again. The only downside is that the quality is quite good so one can then eat a lot - one time I both ate a lot and took down some beer. Its hard to go back to work after that - you kind of want to go have an afternoon nap.
Really cannot over recommend this place.",1
5,"Best ramen I have had in London. 
I can't wait for them to expand in NYC and Or LA. My waitress Noelle was exceptionally amazing are her service. I wish for her to serve me my next visit. I had the Fish cakes that were to Die for, the Kotteri ramen and the TAN TAN Ramen are highly recommended. Thank You",1
4,"That is a decent Ramen like the one I'm used to find in California. I had the classic one with Pork, mushrooms and the half cooked egg. Ordered and Served promptly, Finished the bowl in a couple of minutes. Even Forgot to take a picture! I will go back there anytime!",1
3,"I am a big fan of ramen and am always up for discovering the best shop around town. There are two Shoryu around Piccadilly Circus, which is a highly touristy area, so I am already a bit suspicious. 
Though a gong is rung every time a customer comes in or goes out of the shop, it doesn't make the place more Japanese. Maybe most of the servers are not Japanese or the restaurant just doesn't have the coziness which is typical of Japanese ramen places. 
I went there for lunch, so I just ordered Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu which is their signature ramen. Anybody who is into ramen knows that the broth is what makes or breaks ramen. Their broth is ok flavor-wise, but nothing really jumped out at me. The toppings include pickled ginger, fried shallots and black wood ear in addition to the usual roasted pork and egg. Overall, it was a good bowl of ramen but that's it. 
Shoryu offers a lot of side dishes ranging from sashimi, pork buns to chicken wings, which are not food you would see served at an authentic ramen shop. Call me all fashioned, a good ramen place to me should have just a few options of ramen and limited number of side dishes. Shoryu seems to be a Japanese restaurant that caters mostly to tourists and serves all sorts of Japanese dishes, one of which happens to be  Ramen. If you are looking for great ramen place, I wouldn't recommend it, but if you want some decent Japanese food in the area, this is not a bad choice.",-1
3,"Stopped by on a cold London afternoon to some comfort food. The wait staff was very welcoming, walking me through the menu and different options. I ordered their Tonkotsu ramen, gyoza and pork bun. I thought all of the food was very average, but not bad. The tonkotsu broth lacked something, but it was not flavorful enough while the noodles were a bit soft for my taste. Not a bad bowl of ramen but not one that is memorable. The gyoza was presented on a sizzling skillet, very cool. However, the flavor of the gyoza stuffing was also lacking something, perhaps sesame oil? The pork bun used a miso paste of some sort and was my least favorite thing I ordered that day. Okay for a quick bowl if you're craving one but probably not one I would recommend people to go out of their way to get. They do have free wifi.",-1
3,"Why is everything in london so expensive... Came to london for a vacation, mid week through our trip of course I start to crave asian food and whats better than a hot bowl of ramen?
Shoryu specializes in tonkotsu soup base which is my favorite.  They have different option for the thickness of the broth.  If you are used to eating ramen def go with the rich broth option as their regular broth was a little on the bland side.  I love the egg as its the perfect yolk consistency.  Service was pretty good also, very fast and attentive.  
While the noodles are pretty good here, it is hard to stomach the fact that I spent almost $100 US dollars here for 2 bowls of ramen, 6pc gyoza and an icecream dessert.  It cost like $30 for a bowl of ramen and $5 to add just an egg...if you are a local then definitely check out this place as their ramen is pretty good but if you are travelling from NY i would say to skip it and save the $.",-1
4,"A few days ago, I came across this busy and surprisingly delicious Japanese cafe. What makes it surprising is that I was expecting a traditional bao, but in fact it was a mixture of 3 of my favorite infused ethic flavores combined in one bao bun.  Japanese karaage chicken, topped with Korean gochujang sauce and placed between a Chinese style bun. Wowee Bao-ee!! So much flavor bursts exciting my taste buds! Definitely glad I tried that. My Japanese fruit infused mojito and green tea cheesecake for dessert topped it all of to perfection!",1
5,"I rarely give five stars for ramen because I enjoy a particular style and that is tonkotsu broth and not many places do it well.
I walked into Shoryu for lunch solo on a weekday afternoon and didn't have to wait for a seat. The place was pretty packed for lunch.
I got a Dracula ramen which is tonkotsu with garlic. Garlic oil, garlic chips, fresh minced garlic, which as one can imagine, gets a pretty strong flavor. Let's just say I wasn't kissing anyone for the whole day or even opening my mouth because I could've killed someone with my breath. Was it worth it? You bet.
The broth was rich and flavorful and the flavors melded together for a heavenly experience. The ramen came with half an egg perfectly done and three slices of fatty chashu. What I REALLY enjoyed was that there was some ginger in the broth, which really contrasted well with the garlic. Anyone can throw garlic inside tonkotsu but not everyone can layer flavors like a Korean girl layers clothes. My only grouse is that there was half an egg. Just give me the whole damned egg already. Thank you.
I haven't written my Bone Daddies review yet but tldr;
I would choose Shoryu over Bone Daddies. 
I have noticed a distinct difference in the crowds at both places. Shoryu has a more Asian crowd and Bone Daddies seems to have a hipster crowd. Different strokes for different folks.",1
5,"Just as good as the other Shoryu chains. Key advantage of this one is that it's less busy and hectic than the other locations that are in higher footfall areas.
Food is extremely consistent and I have difficulty spotting any differences between this place and the Soho branches.
Most of the tables here are for 2 people so if you're an odd group you'll probably be seated on a group table, by the single seaters at the window or I guess they can merge some tables together.
Check out my other reviews if you want to know what the food is like.

3,"We looking for a a quick noodle fix before our train back to Birmingham. This looked liked the go to place for ramen and it didn't disappoint. Up on arrival into the small restaurant a bong sounded and all the staff greeted us in unison. A unique if not strange touch. The two of us had traveling bags, so chose a 4 seater table. Even this was a squeeze. I went for the shoryu pork ramen and my partner went for the curry flavoured chicken ramen. we had pork buns on the side to share. The dishes came quickly and were well presented. I really enjoyed the pork broth and the slowed cooked egg was perfect. The pork buns though seemed a little unloved and a bit thrown together. Overall a decent quick cheap eat.",-1
5,"Great Natural Miso Ramen, great flavours. It was the only ramen suitable for vegetarians. Besides the Ramen the Harata buns Tempura shrimp and halloumi were great. It would be great if they had more vegetarian selections.",1
1,"This is not a Japanese ramen. I ordered chicken ramen and the taste was bland and my friend ordered pork based ramen but he said it tastes so bland. The price is expensive, there is no Japanese thing in this resto and the matcha taste bitter, it is like cheapest matcha which you can find in supermarket. I used to stay in Osaka Japan, and my descendant is Japanese, I know exactly this is not made by Japanese hand. They also asked for tips which makes it worst.",-1
4,"Although I personally prefer a simple tonkotsu ramen, they have quite the variety for those that are more adventurous. I found the overall experience and food better here than Bone Daddies. The fried chicken at Bone Daddies is better though!
The Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu broth was rich and flavorful. The pork belly buns were.delish!!! Soft and tender pork bursting with flavor with a mild spicy kick on some fluffy buns. The fried chicken could have been crispier but had good flavor.
Pork belly Hirata bunsChicken Kara Age Fried Chicken- crispy deep fried soy, garlic, and ginger marinated chickenShoryu Ganso Tonkotsu- signature ramen, a tonkotsu and miso broth with added spinach and garlicHokkaido Curry Ramen- rich curry-soy pork broth with crispy kara age chicken, nitamago, nori, menma, naruto fish cake, and spring onion",1
2,Really not that great. I was pretty disappointed in the overall experience. Ramen broth was ok but the meat wasn't seasoned well. Over crowded an bathroom smell was noticeable. This is tourist ramen.,-1
5,"The ramen here is delicious, nice filling portions and quick service if you are in a hurry. They also serve ""frozen beer"" where the froth is this strange frozen swirl if you are curious",1
4,"An absolute favorite Ramen restaurant of mine. This was the first time I'd been to the Carnaby Street branch, tucked away inside Kingly Court. From all the Shroyus it has the best atmosphere by far! It's not as crowded/ small as the others, the wood-paneled walls give it a warm feel and the lighting and decor is just right. 
The food of course is amazing. We shared the pimentos and the Chicken Karaage (a definite MUST at Shoryu), and for our mains I had the Curry Ramen- bursting with flavor and totally filling, while my friend, who likes her dishes a little more spicy, chose the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu.
Service was attentive and speedy, place was buzzing with people. You can't go wrong with this place to fulfill your Ramen Needs!",1
5,"Yes, it's as good as advertised. Line is not that long. And it's nice that they have a nice heat lamp for those waiting outside.",1
3,"Let me say that I'm a big ramen fan, but I think I've been spoiled by ramen I've had in San Francisco and Las Vegas.  
On a cold rainy day in London ramen is a nice antidote to blah weather.  This place does a decent job, although the noodles were pretty thin and didn't seem to be freshly made.  
Overall a decent place that I'd probably go back to.",-1
4,"Came here after seeing it on yelp. I was having a crazy ramen craving and this seemed like a legit spot, so I gave it a try. I'm sure glad I did!
I came at about 5 PM on a weekday and the place was about half full. I was immediately greeted by the waitstaff and seated at the tables facing the window (one of the perks of dining alone- you can people watch!). Its on Regent Street, smack dab in between Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square so there's plenty of foot traffic going by. 
The restaurant is somewhat small but has a very modern-style Japanese decor theme. The menu is short and sweet, but they have plenty of varieties of ramen for every taste. I originally leaned towards the curry ramen but ultimately went with the piri-piri ramen after reading peoples' rave reviews. 
I put in my order for a cocktail (only £6 during happy hour!) and ramen, and both were out within 10 minutes. My cocktail -whose name I cannot remember- tasted like a mai tai and was definitely strong... but enjoyable. The ramen came out piping hot with lots of goodies on top of the bed of noodles. The noodles were cooked to the perfect al-dente consistency but I was a little disappointed in the lack of spiciness. Since this is their spicy option, I expected a little more of a kick. There was also a little bit too much lemongrass for my own personal tastes but not so much that it kept me from enjoying my meal. I noticed some reviews remarked on the small serving size but I felt it was the perfect size. I hadn't eaten all day and finished off most of my noodles, and felt more than satisfied. 
Overall, this is a great ramen place if you're in central London. The service was super friendly and attentive. The ramen itself was really tasty and they have all kinds of varieties to try. I definitely think its worth checking out if you get the chance!",1
3,"As a ramen junkie from NYC, I've been traveling around London's ramen scene to try and find the best bowl here. Shoryu piqued my interest due to the fact that they tout their Hakata roots, which is the region of Japan that tonkotsu ramen is specialized. So I had to come by and try the tonkotsu broth!
I stopped in around noon and was seated immediately. I ordered the Kotteri Tonkotsu Ramen, a chashu pork bun, and a grilled halloumi and shimeji mushroom bun.
The ramen came out first, which was a bit strange, but I started eating. The broth was not as rich as I like my tonkotsu ramen to be. It has what I've complained about most NYC ramen - I call it the ""Ippudo Problem,"" where the tonkotsu broth is the specialty but is not super rich. Tonkotsu broth should be thick, bony, and hearty, but the broth here (which was said to be extra rich) is pretty thin. Also, it was a bit under seasoned, a bit bland. I don't like my broths salty but I do like some flavor in the soup.
The noodles here are missing that signature bite that ramen noodles have (even when I ordered it hard), almost just like regular egg noodles.
You can thank Momofuku and David Chang for the steamed buns with ramen trend around the world, and the buns here have the same problem that the ones at Momofuku Noodle Bar in NYC does - they are overly sauced with a very strong sauce that masks the flavor of the main ingredient and you basically are eating a bao with sauce and some meat/protein rather than getting a nice complex bite of flavors and textures. It's a shame, because I only really tasted the cucumber because it was not as salty as the rest of it. I actually had to wash it down with the broth (really shows you how bland it was).
I ordered kaedama and it came out quickly, but they didn't put any tare or sauce on the noodles, so when I put it into the bowl, it watered it down a bit and made it blander.
Overall, this was a pretty average bowl of ramen. There are many better bowls of ramen in London.",-1
4,"I'll go here again.  Small place but packed with lots of flavor and great Japanese ramen.  I got their set (shoryu bun, ramen, and cheesecake for 11.90) and Kirin Frozen. 
Great meal for dinner.",1
5,"I would give it six stars if I could. This place surpasses any ramen shop I visited in Boston or NewYork (yes, more impressive than Totto or Sapora etc.) I ordered the Tan Tan Ramen, whose soup base is AMAZING - with a touch of spiciness but not too heavy; make sure to choose to have noodle cooked the hardest way. My fiancé had another ramen (sry forgot the name lol) which was equally fantastic, and his soup base tastes totally different from mine - unlike a lot of other ramen places where dishes share similar base. Service is decent. We arrived ~9pm Sunday night and there was no queue.",1
5,"I like this Ramen place lot. Great service and great food. the Bun is so-so, I will only recommend the Ramen here. I will going back if I have a chance.",1
4,"I almost always try the most basic ramen when I visit a new place, but this time I made an exception and went for one of my favorites, cold sesame ramen (Hiyashi Chuka). If you've never had this before, and it's a hot summer day, you should definitely give it a chance. Save the hot soup for colder weather.
Noodles: Very good. Firm and cooked just right. Better than Bone Daddies IMO.
Hiyashi Chuka sauce/tare: A bit to much sweetness, but overall very good.
Tokyo egg: Perfectly cooked. However Bone Daddies tea smoked marinated egg is still one of the best I've ever had anywhere. 
Toppings: Menma (bamboo) not bad, needed  more crunch. Tomatoes were not the best - since they're in season now they could have been better. Charsu was a bit to dry, that's why most places use cooked ham typically (there  is no hot soup to soften the chasu). 
Nit picking now: Needed a small dab of mustard on the side (pretty standard). And cucumbers should be added too - especially since you're making it in England where they love cucumber too.
Overall: A great bowl. In Tokyo I'd give it a 3, but for London it's top notch.
Other stuff: Service was decent, but I find it really weird in London how so many servers don't seem to know squat about the food they're serving. Gyoza were good - and may have been made in house possibly (impressive).
I will return to try the basic tonkatsu ramen when the weather changes.",1
4,"Very tasty and mouthful. Stick with the raman, everything else is ordinary. Staff are pleasant ans the decor is nice.",1
3,"Ramen in london.  After visiting japan, the ramen was average.   Nothing bad about it although it it took an awful long time to arrive to the table.  The servers were really nice.   The price i felt was too high compared to other competitors.",-1
4,"Try to get here before 6pm if you are dining on a Saturday evening or you'll have to wait in line outside!
I too think their tonkotsu ramen is better than Bone Daddy's.  I had a bite of the ramen with matcha noodle, but I personally like the regular noodle better taste-wise, less distraction from the rest of the dish.  And matcha noodle seems to get soft quickly in hot soup while the regular noodle stayed firm for long.
I was very impressed with their salmon Hirata Buns.  The salmon karaage goes really with the soft bun with lettuce and cucumber, really enjoyed it :)
If you are looking for a Ume-shou type of salty tea, their Ume Kombu Cha is recommended.",1
2,"I don't want to sound like a food snob, but I wasn't expecting much from an English ramen place. However, I'm happy to say that Shoryu was a pleasant surprise! I saw a bunch of people waiting on line to get in but they were in parties of 3+ so I decided to go in and put myself on a list in case there was one. Turns out there is no list, the line is 'first come first served' but because I told them that I was just two people, we got to skip the line. Lesson: don't just follow the crowd. 
As per usual in London, it took a million years for them to take our order of a beer, cocktail, the tan tan ramen and the Dracula ramen. The cocktail, which was just soda and plum wine, wasn't very good. But, the ramens weren't all that bad. The minced pork ramen (£10) was pretty much liquid fire for me, but my boyfriend managed fine. The Dracula ramen (£11.90) had a richer broth that wasn't spicy and was really good when I added some rice vinegar to it. Good spot if you're looking for a change from the fish and chips, but I don't need to go back.",-1
4,"My next favorite place for ramen in London, 2nd to kanada-ya. The ramen is great, and the side dishes are also delicious. Only downside is that the ramen sometimes feels abit greasy imo. Btw, the curry ramen is really good actually but it's not a popular choice so I'm recommending it here.",1
4,"I found Shoryu Ramen to be much better than bone daddies!  However, I never found bone daddies to be traditional style ramen in the first place...
We arrived Sunday afternoon and we were seated immediately.  I got their classic Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu and the wife got the Piri Piri Tonkotsu which is their spiciest ramen.  Both looked great and tasted even better!
They even give you the option for 4 different sizes noodles, however, we stuck with the classic thin hosomen noodles (original) ...not sure if they were homemade but they tasted very good.
Am looking forward to going back to try some of their more creative ramen like the 'Dracula Tonkotsu'?!",1
4,"This place definitely hit the spot on a rainy and cold day in London! My friend and I were lucky to make it to the shop before the kitchen closes (they close 30 min before their posted closing time). We didn't have that much time left to order but we were definitely satisfied with what we got!
We both ordered the Piri Piri Shoryu Ramen, it's the spicy version of the Shoryu Ramen. We both loved our ramen! The noodles tasted very fresh and the broth was very flavorful and had the right amount of spice! I wouldn't recommend getting the Piri Piri if you are just looking for a little bit of heat. The green tea and raspberry mochi were the perfect treat to end our dinner.
I forgot to mention that service was really friendly too. 
I've had good ramen back in the a States before and I think this place is very good. The only downside about it is that everything is so expensive in London. Back in the States, you can get a lot of extra toppings and customize your own ramen for much cheaper at very well known ramen shops. However, it is what it is and I definitely enjoyed Shoryu Ramen! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! :)",1
3,"Had the kotteri tonkotsu ramen and a beer. 
Noodles were decent, roasted pork a bit small, boiled egg was good. Soup tasted like it had noodle flour in it and also the kitchen had dumped a massive pile of pickled ginger on top which made the soup taste oddly fishy. 
The draft beer was Kirin, decent but not spectacular- on the menu it said that it would be served very cold but it was several degrees above that. 
Price for a bowl of ramen 12 quid, with today's exchange rate making the ramen at least 3 times what one would pay for the same food in Japan. Service was friendly if a bit disorganized on a crowded Saturday afternoon, but the buy 1 ramen get the second half-off coupon that I used made up for any slowness and probably saved Shoryu from a trip to 2-starland, for now three is the number of the stars thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three.",-1
3,"Was not happy with the service.  The lady did not comprehend what I was asking. I ordered the regular ramen w the fried shallots and I had asked her if it was simply the basic ramen w the Pork and egg plus the added ingredient of fried shallots. Took me about Three minutes to ask what I needed to ask until I gave up and went with it. And she still didn't understand. Service was terrible overall 
The ramen was ok. A bit oily. I prefer kanada-ya ramen over shoryu",-1
4,"Great place last minute when a more popular ramen place had a line out the door.
Service was a bit slow but they were just finishing up their night so it is to be expected when closing up other areas of the shop. 
Will def return.",1
5,"My wife and I loved this place.  There was a short wait to get a table as the place was packed but certainly worth the wait.  The broth was savory, the noodles were cooked perfectly, and the portion was just the right size.  I don't really associate London with ramen but my wife and I will certainly be back!",1
5,"Shoryu think you can cook Ramen! Honestly this restaurant was AMAZING. Great service that was friendly and quick and the best food I've had in awhile. I highly recommend the pork belly bun, edamame beans, and ramen! I would go again!",1
4,Visiting London and was trying to find a delicious Ramen place. Checked out Yelp and this was the top rated one nearby our hotel. I see how it was top rated. The service was very attentive and quick. The Ramen man it was delish the broth was super tasty. I ordered the spicy mince pork one while my bf ordered the most popular ramen dish. I prefered my broth for it was less richer. Overall if ever back in London would definitely come back!,1
5,"Now I see what all the hype is surrounding Ramen.  With a sore throat and the desire for some fresh vegetables, we happily chose to eat here for some ramen. 
I ordered the vegetarian bowl with extra mushrooms and my friend ordered the traditional pork Ramen bowl. 
Although it took some getting use to using the spoon and chopsticks, we really enjoyed our fresh soup and I'm wishing there was a great ramen place in Tampa bay.",1
5,"I've been to a lot of ramen places in the US (mostly in California), but Shoryu Ramen in London is hands down the best I've had. We were in town for less than a week, and naturally we wanted to try out as many restaurants as possible, but we ended up eating here twice because it was so good.
The wait was quite long for dinner, but we were able to be seated immediately for lunch. It's a small, packed space and you will most likely be seated at a table connected to another party.
I got the curry ramen both times. It was unique, flavorful, and the perfect portion. The only suggestion I have is to put the karaage chicken on the side, so as not to have them turn soggy.  Additionally, the lychee strawberry drink was amazing, but maybe not worth £6.",1
5,"Delicious! 
I went to London for a weekend and I absolutely wanted to try Shoryu after all the excellent reviews I read. 
I waited for 30 min on a cold night but it was definitely worth the wait. 
I ordered a Karaka Tantan Tonkotsu ramen and loved it ! The noodles were perfectly cooked and broth was yummy & spicy.",1
5,very nice. we got two spicy vegans and one tonkatsu. the aesthetic and atmosphere itself is very cozy. service is prompt and answer all and any questions you have. food is delicous and huge-as ramen always is. and it's open late!,1
4,"The Donkatsu ramen was very good.  Rich and brothy.  Much better than what I tasted in Paris.  However, not as good as in SF or Japan but well worth the 1.5 miles walk from my hotel.  Also had the tempura and sesame tofu.  The tempura was good but not too much batter.  Not as crunchy as it could have been.  The black sesame toy was new and good.  I would definitely come back!",1
4,"It's very hard for me to go and change a venue for something new especially when it comes to Ramen. Although this was a good choice. Food was very tasty. Service was cool too. I will definitely come back when I am back in London. 
Thanks",1
5,"Quite disappointed with the pork belly bun, the pork was great but while the bun looked well made, it seemed to have been ""restored"" in the microwave. Even with a full set of teeth there was no tearing through that bun. 
   But alas, then the ramen arrived, I had the Karaha Tantan Tonkosu Ramen.  I was totally blown away. I was just in Tokyo in January and this bowl rivaled my favorites there. Perfect texture and wonderful warming heat! I could not get this dish out of my mind and returned to their other Soho location two days later! Even with the bulletproof bun, I am still giving 5 stars!",1
4,"Really good ramen! Okra appetizer looks deceptively simple but really yummy.  The broth is less pork-y, if you know what I mean.  This really hits the spot when you're looking for ramen and thankfully now there are a few locations so less chance that you'll have to queue.
I would have given five stars but it's a little while since I've been so I'm going to have to visit again and update my review.  A good excuse to have ramen at Shoryu again!",1
4,"Yum yum yum!
Was looking for authentic Japanese ramen and definitely found it here! Even my parents approved/they loved it!
Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu: Perfect ramen if you're looking for a savory hearty ramen. 
Hirata Buns: ****OH MY GOODNESS. Must try. delicious.
Chicken Kara Age: Can never go wrong with fried chicken :)
It gets pretty busy so I'll definitely be back on a slow day/night.",1
4,The shoryu ban with pork and chicken is very delicious. The Piri Piri Tonkotsu is kind of spicy but it tastes good.,1
2,"Not that good as I had too much good experience in HK. The food did not meet my expectation. The pork belly bun is too fatty for me and the steamed bun is not that soft, the sauce is not strong. The dumpling is nothing special. Will not go again 
But the staff is very helpful there",-1
5,"I can't believe it has taken me so long to write this review.
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!
I remember the first time I discovered this place: I was on bus 23 towards Picadilly Circus when I saw the huge line of Japanese outside this little place. Intrigued, I went back the next day, stood in line in the cold for half an hour having no idea what was expecting me. Basically, I didn't know what ramen was until I stepped foot here.
Obviously, I've seen the light and consider myself a convert. My new religion is ramen. 
Ramen is a bowl of soup, mostly on pork stock, with noodles, half an egg, some veggies - but the description doesn't do it justice, as ramen is a state of mind. The absolutely sensational feeling of well being when you sip on the soup, chew on the noodles. Then the wonderful feeling hours after you've had your ramen.. Ahh.. 
I usually go for the Tokyo Ramen, but last time Ulrik tried the cold ramen and it was soooo good! A new favourite for sure.
Go, wait in line, eat, be happy!",1
4,"Great ramen place, though not the most authentic (pickled ginger strips, what are you doing in my ramen soup??) and a bit pricey. Close to Piccadilly Circus. Make sure to go early if you have a large party, especially for dinner because this place fills up fast.",1
4,"After going to Japan recently, my husband and I are now massive ramen snobs.  We've been to Shoryu in Soho before and loved it, so we gave this one a try on a Sunday night (no booking) to see if it was as good as we remembered.
It's a packed and busy place, with no room to wait inside, but it was only about 10 minutes before we made it in the door with my parents and grandmother.  I had the Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu - their signature ramen with meatier broth and two eggs, as well as barbecued pork belly, mushrooms, spring onion, sesame, ginger, and seaweed.  Drool.  You can choose how firm you want the noodles too (firm all the way!) and we passed around a few sides of lovely Chicken Karaage - Japanese fried chicken.  It was, as expected, lush, although not the completely glorious closed-eyes experience I remembered from the other Shoryu (I think Japan has ruined me forever).  The broth is just lacking that particular je ne sais quoi that we ate in Asia, but everything else about the dish - noodles, pork, accoutrements, were lovely and craveable.  The fried chicken was very good, with a more delicate batter than you usually get with fried chicken, no bones, and a very hot temperature so watch your tongue!
A very affordable and delicious place to go for dinner.  Not a bad substitute if you can't make it to Tokyo!",1
3,"The pork belly buns were flavourfull and yummy; the gyoza had a fresh pork filling that reminded me of homemade (although the skins were not).  I had the original ramen which was a big bowl of miso pork broth with two fatty slices of pork, some seaweed and scallions.  This was good although I did have food envy for my friend's signature ramen (there was half an egg!)  One drawback on the broth was that it was quite greasy.  Defat the broth!  It's not hard to do and really makes for a better, non-greasy experience.  It's not fun having to wipe your lips because it feels like you've put on too much lip balm.
While I liked Shoryu and would go back, the main drawback is the seating.  I think they are trying to provide an authentic, Tokyo experience by making the tables as crowded together as possible.  It is not a place to have any sort of intimate conversation with anyone because you are literally right up against the person sitting next to you.  I get turning tables but Shoryu borders on the ridiculous.  No wonder there were so many solo diners.  You wouldn't want to go here for a friendly chat or first date!",-1
3,Ramen and buns are okay. Service was prompt. The price is reasonable compared to london standards. They add a service charge to your bill. Come here early as the place gets packed after 6pm.,-1
4,"I had their signature ramen dish. It's ok but I've had better. Broth was a bit bland for my taste, noodles were decent but could be better. Pork was very good. I'd eat here again if I was in the area but wouldn't come specially for this.",1
4,"I've now had the chance to return to Shoryu to try more of their menu. In fact, their ever burgeoning menu. I'm impressed quickly they've added dishes to their menu, both in the ramen and the starter/side dishes categories
They've also tweaked service slightly. You still get the cheerful Japanese greeting but they've done away with the drum they hit with each new customer
They've expanded their ramen menu with both traditional and innovative combinations. I want to love their ramen but can only bring myself to like it. At the risk of sounding ungrateful, I think they put too much in their bowl. I like ramen because I like to taste the ramen noodles but the noodles get lost with all the other parapernalia they put into the bowl
They've also greatly expanded their starter/side dish menu. I have to give a shout out to their belly pork hirata buns. These are made up with 2 steamed buns which are quite dense but the perfect foil to the sweet soft pork which they sandwich. I had discovered these at Ippudo in New York and am so glad that I've found somewhere in London which does them
If you want a range of dishes, go to Shoryu for their range. However, if you want the best bowl ramen, I'd still recommend Bone Daddies",1
4,"Delicious and fresh of the salmon 
I recommend the spicy reman.
My friend and I love this place. 
The service here is great. The waiters are friendly
When you pay the bill,it contain the tip ,10% of the cost.",1
4,"Me and some friends took advantage of the massive discounts Shoryu was offering and payed the new shop in Piccadilly a visit.   I gotta say in advance that my opinion about the place was not very positive for a good part of the evening but then built up and ended on a good note.  
When we first arrived, we were left outside on a queue waiting to get in with no indication of whether it would take 10 minutes or 1 hour. Not a big deal, but doesn't get anyone any points either. When we finally got a table, we had to wait quite a while to get a menu (which only arrived after us chasing the waiter). 10 minutes later, 2 more people were squeezed in into our table - clearly a management attempt to fit in as many people as possible.  It is fair to say that there wasn't much space left in the table, but that didn't matter as far as the drinks were concerned: 3£ for the smallest orange juice I've ever seen in my life.  
Those were the not so good points... but then a storm of flavor arrived and washed that all away.  
The starters are really really good, specially the Hirata Buns - the pork ones are spicy but terrific. We also had Soft Shell Crab Tempura which were more than enough for 4 people.  
The main Ramen dishes completely met our expectations: flavorful, big portions, good balance between the ingredients. We struggled to finish them after all those starters so it's worth building up your appetite before visiting the place! I had the Tori Kara-Age Men and was quite happy with it - only negative was the size of the fish cake portion: way too small.   We also ordered an extra cold Ramen to try it out. Unfortunately, the waiter brought us the wrong one, so not sure which one it was. 
Overall the service was a bit all over the place and not that well organized, but the staff was friendly and approachable. Can't really give this one a 5 but the food was good enough to stir away from a 3.",1
4,"3.5 stars
Decent ramen in London??? Not sure I even recognise this city anymore. I swear every place has only popped up in the year I was away. (Which is incredible!)
Ramen:
Any place with tonkotsu broth, I'm going to invariably compare to ippudo. The broth was good to be sure but just not as flavourful as I'd like. It lacks a certain intensity you find in other places.
Noodles here are pretty nice. Again, not big on flavour but they have a wonderful texture. Definitely Shoryu's USP.
Sides:
Had gyozas, chicken karaage, and pork buns. All were extremely enjoyable. Pork buns are a must order. 
Overall:
I'd give the ramen 3.5 stars objectively. In Singapore or New York, I'd say this is an average ramen place. It's a safe choice, enjoyable, but really nothing special. In London though, those same factors mean it's effectively 5 stars. If you're craving ramen, you'll be satisfied.",1
4,"I queued in the snow for nearly an hour... just to eat this ramen.
(And gyoza and onigiri)
AND IT RULED.
After we finally got in, we got lucky and secured the only 2 seater table in the place. We were right against the window and had to turn our knees outward as they didn't fit under the table, and I had a fire extinguisher sticking out from the wall behind me. It's definitely a squash in here when it's full so be warned. But unlike Bone Daddies your lack of space doesn't come with uncomfortably loud music and petty portion sizes. So it's even more worth it.
We ordered some drinks and a portion of gyoza. They came pretty quickly and were awesome. The gyoza skins were nicely crispy and the perfect thickness.
Then our ramens arrived. I had the Charsui Tonkotsu for £10 a bowl - which is kind of expensive, but the portion is really generous and it's so good - again this beat Bone Daddies offering. There was lots of broth (GOOD) and the perfect amount of noodles and meat and lots of toppings. The broth was the perfect texture, it had that tonkotsu thickness but wasn't too fatty and greasy. My husband went for the Dracula Tonkotsu, which he loved. It was essentially the richer, garlicy-er version of the normal Tonkotsu and was a dream come true. We asked for vinegar and shichimi powder. They brought a huge metal jug of vinegar and a cute wooden container of shichimi, the waiter was quite funny about the size of the vinegar and the vinegar was really, really good. I love vinegar in my ramen so finding a place that offers it on-menu is a huge plus.
When we saw the specials board we couldn't help ordering a couple of onigiri. They were meant to come with brown rice but as they were running out they asked if we'd mind one with white rice. They were so apologetic and said if we didn't like it with white rice we could have one with brown for free! But for me this was even better as I prefer white rice. They were filled with pickles and really delicious.
The onigiri filled us up quite a lot and when we couldn't finish the ramen, we were so happy to find they'd bag everything up in a takeaway bag for us to take home.
The service was good, with one minor slip up when a different waiter tried to deliver a second plate of dumplings to us and didn't apologise for the mistake, aside from that it was pretty perfect.
I love the food here. If it wasn't for the cramped space (sorry, I know it's ramen bar style but I'm still getting used to these packed-in restaurants!) and the fact we had to queue for so long it'd be a 5 star straight away!",1
3,Great value for money in London- very enjoyable food - company and service- sure there is better about but this is a great sushi - Japanese Restrauant in a nice quite location- you will enjoy it without fuss- walked in freestyle for a Restrauant and found this gem. Was very close t giving it a 4 star rating - but is just isn't there yet,-1
4,"So yummy. Much Umami. Goooood!
Quick lunch in trafalgar square and around? planning for some ramen but you already tried sasuke (which is better!)? Definitely come here. Especially if you are alone.
The place is not that big with many small tables and a counter running all over the window. No-nonsense chart, solid ramens, some buns and just a couple of other dishes. But you definitely wanna get the ramen.
Take the one you prefer, I usually go for the standard one when I want to try a new place (first you show me you can cook a steak, then you can make a filetto alla rossini!), and just stare at the broth: Brown, thick, if I didn't knew it was liquid I'd have said it was a cream! Definitely something special, you can feel that it will be delicious just by looking at it! That my friends is probably the best broth I ever had in my ramen. The egg follows the same description, just absolutely amazing, cooked at the perfection, and overall a real pleasure.
The only thing missing, and the reason why it stands below Sasuke in my personal RAMENED competition (Ramen Axelrod May Eat Night & Day) is regarding the thickness of the noodles, which I found a bit too thin for my personal palate. But that's just me being an annoying stickler.
Just come here and enjoy the delicious broth!",1
4,"I tried the Karaka TanTan Tonkotsu Ramen which were garlicky spicy noodles with minced pork on top.  My egg was a bit overcooked, I do like the yolk soft and runny.  My Tantan noodles were on the saltier side.  The only thing that annoyed me was that all the minced pork sunk to the bottom of the bowl, and I spent most of my time trying to fish it out. 
I think I'm gonna stick with basic Tonkotsu noodles, where I actually get slices of pork.  
To share, we had the Chicken Karaage - same as last time, nicely fried!  We also ordered Gyoza, but for 5, I felt it was quite understuffed and small.  The wrapping was a bit on the hard side.  The pork filling was good, nothing wrong with that.  But I think for the value, I'll stick with just the karaage. 
My friend ordered the Charsiu Tonkotsu - which is pretty much your classic noodles but with extra pork.  I tasted the broth, and strangely enough, it was... on the sweeter side.  I thought it was just me, but he tasted it too and thought it was definitely sweet.  Anyway, still a nice place to go to, but I think my go-to place is Bone Daddies for now.",1
5,This place is amazing.  Original and vegetarian were both delicious.  I've been dreaming about the broth and the noodles ever since.  Very warming on a cold winter night.,1
5,"I got a very good Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu. The broth was very tasty and there was quite a lot of meat and vegetables inside.
The only problem is that the standard noodles are very thin. If you prefer the bigger noodles you must tell it when you order.
Every day they also have a day offer: when I went there it was 2 buns at the price of 1. Which is a pretty good offer since it means that you'll pay just 2.25£ per each.",1
4,"I only had one vegetarian choice here...and I loved it! I also had the sake flight of the day and it was a great discovery. The non-Japanese staff kept yelling random-sounding phrases in Japanese. Not too sure what that means but whatever! It's a small place so be ready to wait, it's worth it.",1
2,"This is a solid 3 stars, if you only order the ramen. The buns were a huge disappointment, lovely soft and fluffy, ruined by iceberg lettuce, piece of cucumber and pretty rank Mayo. Not worth queuing for, pricey, but I can forgive a little of that given it is in tourist central. Broth is made centrally and shipped in, if that matters to you. I feel kind of bad about the two stars, but don't big up the buns and leave me feeling like I've been conned out of seven and a half quid ! Will I be back, probably not.",-1
4,"Really solid ramen chain. Go for the Dracula garlic flavor or something more than just the plain option. We tried the third ""hardest"" noodle type and it was good, nothing too crazy. I'd try the hardest one next time. The noodles are thin and not too starchy, so the consistency worked well. The garlic broth was intense in a great way. I do wish they included corn as a topping. My husband ordered a ""frozen beer"" which was a fun gimmick. 
The place should write down orders though because they initially brought us the entirely wrong flavor for one of our bowls and had to go remake it. Then they just never delivered the appetizer we ordered. Kinda amateur service issues.",1
5,"I only was told about this ramen place two weeks ago while trying out another Ramen bar ... since then I have been three time. Yes, it is that good. I like most of the broths, also some were too salty. I also tried the different sides and they are all delicious. I'm a fan. ... but I think I will stop going now, as I need to give other places a try as well.
One word of warning: on the weekend we had to queue for a place, but on a normal weekday ... if you go straight after work ... you will find a spare seat.",1
4,"I've been to Shoryu now twice, once during their soft opening and once afterwards. 
This place specializes in a a different sort of white soup ramen from a particular region in Japan. Compared to places like Bone Daddies, this is more of an authentic Japanese-style ramen place (but that's not to say that authenticity=better). 
Service: When I went during the soft opening, they were definitely still working out the kinks. They have one waitress in particular who we've named 'waitress happy pants' because of her... rather surly demeanor. Quite frankly, I don't know if she was just having a horrible day or what, but I am very forgiving when it comes to bad service, but less so when they are snappy and eye-rolly and seem like they hate their job and everything is the customer's fault (even when it isn't). At any rate, she was actually more hilarious than frustrating, so whatever. 
Food: High soup to noodle content, the soup is flavorful but not quite rich enough for my personal tastes, some nice goodies in the bowl, but not quite enough of them. The ramen noodles themselves were the best thing about this bowl, really good. The first time I got the Shoryu Ramen, which was nice. The second time I had the Tokyo Ramen, which was soy sauce based broth with fish cake and bamboo. I think I prefer the Shoryu because it was one of the specialty white broths. Do order the egg, as they are well seasoned and quite nice (though it is a shame they don't come automatically with a bowl like they do at Tonkotsu and Bone Daddies). My dining partner had the yuzu ramen, which was really tasty. 
When I come back, I want to try to spicy miso and the yuzu ones. That said, and this is just personal preference, I found the overall dining experience and food at Bone Daddies to be more satisfying, but it is actually quite hard to compare the two as they are totally different ramen beasts. I'll certainly be back to Shoryu as well, when I want a soupier/less heavy noodle experience.",1
4,"To be honest, one of the best meals we had in London. Despite the poor service (bad attitude) the food was very good. The soup was thick and the noodles was perfect too. Great reman!",1
4,"Went today to take advantage of their soft launch special where ramen is all 50% off. The place was packed!! I've never seen so many Japanese people in one place in London :P
I had the spicy miso ramen which was awesome. Broth and noodles were legit. Loved it and you can't beat the price at 4 quid for the special price. Service was fast and friendly.  
Soft launch special prices are until Nov 24.",1
5,"Best ramen I have ever had! I ordered the kimchi seafood ramen ! Spicy with fresh squid, scallops and  prawns!",1
4,"Authentic and Nice atmosphere. Friendly service :)
Had the signature dish ( tonkotsu ramen) and hirata bun as side. Great value, and large portions!",1
5,"Best ramen I've had!! Visiting from the US and I will have serious cravings for this place later. Cute little restaurant and friendly staff. The broth they use is seriously amazing! I got the standard ramen bowl they had with the fried shallots, no nori (just cause I'm not a fan of seaweed), and it was seriously so delicious! Would definitely recommend!",1
3,"Tried the Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu and though it was alright. The broth has flavor, but felt like it was watery. I am comparing it to the ramen I had in California which was pretty flavorful. The ramen noodle itself wasn't anything to right about.
However, I also tried their Shoryu buns and I would recommend it to anyone who goes there. The meat is pretty tender and flavorful. 
Having only been there once, I would give this place another try. Maybe the chef was having a bad day.",-1
3,"Winter ramen.  Soup is good, prices anywhere from 10 to 20 pounds. Not so busy, so service alright.  No cockroaches on my food.  I'm not crazy about ramen but enjoy them from time to time.",-1
3,"Overall a good meal.  But the whitebait just wasn't good.
The wagyu buns were large and fluffy compared to others, but were filled with tasty beef and melted in your mouth.  
The Piri piri Tonkotsu ramen was good.  Lots of flavor with a beautiful egg and a nice kick.  
The gyoza was nicely done with a crunchy lace in the bottom of the skillet.
The whitebait was fishy though.  Didn't taste very fresh.  Didn't finish these.",-1
4,"Pretty good ramen by London standards, can be a little salty, but if you're in the area, is always a good choice for a bite of Japanese. Take note that queues can be long, so be prepared for a wait. I tried the black garlic ramen, which was unique and left me warm and happy. The space can be a little cramped due to the huge number of people they have, so the point is - eat fast and get the hell out of there, and reflect on how tasty it was after you leave. Worth a try for sure.",1
4,"If you like spicy food, don't listen to the waitress warnings. Specialty cocktails were good but the ramen stole the show",1
4,"I enjoyed my Shoryu Tonkatsu ramen but personally I prefer the Bone Daddie Tonkatsu ramen more. I found the ramen here to be very good, with generous serving portion, more toppings and equally satisfying, however, I still pick BD tonkatsu over it. My reasoning behind it is that I felt that the broths (both pork and chicken) there were much tastier and with more intense flavour.
As for the service here, my experience with Shoryu was as good as our service in BD. I had no complaints. Overall, Shoryu was good but my taste buds seek the BD flavour.",1
3,"This ramen is clearly geared towards the western palate.  If you're looking for authentic Japanese ramen, this isn't really it.  It is still good though.  
We did have an unfortunate thing happen when we went; my friend's phone was stolen while we were eating there.  Keep an eye on your things while you're there!",-1
4,"Very good ramen place. 
We had the spicy ramen (#4) and normal (#1). Topped off with frozen Kirin (draft beer topped with frozen foam made from beer -- so it keeps it colder longer without diluting the beer when it melts). 
I added fresh pressed garlic (sorry to my darling wife). 
Although the ramen was very tasty, the presentation isn't to be overlooked. From the bowl and wooden ladle to the layout of the ingredients on top (half an egg, thin slices of pork, chopped onions, etc). 
Perfect after freezing our fingers and toes off for an hour+ watching the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace.",1
5,This place has the best buns I've ever tasted and Monday 2-4-1 is a steal. The ramen is top too. If you're in town you just visit,1
3,"The ramen was wonderful. Ordered a signature ramen. Besides the ramen, I ordered a pork bun too. However, it came out a little disappointing, as the bun is cut into halves instead of folded, like how it was supposed to be. There was also some mayonnaise used in the pork bun, which to me, was a bad idea to a cuisine like this. When it was served, the bun was a little cold, indicating that it was not freshly steamed. On the other hand, the broth to the ramen was just nice! Perfect! And I like how we get to choose the tenderness of the noodle. Overall, the ramen is good, and the ambience is perfect since the server tries to use Japanese but I would avoid the pork bun.",-1
4,"This is just a review of the veggie ramen - I've heard excellent things about the non-veg but haven't tried it.
The veggie ramen is wholesome and satisfying - exactly what you want on a cold day. It's a little bit bland, which is why I recommend getting it with the chilli sauce, but with that addition it's delicious.",1
1,"A comedy of bad service. Don't buy the wine. They served probably the worst expensive Chablis I have ever had. They also failed to have almost any of the gluten free items on the menu. 
Finally they did not deliver one main. It was my main and I can't review the food because after a long wait I didn't eat. 
Dead loss.",-1
4,"Surprisingly, I enjoyed their ramen much more than the ones I've had back home in Las Vegas. The broth, noodles, and toppings...delicious from the beginning to the end. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is their price. £11 or around $17 for a bowl of ramen when I'm used to paying $7 in Vegas.",1
5,Excellent service from start to finish -fantastic Ramen and to top it off a frosty draft beer...couldn't of asked for better! whenever I'm in London I will be back.,1
5,"Very good place! We got the prawn tempura and it was great! And we got the mushroom appetizer and it was good too! The ramen was also very nice- the broth was not as rice as my ramen place in santa clara buutt it was good. I thought it was a little weird that they didnt have corn as an option to add to the ramen but oh well.. come for the music, stay for the ramen!",1
3,"We were extremely impressed with the Tonketsu ramen.We added some Japanese chili powder to our noodle.Wow.we thought the Ramen scene in London has come of age.
Then the MSG induced dry mouth came.OH OH.
Tonketsu with MSG!!!!!!",-1
4,"Good Ramen, and the buns are great too
Gyoza was amazing, didn't think gyoza can be that good",1
4,"It's a chain restaurant that can be found mostly in central London. The ramen here is consistently good. The bao, though, not so much - a tad bit too pricey for the lacklustre flavour and ingredients in the bao itself. Stick with the ramen, and go for the dessert after if you're still hungry (warning: you'll probably be ultra full after their generous servings of ramen!).",1
3,"Well.. was ok, I guess. In theory Ramen are just a fast food, but nvertheless it's quite difficult to get it right. This place is a quite a gimmick: A blonde greets you at the door with a forced and awkward ""irah..shai..ma..sei?"", hits an embarrassing Japanese drum, and shows you to your table.. the broth is quite boring.. neither memorable, nor worth writing much more about.. ok overall. 
(oh, on the way out they hit the drum again.. I have probably eaten at 500 different restaurants in Japan, and never seen this before)",-1
4,Good ramen. I had the dracula ramen (with lots of garlic). Really good for a cold night.,1
4,"Delicious broth, especially On a grey, drizzly day. The noodle texture is not my fave- too thin, but overall a delicious bowl of ramen. Wonderful service- very friendly and attentive",1
3,"Nice food, good costumer service. The ramen was well served, well condiment. The spice plate was hot but not excessive",-1
3,"Will this Ramen blow your mind... not quite. 
Shoryu, either this one, or the one on the other side of Picadilly Circus, is nice for a quick stop. It's always busy -  in my option this may have more to do with the lack of alternative choices in the area vs. the quality of the food.. 
I've not found better contenders in London, but compared to other cities, the ramen leaves something to be desired. 
Avoid the green tea mochi! 4.50 for one small piece that we didn't finish because it tasted bad :/",-1
5,"One of the best ramens I've tasted outside of Japan. Great selections and the broth is divine. Very friendly, quick staff. There are sharing tables so if you come alone or even with just a few friends, you may be sharing a big table. I went by myself and sat next to an interesting group. I haven't tried the sushi here, but when the ramen is so good, you don't really need not. Price is pretty decent.",1
3,"Solid flavor, but not enough noodles. (I got thick; those with thin noodles seemed to have larger portions). I also ordered a beer that didn't come until I was halfway through my meal and water that never came. Really expensive, but that's probably because I'm an American who isn't used to the pound.",-1
3,"31/3/14
Okay.......... Was thinking to change this to 4 stars or not after finish eating my bowl of noodle while waiting for my add on side order hakata roll to come.
Reason to add a star:
1. Ramen still as yummy. I ordered hakata tantan ramen. Nice n spicy. Still loving their chicken kara age.
2. They change their table n chair to proper table!!
Reason on holding back:
1. Table was quite oily and sticky. the stuff that I taking up from the table keep sticking on table which make me think about the hygiene of this consider still new ramen shop.
2. Our sushi didn't come after 20min...... Ask for a waiter to check if they did place the order if they didn't then is ok we ready to pay. He went to check n come back telling us ok Cancelled now!! -_-!!
Okay....... 
2013
Have been looking for an authentic japanese ramen shop for quite some time. Heard bout this restaurant for quite some time and finally we get to try it.
When there around 8pm on a weekday with my friend. No queue. Got seated once we were there. Their table and chair seems to be slightly lower. The chair is like those low bar chair kind.......Not comfortable type. Clearly they do not want their customer to be too comfortable and stay too long in their restaurant.
The day we went we they were giving out free sake for customer. I ordered their house special bone soup roast pork ramen (I think it call tongkotsu). It was yummy. I like it.  We also order 2 sides fried chicken and the green bean edamame. They serve the bean with brown colour rock salt which make it look special. They do give a free side which is vinegar cabbage.
Would give a 4 stars if they have more spacious space and comfy seating for  what the price they are charging their customer.",-1
2,Very bad ramen. Very disapointing. The burger was beautifuk but it felt like eating a small burger at mcdonald. Pretty fade taste. wouldnt come back unless  it is for a quick lunch and there is nothing else open...,-1
5,"This has to be one of the best ramen that I've tasted in London.  I actually took a friend here that lived in Japan for 3 years and they gave it their stamp of approval, being the best ramen that they'd tasted outside of Japan and that it was very authentic.
The portions are a good size and you can ask for an extra serving of noodles if needed.  I've never needed to have extra noodles as the portions are pretty filling and the prices are reasonable for what you get.",1
4,"This lovely Japanese style place is perfect for a dinner for two or more. The ramen is very tasty and the portion is very big. We also took a ""bun"", something like a steamed bread sandwich stuffed with fried chicken, lettuce and two different sauces. The staff is very friendly and able to give you a lot of tips about the dishes. I'll be back soon.",1
4,"Love this place! Ordered their ramen special with pork belly, and steamed bbq pork buns. Absolutely DELISH, and made to feel very welcome!",1
4,"I had the best ramen experience in London. Small cozy place with nice friendly atmosphere. I ordered hirata bun with pork (which is absolutely amazing, must try) and spicy noodle (which was absolutely amazing as well). Highly recommended",1
5,"Best ramen I've had in London. It gets busy though, so be prepared to queue. The steam buns are ok, but not the best I've had. My friend was disappointed they took off the salmon buns from the menu. She loved them.",1
4,"This place is always busy and I definitely wasn't dissapointed once I had jostled for the last reminaing seat!
I had the natural tonkotsu and my boyfriend had the iced chicken wings and pork buns, which he loved.
The dumplings were a little on the dry side unfortunately but everything else was great.",1
3,"Not bad for local standard, but lacks authenticity.  Soup base should be richer, the noodle is a bit too soggy for ramen gurus.",-1
5,"Got to finally try this place out. Waited around 10mins to be seated during the lunch time hours. Ordered the Shoryu Ramen, and have to say I was impressed. Very good flavor broth and the veg was very good and the meat was cooked spot on. I pretty much gobbled up all of it and the egg was cooked perfectly. Obviously not as amazing as the Ramen I have in Los Angeles, but for London I was very happy with it. Definitely recommend this place for anyone craving Ramen around London.",1
5,"Perfect place to be when its cold and wet outside. Ended up getting a spicy ramen which was incredible. Broth wasn't overpowered by the spice. We also got some bao/buns to share. Chicken came with an amazing sauce, the pork was maybe a little too fatty for my liking. (Visit - 27/05/2014 Dinner)",1
5,"Easily my favorite meal I've had in London. I thought about going back and definitely would have, but I wanted to try other places. I had to Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu which was fantastic.",1
4,Excellent ramen. The gyoza (potsticker) is very good as well. Service exceeds expectation for a lunch spot. We would return.,1
5,lovely place. the waitress explains all the different types of ramen soup. the kotteri Hakkatan tonkotsu is to die for,1
4,"There are queues everywhere in London, but this one wasn't so bad when we arrived around 5:30pm on a Saturday (10 mins wait), and definitely worth it! This was my first real ramen house experience, so I got the tonkotsu regular - it was flavorful with an egg, veggies but only about three slices of pork. I had a taste of the spicy tonkotsu broth, and it's a little more flavorful only if you can handle the heat!! We also didn't have to wait very long for the soup to come, which was convenient. The ambiance is charming and modern, and the servers were attentive, but since this restaurant is quite small and pretty busy, we decided against overstaying our welcome. Recommended if you're near Piccadilly Circus.",1
3,"This place is in the heart of the shopping district in London. After walking around in the cold throughout the day, my gf and I wanted something warm and came across this place. The service and location are exceptional, albeit a very touristy location. Obviously, I gravitated towards this location because all tourists get sucked into the ""tourist epicenter"" of any city. The food is good but not great (meat quality in the buns is not good) and definitely not worth the price. I understand rent is very expensive in this area and the high costs definitely pass down to the food. However, I was still disappointed with the quality of food based on the price. After paying for the meal, I thought about selling my semen to a sperm bank to help offset the cost of this meal. I eventually decided not to do it because I didn't want my biological kids trying to find me 30 years later during their ""finding myself stage"" to figure out what genetic similarities we shared. At the end of the day, I thought about semen for money for ramen. End of story. End of review. I didn't do it. I'm out.",-1
5,"I give this 5 stars because it was just amazing. The menu had so many options and was super nutritious (even had multiple gluten-free options!) I tried the Hirata Bun first which was a rice bun with pork, lettuce, and an amazing sauce. The bun was so soft and the pork was really great. The service for the food was perfect, nice and fast. The standard origin Ramen I got after the Hirata bun was delicious!",1
4,"Yummy! One star off because there was no healthy options. We got a bottle of rose and the buns with chicken karaage (deep fried). Then moved on to the chicken ramen which was better than the ramen I've had in the Bay Area even. Milky, flavourful and satisfying.  Again I wish they have grilled chicken so I could keep my diet but so yummy sometimes so worth it !",1
5,All their gluten free options were delicious - I could even eat shoryu buns again! Great for tourists and residents alike. It does seem to get crowded around peak times though.,1
3,"First sip was somewhat bland but after it felt a lot more creamy and flavourful for a tonkotsu ramen.
Disagree with the Hirata Buns. Meat one was sub par compared to the many different buns offered using a japanese fusion take on things. The veggie one was different and actually special which pleased my vegetarian date.
Overall not too bad. Probably rare to find this type of cuisine in Europe but plenty of better ones in California and Toronto.",-1
4,"I came here on a rainy weekday at 5:30pm for linner and it was very empty. I guess everyone's off to the pubs at this time of the day. I decided to order the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu (minced pork) for a change and my friend ordered the Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu. After tasting my Karaka Tan Tan, the Kotteri Hakata tasted rather bland. The sous vide egg was pretty good. But I'd have to give it to Shoryu for having the best broth compared to Bone Daddies and Kanada-Ya. The broth was spicy, thick, and flavorful. Same goes for the noodles, the best compared to Bone Daddies and Kanada-Ya. I still much prefer thick ramen noodles though. It seems to me that thick ramen noodles are nonexistent in London. Overall great service and tasty ramen. A must try!",1
5,"Super delicious ramen, authentic, with some frills. Beautiful decor with the mirrored bar shelves. Close to the craziness of Piccadilly circus but a nice respite from crowds and loud children. Much better than ethnic restaurants in the surrounding area and better than any restaurant in Chinatown!",1
4,"Excellent ramen. If you are looking for a bit of flavor in London, this is the place. The service is slow, though. Also, beware that there are ABSOLUTELY no substitutions. We could not even get a plate of sliced plain cucumbers (cucumber salad was on the menu). That was fairly ridiculous.",1
4,"Shoryu was a top place to go on a chilly summer night. The ramen was pretty good. The noodles seemed a bit undercooked and the broth was so-so, but the egg was one of the best things I've ever tasted. Would come back next time I'm in London.",1
5,"I went back on got over my ramen envy from last time and got a shoryu ramen. I will die a happy girl. 
The egg wasn't as good as last time, but I'm not sure if that whole raw food thing scared the shit out of London eateries. But egg aside, we also ordered some cocktails, initially ordered a lemongrass one, but they made the wrong one and gave me a shochu sours. But everything has a bright side. SHOCHU SOURS FOR LYF. 
Yes. It was that good.",1
5,"My first visited the one near canary street and the best Ramen I ever had, then went to the one in Soho couple week later..not really feel the same at all, may be different Ramen I ordered.",1
4,"""Irasshaimase!"". Immediately as you enter, you're greeted with a boisterous traditional Japanese welcome. It pretty much sets the tone that you're in for something authentic. Its run by the same people as the Japan Centre across the road. If the Japanese shop there, they'll probably be eating here, so you won't be disappointed.
We ordered the Shoryu Tonkotsu and the Piri Piri Tonkotsu (which had just the right spicy kick). Both had pickled white ginger in it ...great for sushi, but too over-powering for soup noodles. It was shoved out the bowl and piled high on the complementary pickled red cabbage starter dish. We accompanied our meal with a side order of soft shell crab instead of the more traditional gyoza.
On our waiter's recommendation, we finished the meal with the sponge cake (not on the menu). It was light and filled with fresh cream, and topped off with a macha sprinkling.
Overall, a great eating experience for pre-movies or pre-theatre dining. I'd give it 5-stars, but that's reserved for Daikokuya in LA's Japan Town.

5,The vegan white natural soup was amazing. I've tried many vegetarian ramens and this was by far the best tasting broth I have ever had. It's a pity I discovered it on my second to last day in London.,1
1,"We didn't even try the food but the service was horrible. We walked in and it was packed. I stood in front of the door and I probably eyed every waitstaff there and didn't get an acknowledgment.  I didn't get asked for how many until a min later. The wait was about 10mins which was fine... I see it was busy. Then another table of 4 came in and they knew one of the workers there... And the guy started to look for a table for them. In short we were overlooked and our table was given to someone else. We weren't too happy about that, so we left. 
Doesn't matter who your customer know or not know you shouldn't be seating someone ahead of customers who came first when there is a table for them.",-1
4,"I have become a fairly regular customer at the Denman Street Shoryu and this was my first trip to the 'other' Shoryu Ramen. 
I can happily say that the food is just as good here. The ambience is the same as well. 
I had a cold ramen - the chef's special something, it was - and it came with the Ramen on a straw mat with ice below it. Very visually appealing and definitely worth the 12 pounds-ish that I paid for it. 
The seating is a bit close together and it can be uncomfortable if you are here to have some intimate conversation. Of course, its not a problem if you can talk in a few different languages (Hindi, Malayalam, English) according to the people sitting around you - making sure that your privacy is maintained. Haha.",1
4,"A short walk from Piccadilly Circus, you'll find a cozy little ramen shop that serves up hot noodles, broth and tea. As a first timer, I took the safe route and picked the popular Karaka Miso Buta Tonkatsu Ramen (9.90), and although there was a tiny mix up with our orders, it got to us eventually, and still in quick fashion. I must say I was quite pleased with my selection... the broth was tasty, not too heavy, and the portion size was just right. Another treat was the Genmai Tea, I couldn't stop drinking it, it was so good! Oh yeah, get the gyoza. There's nothing ever really special about gyoza, but it's always good. Service was quick and attentive and they even gave us coupons for next time. Need something hot to warm up on these cold winter days? Ramen might just hit the spot.",1
5,"Great service, amazing food...get the dumplings (guitar) and the shoryu buns and have fun beyond that...such a cool place",1
2,"Having tried the other recent Ramen places that have popped up in London, I thought I'd give this place the chance.... Now I know it's all personal preference but this place wasn't for me. To be fair I went for the signature  tonkatsu (as I have in all the others) all the ingredients were there and the noodles were good, however the soup just was a little salty and bland. We accompanied the Ramen with steamed pork buns that were very good though!! 
The layout of the restaurant is a little bit awkward also, the entrance door inconveniences at least two tables and if you need to use the only toilet then you will again have to disturb people.
Overall, fairly good and slightly cheaper than the rest but defiantly trailing  the others in my opinion.",-1
5,"I've become a regular here since I first came 2 years ago. It's one of our go to restaurants when we're in central London (which is almost daily). It's always busy but we rarely have to wait for a seat for more than 10mins - service is fast and food is always amazing. I'd say this is my favourite ramen place above others such as Bone Daddies, Koya or Tonkotsu. I think the broth and noodle have the best texture/consistency/flavour out of them all! We also go to the Shoryu in King Street but this is still my favourite one.",1
3,"So much ramen, so little time. And you need time if you want to go to Shoryu as the line is quite often 10-15 people long on any given evening. We went on the soft-opening week which meant the line was even longer although props to the staff for shoving us in as fast as possible and having no qualms about asking random people to sit together.  However, I didn't quite understand why they split the group up when the table the first pair was given was more than enough for all of us. We swapped the randoms for our friends and everyone was happy (except for the waitress who looked like she was about to punch a hole in the wall).
The Ramen itself was good (I chose the Shoryu Special) with a rich creamy white broth that was an excellent argument on its own for taking the slow boil method for making tonkotsu stock. The pork itself wasn't that flavourful and I remember being a little disappointed in the low amount of veggies. Those that were there were excellent and so was the egg. The bowl is a massive serving and I happily slurped my way into fatty pork nirvana.
It's a bit cramped inside with the planners seemingly hell bent on working out how to maximise the number of people per square meter. Be prepared to get close to some strangers and even cosier with your friends. Then again, we all survive the tube in rush hour so by comparison this is downright luxurious! 
In the London Ramen rankings, the overall food is good but not enough to dethrone Bone Daddies as the London Ramen King!",-1
3,solid ramen place. Not the best ramen i have had but not the worst. the service is pretty good. solid place if you are in central and want ramen.,-1
5,"A die hard fan of ramen, I can safely say that ShorYu's ramen will not disappoint. Eggs could have been done better, but the broth was delicious!",1
4,"And so continues my ramen quest!  I just moved here, and I'm on a mission to find my favorite ramen restaurant in London.  So far nothing makes me want to strip naked and jump inside the hot vat of soupy goodness, ecstatically yelling YES as I beat two slices of pickled turnips together in excitement.
Shoryu was half full by the time I got there at 7 pm, but packed by the time I left at 8.  I was seated quickly, and ordered the £9.9 Takana Tonkotsu with a £3 side of menma and £1.5 of egg, as well as the £6 shishito peppers.  Nice but quite expensive additions.  5 minutes later (I do appreciate the fast service here, way faster than Bone Daddy's), I had a hot steaming bowl of ramen.  They're not stingy with the portion either.
The noodles were al dente and the broth was certainly flavorful, but missing the fattiness that I prefer.  In fact, it was a bit watery. I preferred the pork at BD as it was softer and fattier.  
Update: I came here again, and ordered the Wasabi Tonkotsu and Karaka Miso Buta Tonkotsu.  Loved the Buta Tonkotsu, there were tons of ground pork in it and the noodles were perfect!  Couldn't really taste much of the wasabi in the other tonkotsu, definitely preferred the Buta.",1
5,"IMO, far and away the best ramen in London (after Shoryu, of the places I've been I'd rank them Tonkotsu, Ittenbari, Bone Daddies, Yugo, Mitsukoshi). Good noodles, egg is of the perfect doneness, and the tonkotsu broth is fantastic, very balanced.
My personal favorite (and supposedly the favorite of the staff) is the Karaka Tantan Tonkotsu, spicier and with garlic.
I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area and I'd say Shoryu is similar in quality to Ramen Dojo there, and also similar in that they both have spicy ramen. Personally, I don't think anywhere else in London comes close.",1
4,"Had a great bowl of Ramen hear a couple days back. Was really craving some good quality ramen after all the cold and the rain this week in London. I came on a weekday afternoon around 4pm, it was pretty empty at that time and I was seated immediately.
I ordered the special Hakata Tonkotsu ramen with spicy ground pork. It was very rich and flavorful. I could really taste the good quality of each of the ingredients, and then broth had a very unique taste compared to other ramen broths I've had.
Service and ambiance were good, no complaints as I did come at an off peak time.
I would recommend this place for good quality, flavorful ramen!",1
4,"The key to a great ramen is the broth. The broth here is great, therefore the ramen is great.
I had the char siu ramen - the original ramen plus extra pork, and my wife had the Dracula ramen, which had caramelised garlic. I got to try her broth at the end: it was garlicky indeed, but still very nice. Noodles were cooked just right and the pork slices were nice. As you would expect, mine had a lot of pork slices which were a treat. An unusual element was the pickled ginger. It's a surprise when you eat it, but makes for a good occasional contrast to the rest of the ramen.
We got our usual sides of karaage chicken and gyoza. The gyoza came with a nice ginger dipping sauce. The karaage chicken was made from chicken breast, which was ok but I have noticed that the thigh meat has more flavour and is juicier.
We got an Asahi each too. They came with a half pint glass of the sort you would find in an English pub, which I liked.
Our total bill came to £48 with service.  This is about average or just under for the ramen places that we have visited in London. I would come back here, but probably just for the ramen.
The place is an easy walk, just down the hill, from Picadilly tube station.  There was a small queue outside when we got there at around 6:30pm and this grew during the evening.  This is something to bear in mind - however, ramen appears to be one of the trendy things at the moment, so most good ramen places would be like this.",1
4,"If you're wondering about that wasabi tonkotsu, I too was curious before finally coming here on Sunday.. I had checked out their ramen selection in advance to see what they had to offer compared to the other ramen joints..and wasabi ramen is definitely a new one for me.
 
So I will start with the con. They have a scoop of pasty wasabi shavings when your bowl is brought out untouched, along with the atypical bean sprouts, earwigs, pork, and two sheets of seaweed (sorry, gotta pay extra for an egg!). The pasty wasabi shaving was not very potent, especially when I mixed it in with my broth. The beauty of wasabi is that spicy zing shooting up one's nose with every bite, and I had imagined every bite of this ramen would do me the same justice; on the contrary, it was very subtle. I have seen broth prepared with wasabi oil to give it a strong kick but this broth is not wasabi flavored and the only thing giving it the wasabi love was the scoop of wasabi bits on top of the noodles. Don't get me wrong, the broth was excellent, very milky and not overtly salty.. but just wasn't what I was expecting when ordering wasabi tonkotsu. While there's no doubt you can make out the faint taste of wasabi, the taste was too repressed for me. Don't lie to yourself and say you've ever gone for wasabi wishing it were only a faint kick! In my opinion, if the depth of wasabi flavor is not there, it really is just another bowl of tonkotsu ramen, with a hint of wasabi. I told the waitress who said she'd convey it to the chef, so maybe there will be a slight change next time?
On the other hand, the ramen had veerry good noodles. I am a big fan of thin straight ramen noodles (as opposed to curly or flat ones). These were straight, firm, and a little chewy, which to me is an example of well-made ramen noodles. It's always easy to make it too soggy and I don't enjoy it when it's bordering that opaque look, but as I said, these were firm chewy tender noodles with great flavor. They were very yellow too, so these were probably made with a higher egg content, giving it that yellow hue and flavor that reminds me of Chinese egg noodles (but with nicer texture). Another pro was that the egg was pretty delicious as well. It's no ""dayum..dayum..DAYUM"" (see review on Bone Daddies on my usage of the Dayum scale) but still great execution. It was not as runny as I would like it but it wasn't overcooked and you can still see the soft, creamy, orangey glow in the middle. So the main difference was that it wasn't as beautifully runny like Bone Daddies' egg, but to me it was marinated to perfection and not overly salty as Bone Daddies' eggs. The same goes for the pork. They were not overwhelming large slices; in fact, I usually save the pork for the end and when I reached the end, in hindsight, I think I only got one slice total? It was either one slice or one and a half slices. Not the most protein one could wish for but it was tasty. And I was too busy wolfing down my noodles anyways. 
Lastly, Shoryu Ramen doesn't have a bar area for one-person parties (is it a party if there's only one person :( ?). I always think ramen joints should keep with tradition to have single seats, for those who want to sidle in for a quick eat. That's the true beauty of eating ramen like fast-food as they do in Japan! Instead, they have a couple of small tables, and a long booth seat along the wall with small tables to section parties off. Meh, guess I'll just have to find some friends to come with!",1
5,"It did hit a spot! 
We are visiting London for the first time and found this place. We were so happy because our 4 year old daughter finished her bowl! She likes eating good ramen.",1
1,"So I was with someone who's been here before and after a rather long debate, this place seemed to be one of the few places that are open late (up to London standards that is). The ambience was nice and the decor as per the usual ramen bar (no Bone Daddies rockability theme here).
The food seemed rather adventurous for a ramen place - an interesting mix of flavours with funky names. 
It did take some time for it to arrive at the table (especially given the fact that everyone was leaving by the time we got there).Anyway, pretty good food, matching that generally offered in London. I've ordered the Tokyo Shoryu.  The broth was fine, the noodles tasted rather good and he toppings were OK, just your typical japanese inspired out-of-the-tin vegetables with meat. Soft shell crab was rather soggy, but I wasn't expecting any miracles here.
What was excruciatingly horrible was the service. 
Yes, we turned up late and our food was late. However when I discovered a hair in my food I got extremely upset by the fact that no one had the courage to come to me and apologise/offer a refund as they usually do in such places. I hadn't touched more than half of my food and no response - extremely unprofessional and definitely not what one would expect from such a central London location. 
I saw the floor manager who was only able to offer an apology and had the service charge taken - something that I found rather disrespectful for both the staff and I as the service was generally good.
I don't know if I'd go back - possibly I'd try the other branch but this place needs to invest more on customer care.",-1
4,"Pretty good food.  Looks nice and clean.  I wish there was a bit more variety in the ingredients and types of meats.  I'd probably go there again, primarily because there's a lack of good restaurants in this part of town.",1
4,The best ramen shop in all of Europe! Proper-est!! The noodle and the soup are authentic and good. But my ramen was served rather lukewarm. :(,1
4,"Hot bowl of ramen = Perfect remedy for a freezing cold London day! 
Had to queue outside for about a half hour to get a table for two, but that was expected and so worth it. Something that stood out to me and I just have to mention it, is that they have a heat lamp for all of us eager ramen-craving freezing patrons right outside of the entrance. How thoughtful :) 
We started with the pork belly hirata buns. The bread was fluffy and the meat was tender, delicious. A little bit of spiciness, which was unexpected but tolerable enough for a spice-wimp like me. Then came the main event. I had the Tokyo Shoyu and it was amazing. The broth was full of flavour and the pork, veggies & noodles were all delectable. The portion was enormous and I was fully stuffed and satisfied at the end of the meal. Great place!",1
5,"Stopped in with my mom after reading other reviews.  We were seated quickly and were told about the menu and their specialties. We weren't planning on getting any buns, but it happened to be 2-for-1 bun night. We ordered two bowls of ramen and two pork belly buns. 
The ramen came out hot and flavorful, very large portions. The buns were a good size and very good. If we ever visit London again, I would definitely come back and I would order more buns and share a bowl of ramen.",1
5,"The Takana was pretty amazing! Our Japanese entourage concurred the noodles were legit and the gyoza were pretty amazing as well. It's a small little shop in one of the busiest spots of London, which means you might hit a queue. I was pretty lucky at noon on a weekend and we only waited about 10 min but by the time we left, the wait looked considerably longer. 
There seems to be a lot of ramen popping up around town, if you're on the hunt to compare, put Shoryu on your shortlist.",1
4,"Came up to London to fulfill some Japanese Ramen cravings with my friends. Totally worth the 1.5-2 hours for our trip. I asked what the most popular dish was and the waitress told me the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu. I absolutely LOVED it! At first I was confused on why I didn't have any Chashyu, and then I realized that I had gotten ""pan fried minced pork"" this was so much more delicious than the chashyu (pork slices). The meat was very juicy, a little bit too salty, but I liked it that way. There was a good portion of noodles and the bowl was quite large. I also liked the spicyness of the ramen dish!
If I lived in London, I would eat here as often as I could! I think the price is very reasonable and there are a bunch of side dishes that you can get as well. The place was quite upscale looking and super clean!",1
3,"Dinner
Went there with my cousin and her boy friend. In total it costed £40 for three of us. Therefore i shouldn't be so judge mental? However, ramen in Japan is a serious topic, can be the theme for life. 
I think it could earn four stars as the quality of food was great overall, but the bean sprout tasted old, kinda sourly almost people from FSA will question about its freshness. Shame.
Maybe it's one off.
Thus highly recommended for a casual dinner.",-1
5,Most amazing ramen! We eat ramen in New York often and this is even better. We went multiple times on our short trip. LOVE!,1
5,"I am a ramen-freak. It's what I crave when I am happy, sad, stressed, or celebrating. Shoryu satisfies all my cravings and it amazing!
Coming from New York, I have a pretty high standard for ramen (at least I would like to think so), so once I moved here, I had to find here I could feast on delicious pork belly and noodles. After reading a bunch of reviews I tried a few places out, and so far Shoryu is my favorite. I've been back a few times since finding it too. Each time I come hungry because the bowls are massive! And of course I have to save room for the fantastic hirata pork buns!
The place is relatively small and cramped, but that's London for small restaurants. It is still very nice and the atmosphere is great. Servers greet you when you come in and the servers are always nice and efficient. 
If you need a dose of ramen in your life check this place out. I have gone with native Chinese and Japanese friends and they give their stamp of approval too! 
The broth is always salty and deliciously umami-like, the meet is tender, and the noodles don't lose their sogginess after ten minutes in the bowl, which is nice. 
Go, feast, enjoy, return.",1
5,"I am a devoted Ramen fan who spent years in Japan actively seeking the perfect bowl of noodles.  I even took it so far as collecting business cards from all the shops and making a binder with notes on each.  Of course, you have to judge Ramen outside Japan with a slightly relaxed standard, because it's hard to replicate the full environment.
That said, Shoryu is a solid bowl of noodles.  Tonkotsu is my favorite variety of Ramen, and these guys get it right.  The soup is thick and fragrant and the noodles have the right amount of chewiness.  I only go to London a few times per year, but Shoryu is definitely on my must-go list from now on.",1
5,"This is one of those places in London that satisfies my ramen craving. Love love loooove.
When I first entered the restaurant, gongs were sounded based by the number of people you have in your party. *so honoured* Then we were sat, and a complimentary small saucer filled with cold yet crunchy cabbage(?) is served. 
For my first time here I ordered the Dracula ramen. It is one of the newer food options and it's delicious! Definitely gives you garlic breath after to ward off the vampires later on, but who cares? Great food requires great sacrifices. 
Second time was Yuzu ramen for me. Might feel weird at first glance because yuzu is a citrus fruit, but when mixed with the salty tonkotsu base, it is actually something quite sensational. Not one of my favourites, but my impression of Shoryu is still higher than ever. 
Love the ambience here as well - although everyone is sat pretty close, it's not too noisy and the lighting and overall decoration and furniture makes it a good mix of classy and cosy. 
The service here is amazing - I can tell that they try to emulate the Japanese service here, and that makes it so welcoming to me. 
Price-wise is reasonable in comparison to other ramen restaurants in London. Shoryu definitely wins in the value-for-money department. 
Will come back again and again and again. I'll never be bored of ramen.",1
5,"This is a fantastic, traditional ramen place with reasonable pieces and good drinks. I've been to Japan 40 times and j would come back here in a heartbeat.",1
3,Ordered two ramen n a black sesame tofu. I'm in love with the tofu but not a ramen fan sorry. The dining place is a bit small. We feel lucky to have a friendly n fast service thank you,-1
4,"Well isn't this place an absolute delight! Ramen is pretty much tailor made for miserable London winters and as the days get progressively greyer and grimmer, I'll be making a beeline for Shoryu. You should too. The noodles are fresh and bountiful (perhaps a little too bountiful but there are worse problems to have, hey), the broth rich and flavoursome and the meat and veggies seasoned to perfection. The gyoza is also pretty great, but there's no way you'll have space for it after the ramen. Honestly, if I didn't you won't. On top of this, the setup is really nice and cosy and does away with the canteen style feel that often comes with ramen spots. I'll be back.",1
2,Im still looking for any sort of flavor in the vegetarian ramen (am i asking for the moon?!),-1
5,"Love my asian soups and especially Ramen.  Wow did this place impress and surpass my favorite NYC ramen places.   Aside from the impeccably authentic ramen with velvet noodles and broth, the side orders were also exceptional (pork belly buns were unbelievably fluffy, the gyoza was rediculously crisp, shrimp tempura was light and crispy and my kids devoured the tempura Brussels sprouts).   This place is the real deal and a must stop for Ramen lovers.",1
5,Amazing Ramen place! A bit crowded but service was reasonable. We had two different kinds of ramen and buns. Buns were a great surprise. The ramen was served at perfect temperature and was really tasty. The wife had never had ramen and doesn't eat much soup but was really excited afterwards and ready to go back on our next trip!,1
5,This is a chain in the city but the ramen is great. We were glad we got their early as by 6:30 there was a line outside. Great place for a casual and quick meal. So good we are here twice on our trip!,1
4,Excellent ramen.  Good service.  Kirin Ichiban on tap.  A little pricey and a little cramped.,1
4,"The broth was rich and tasty! The noodles were cooked perfectly - not too soft, not too hard! We only waited for about 20 mins or so on a Saturday night so that wasn't too bad. Service was alright and we can't wait to go back again~!",1
2,"I'm really disappointed at the quality of this restaurant. I ordered a Karaage and Shoryu Ramen .Karaage was good but the Ramen did not have much of a taste.  the noodle was not japanese one it maybe Chainese noodle ??.......it was too soft noodle.
I will try ohter Ramen shop .........",-1
3,"I would have given it 4 stars. The service was very polite and nice but inattentive. I waited forever to place an order, and waited forever to get attention to get the dessert menu, and almost knocked the waitress serving the next table over, actually she almost knocked me over, as I was trying to leave.  Food was pretty good. Ramen soup (tonkutso) was excellent, and yummily garnished. I had the matcha ramen and was good. succulent texture. Hirata bun was oversized, fluffy and pillowy, and chewy, but there was something indecently inelegant about it. Pork belly was ok - doesn't quite melt in your mouth and of course you couldnt go wrong with the mayo. Mmmm. I also tried the gluten free hirata bun and they microwaved it!! So the ends ended up being very hard. But where I could chew it was actually tasty and the texture quite good - not as soft and pillowy but decent and tasty! If you are going for the gf hirata buns (which only comes in chicken), ask them not to microwave but to steam it.  The matcha tea was absolutely disappointing. It said stoneground in restaurant but it was hardly tasty - i felt like i was drinking plain water.",-1
1,"I was in London on holiday craving some ramen and found this spot listed on a lot of dining lists for top ramen spot in London. I decided to check it out and ordered some standard miso ramen and an order of pork buns. The pork buns came out first and it was not yummy at all! Seems like the pork belly was old and the buns were not soft at all - instead of being nicely steamed it tasted and looked like frozen microwaved pork buns. The ramen was underwhelming as well. The eggs were not cooked how I liked (yokey yellow and brown soy sauce soaked). The noodles were ok, I've had much better. The noodles tasted like they were sitting out in room temperature for too long. The broth was very watered down. I was so upset after reading good reviews about this place and left 80% of my order untouched.",-1
2,"Disappointing, both relative to other ramen restaurants in London and as an experience in and of itself. I found my main dish average (though for full disclosure, I ate the Tori Kara-Age Men which is not made with their famous pork broth) and the surrounding dishes (with the exception of a delicious Chicken Bun) unexciting. The sashimi sampler tasted as if had been sitting out for a while. And the fruit flies that were buzzing around during our meal also didn't help the ambiance... Needless to say, I was expecting more from my meal at Shoryu. And good service from a pleasant and attentive waitstaff could not make up for mediocre food.",-1
4,"I was strolling through Piccadilly Circus area on Sunday on my first day in town on business.  It was about 1230 or so and I got seated quickly.  After looking at several choices, I picked the Tan Tan.  A fantastic silky tonkatsu broth, with nori, egg, scallions, pickled ginger and loads of chili oil :).
As I was finishing I saw a crowd by the window.  I hadn't realized it but the placed filled up to capacity right after me and there were 15 or so people waiting in line!  
It was a very good bowl of ramen and worth the visit!",1
1,"Let me start by saying I am Japanese, spent the first 18 years of my life there, and have spent the last 25 in New York City, where there is plenty of and an increasing amount of ramen competition, that most ramen connoisseurs would be proud of.  I adore ramen, and am comfortable claiming myself as a connoisseur.
I am not trying to be racist, but there is a non-Japanese manager at Shoryu, who does not understand how ramen is properly consumed.  I ordered the most simple combination of a bowl of ramen and an order of gyoza.  As any seasoned ramen eater knows, each of those dishes are good on their own, but eating them together is what makes the experience whole.  Well  I received my gyoza within 5 minutes of ordering (great), but did not receive my ramen for another half hour (not great).  Given the standard ritual, I of course held off on eating my gyoza until the ramen came, and by then, it was cold, greasy, and to be honest, slimy.
Now the ramen.  The soup (I had the piri piri tonkotsu) was not bad.  The noodles felt and tasted a bit like soba noodles, i.e. too straight, and too hard.  And worst of all, they make the same mistake that so many foreign ramen outposts do - they pile on the vegetables and other stuff, taking away from the taste of the ramen itself, perhaps to fool you into thinking you're getting a good bang for your buck.  True ramen, as most know, shouldn't be adulterated by too much ""gu"" , so you can let your tastebuds focus on and appreciate the simple noodle and soup combination.
When I complained to said manager about the half hour gap between the gyoza and ramen, she simply said sorry, and quickly stuck another customer in front of me - they make you share tables, so as not to slow down business.  So those of you who feel weird about eating at a small table for two with a perfect stranger sitting eighteen inches in front of you, maybe you should venture elsewhere.  Very different from sitting next to someone at a counter, even though you are just as close.
With very mediocre ramen and horrible service, I will continue to wait for the awesome ramen shop this city so desperately needs.",-1
5,"This place is exquisite! From the space to the service and WOW, the food. I have been twice and ordered different items each time and all were fantastic! Leave you assumptions about Indian cuisine behind this food es exotic and yet entirely accessible. Well done Cinnamon Club! I'll come
Everytime I am
In London",1
4,"This restaurant was recommended to us by my husbands brother-in-law. It's tucked away in a gorgeous building, I actually couldn't find a sign with the restaurant name. When you look up at it from the street, it looks like a library, and you see no tables. Just people moving around. I found it once I put it in my google maps to walk. 
We arrived 45 minutes after our reservation time and the hosts was still happy to seat us and didn't mind we were late, probably because it wasn't busy. 
The prices are high for the food as others have said, but my husband and I left full. We ordered two starters, and for the main course, we shared the malai kofta. It was all delicious (maybe too much cardamom though?). I wasn't a fan of the aloo paratha though. It tasted more oniony than potatoey. 
The waiters and waitresses were so kind and professional. 
I'd definitely recommend this place!",1
3,"I'd like to start by saying that this place is gorgeous. It's a sexy dinner house located in London's first public library. Which is just cool! They pride themselves on a vast and very interesting gin menu. They also advertise a awesome gin and tonic service by a professional gin and tonic bartender... but the delivery is abut of a letdown... the lovely stuttering young man that was manning the gin cart, stuttered through the gin presentation that he was reading off a card... and he wasn't stuttering because he had a stutter, he had very obviously never served a gin and tonic before.
Then there was the food. We ordered butter chicken, The tasting of mushroom which featured a large and dry portobello, a mushroom briyani with wayyyy to much star anice, a butter chicken that was just ...meh, lamb with saffron which was underwhelming.  We also ordered a  bread basket that was very good and chutney tray that came with a mind blowing gooseberry chutney. All together a 3 star experience... I think we just expected more.",-1
5,"Amazing is all I have to say. From the service to the food. Impecable service. Exquisite dishes. We ordered two desserts which I didn't take pictures because they disappeared, but our wonderful waiter sent us a third dessert at no charge.",1
3,"This place has a lot of positives, but many negatives as well. 
I'll start with the negatives:
1. It's very expensive for the amount of food you're given. We were barely full after the meal.
2. The mango lassi doesn't taste very authentic. I can pinpoint what was off about it, but it didn't taste like a traditional mango lassi, like many other restaurants have.
3. It took a very long time to get our bill at the end of the meal (about 20 minutes). Our waiter forgot about us, so I had to eventually request it.
4. They should distinguish better between what water costs money and what doesn't. To clarify, request tap water if you don't want to be charged for a bottle of water or more.
However, I did enjoy some aspects about it:
1. It was beautiful! It used to be a library, which made for a very interesting & unique aesthetic during our meal. 
2. The service, other than my negatives above, was great. They sat us quickly and we had some good conversation with our waiter.
I probably wouldn't recommend this place unless it's a very special occasion.",-1
2,Service is not equivalent to this level of restaurant. The food was reasonable but not terrific. Service was below this level of restaurant in London.  Go to a good curry house instead.,-1
1,"I have been in food service now for 33 years.  I have eaten at many Indian restaurants in five countries and numerous states.
It was a Tuesday night around eight and the place was busy.  The prices on the menu included a $130 tasting menu and main courses as much as $50.  Starters began at $18.  I am translating to US dollars @1.4 to 1 pound.
1.  The first thing to arrive at my table was a Mango Lassi.  It was a very small drink for $10 and came with a soapy aftertaste.  
2.  The garlic naan was cooked incorrectly TWICE, something that even children in India are tasked with.  To make matters worse, the first attempt was served after it cooled(see #3). The tandoori oven was too hot causing it to not rise correctly while cooking... In India I saw a monkey that was in charge of a tandoori bread oven, so can you imagine how easy it should be.
3.  I had an asparagus starter that was sent to the table after it lost its temperature.  The flavor profile was nice, despite it's delayed delivery.
4.  I chose the butter chicken for a main course since there were only three or four meat options, while most Indian restaurants of at least fifteen different options.  It was an over cooked breast without enough sauce to accompany it.
5.  Dessert, not a chance after that train wreck.
In summary, this is a businessperson's(tourist) environment in a nice building with fancy table cloths.  Selling alcohol is CLEARLY the priority.  Service was horrible relative to the price.  My server had no support staff and that is insane for the amount they are charging.
I later learned of a place call Brick Lane(?) where locals go to get REAL Indian food.",-1
3,"I thought it was okay, perhaps a little pricy with smaller portions. We were seated in the upper area, which had an incredibly strange layout because they had clearly moved tables around to accommodate other parties - so to the left of us was a giant gaping hole in the middle of the dining area which just looked rather strange.
We opted for some kind of prix-fixe corse that related to the Royal wedding, it said it was a traditional Bengali wedding course. It came out on a platter and each dish was about the size of 1 cup (sorry, American units) and for me, was really hit and miss between all of them. Whatever dish the giant prawn was in though, was one of the best Indian dishes I've had of all time. The bread was dense, but a bit overly greasy. The service was slightly inattentive. The locale was hard to find (it's not labeled from the outside) and if someone hadn't seen us looking so confused and asked us if were looking for the Cinnamon Club, we probably would have walked past it a few times. The interior was beautiful, but we were seated in the upper area so we could barely see/appreciate any of it. It was a neat place to come but I was a bit disappointed that we were seated upstairs because that defeated most of the reasons why we had decided to come here in the first place. I probably won't be back anytime soon.",-1
4,"My friends were visiting from the U.S. last week and they suggested ""high end Indian"" for dinner on Friday night. I haven't had a lot of experience with this niche category, as to me Indian usually means the neighbourhood curry joint or one of the go-tos around Whitechapel or Brick Lane. But I've definitely heard of quite a few big names, and after thorough research, I would conclude that there are at least 8 high end / Michelin Indian establishments in London, which could really only happen in a city like London. Given this was Thursday night and I was trying to make a booking for Friday night, they were all fully booked and the best I could do was an 8:45 PM booking at the Cinnamon Club. So that's how we ended up at the Cinnamon Club.
That said, it is a fantastically impressive place to take visitors to London. It's located not far from Westminster, so on our cab ride over there was an impromptu viewing of the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament. The building is the former Westminster Library, and the walls are filled with an impressive collection of old books. There is even a plaque outside to commemorate the history. We were in a chatty mood and too busy catching up to contemplate the menu, so we went for the full tasting menu. It was priced at £85, and we got a bottle of Sangiovese to share. In hindsight, I wouldn't particularly recommend that wine, but there were some other reasonably priced options on the wine list, as well as the high end that you would expect.
I would describe the food as fine dining with an Indian flair, mostly with a strong dose of spices. But it is completely recognizable from your typical curry and rice / naan (in fact we never saw rice or naan during the whole meal!) There was a heavily spiced soup that was perhaps the strongest indication that the meal was Indian influenced. But otherwise, there was a salmon carpaccio, some seasonal squab, and poached pear with ice cream, among others. When we ordered, I had asked how long the tasting menu would take, and they indicated 2-3 hours, which was about right (I think we were about 2.5 hours). So it's not a huge endeavour to undertake (having done some 5 hour tasting menus), and just the right amount of food (we didn't feel like we overate).
Overall I would definitely recommend the experience (especially for visitors), but given it's fine dining rather than your local curry house, I'm not in a rush to go back again.",1
3,"For my first trip to the UK, I was really looking forward to trying some LEGIT Indian food. A co-worker recommended Vivek Singh's Cinnamon Club, so we made a reservation. It sounded conceptually awesome! As we jumped out of our Uber, it was hard to tell we were at the right place, as the entrance is a bit unwelcoming.
The atmosphere was very contemporary. From the bright lighting and modern furniture to the service, we were set up for a fine dining experience. But that's not actually what we experienced...
We started with a selection of chutneys. 3 arrived... one was delightfully spicy and the other two were siiiiiickly sweet. I've had my fair share of stateside naan and hoped my UK experience would be even more flavorful. Not at all... all of the bread was fine at best. The varieties were lost on me.
My tablemate and I decided to share the ""Old Delhi style"" butter chicken on the bone which came with, black lentils, pilau rice and more garlic naan. We added the chilled bitter melon, pickled shallot and cucumber salad, and the home-style split yellow peas with cumin.
First up, the sides were mediocre. The only thing that stood out was the bitter melon salad, which had an incredible flavor and texture. Everything else was surprisingly bland! Like, scratch your head bland, why is there no salt on the table bland.
And for the chicken? The sauce and flavors were INCREDIBLE. Deep, dark, full of mouth feel and just... wow wow wow. But... for some bizarre reason, as it was prepared table side, I was served only wing parts, while my companion got thigh and white meat... cutting through and trimming meat off the bone when I just wanted to eat was beyond disappointing. We only realized the strange serving error as we shared notes after the dinner in our cab.
Will I be back? More than likely not. For the price and flavors, it's just not worth it. Don't get me wrong, it's an incredibly lovely restaurant. But for the price, it should be perfect, which it is nowhere near.",-1
4,"My husband and I were very excited about this meal and it lived up to expectations for the most part. The restaurant vibe and aesthetics were awesome. The food, also awesome. The reason I gave 4 stars was due to the service. We felt others around us were getting good service but we seemed to get less attention. It was terrible but for where my expectations were at it could have been better.  
I had the sea bass and my husband had the red deer. The sea bass was super delicious w red lentils and a delicious curry sauce. 
Also the bar area on the bottom floor was super cool and stylish! Definitely pick this as a cocktail stop!!",1
5,"As aficionados of Indian cuisine, we were eager to visit the Cinnamon Club. We were not disappointed. The fact that they are open later than many restaurants was much appreciated, as we were coming from the theatre. All of the dishes and condiments were excellent. I highly recommend the gin cart, which gives you a very personal experience and is an excellent way to discover new and interesting gins. The library ambiance is lovely as well and the book titles provide for interesting conversation.",1
2,"I took my family on the recommendation of a colleague while we were in London.  My wife and I dearly love Indian cuisine, and he stated this was the best the old city could offer.  We made reservations and went with great expectations.
When we arrived, we were greeted warmly and asked to wait in the library bar as we were a bit early for our (admittedly) early American dining hour.  We enjoyed a pricey, but quality, cocktail before being shown to the dining room.
We were pleasantly surprised they offered a tasting menu with wine pairings.  It was VERY pricey, but as we had never experienced this approach in Indian dining we decided to splurge.  
I won't get into the specifics of each dish, but let me just say we were pretty disappointed.  For the price, there was nothing special.  The food was good, but merely good doesn't cut it at that price point.  The wines, on the other hand, were excellent, and the wine steward was charming and knowledgeable.
When we returned home, our memories of great meals in the UK were from a local pub followed by a hole-in-the-wall curry shop where a ten quid plate of curry was recalled fondly.  This outrageously pricey meal didn't even register on the memorable experience meter.",-1
4,"Had lunch with my husband at Cinnamon Club yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. 
Ambiance is nice. I love the library in general so eating in a library was pretty fabulous.
Service is courteous but not very friendly....here's where TCC loses one star.
Food is really fantastic:
- Green pea and potato cake was the highlight of my meal. I couldn't stop eating this, and neither could my husband (I didn't want to share).
- Grilled halibut was well received by my husband. I can't comment on the taste but the portion size was quite small.
- Baked plaice sole was good. Accompanying sauce was tasty as well.
- Organic roti and naan were very good. Love that they offer organic options.
- Mango sorbet was complimentary (for my birthday) and was delicious.
Prices were decent for a restaurant of this caliber.
The bottom line: we'd definitely return!",1
4,"Not your average Indian food!
Came here as none of my other options were available for my friends visit but it wasnt a disappointment.
This is really upscale and refined Indian food.
We had for starters: 
Okra filled with peanuts and jaggery (one of the tastiest okra Ive ever had) 
Sandalwood flavoured Norfolk free range chicken: the sauce was really good
Tandoori octopus with chutney aloo, perfectly cooked and the tomato and lemongrass dressing was gorgeous nicely spiced a must order! 
For mains: 
Chicken breast in pistaccio korma sauce 
Roast saddle of lamb with saffron sauce and root vegetable (it was my dish and it was gorgeous!) 
Tandoori loin of Oisin red deer, was also very tasty
And last but not least, the desserts: 
Dark chocolate paan: very tasty and interesting texture
Green cardamom brulee: really good the cardmom and realky going through the whole dessert!
Baked Jalhandar: think baked Alaska with Indian spices. It was just devine!
Overall this is a special occasion Indian feast but I loved how original the dishes were, far far away from your usual suspects",1
2,"Let's start with the positives.  The dishes themselves were quite nice and certainly not standard indian cuisine.  If you are hoping to eat some familiar standards like tikka masala, this is not the place.  However, the food overall was good, not great.  I really did like the library themed bar and the bartender was very nice.
The bad.  We arrived at 8:02 for an 8pm reservation and had to wait 30 minutes for our table.  Once we were told our table was ready we went back to the main entrance and waited another 2-3 minutes while both hostesses ignored us.  Finally once we were seated our food took forever to arrive.  Food arrive at 9:30.  
The manager wound up comping our drinks in the bar and several items from our meal.  I do appreciate them recognizing the service issues we had.  But all in all, even if we were seated on time and food came relatively quickly I probably still would have been a little underwhelmed given both the hype of this place and the plethora of other Indian restaurants in London.",-1
1,"Horrible services! This is the worst British restaurant we have ever been to. We have been to many different places, from Michelin star to local pub and no one is more arrogant and rude than this place. We have been sitting there for about 10 minutes when everyone is working around us and no one even stopped to even offer a water. Finally we put our order in and still no water and we have to keep asking. My little girl is too tired to walk and otherwise we will walk right to there. There are so many great curry places in London - with food so so and service like this, skip it and you will find much better places!",-1
5,"The food was excellent. The service was perfect - I could not find a flaw in either. And I am a connoisseur of Indian restaurants. This deserves a Michelin star for its food and service, surprised I don't see it. I am from the US where I have been to Michelin restaurants of much lower standard in flavor and service. Definitely worth visiting.",1
3,"I was rather disappointed with our meal in a restaurant with so many good reviews.  While our food was okay, it lacked consistency which is one of the themes for this restaurant.
Our starters were excellent and the preparation was flawless.  My wife had a chicken tikka.  I had an excellent Haddock fish cake.  Our entrees were not as good, my crab risotto was super salty and my wife's Haddock did not taste ""charbroiled"" and the consistency was mushy.  Our sides did not come out with our entrees and we had to remind them to bring them to our table.  Our second round of drinks showed up at the end of our meal.  We had two or three wait staff, not sure who was in charge.  So issue number two is the indifferent service.
Not a great review for place that gets good buzz in London.",-1
5,"There are few places where i have no reservations about giving a 5/5 review, but the Cinnamon Club is most definitely one of them.
A friend had been keen to visit the restaurant, especially after its recent refurbishment, so we decided to organise a Saturday brunch. The restaurant is so discreet one might have difficulties finding it (they've kept the old Westminster Library entrance) - upon entering you will see room to the left, which is the bar (please see photos), and the main restaurant ahead. The reception is well decorated with beautiful paintings, but the main restaurant has less - only because it's kept the original bookshelves from the old library. We were sat on the open ground floor, but there is an upper level (as one would find in a library setup) which may offer a more intimate setting if necessary. Words don't do the inner decor justice, so please refer to the photos.
On to the food - we were well greeted by the waiting staff and lead to our table. After sitting down we were offered complimentary rice cakes - even before the menus had arrived! The menu offers a variety of dishes. Some of us went with the set menu, others a la carte - the portions are just right and the seasoning perfect. The alphonso mango was a theme throughout the brunch, with me ordering alphonso mango lassi to drink. The food came beautifully presented, and tasting equally good. Between our starter and main, as well as the main and dessert, we were offered complimentary sweets and alphonso mango - this didn't feel forced or tacky - genuinely good fillers between meals. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly throughout the whole experience, even when we were leaving.
The price came to approx. £45 per person for two/three courses and a drink. We were well satisfied with the whole experience and are certain to return. 5/5 no qualms about it.",1
3,"Very high end Indian 'Nouvelle Cuisine' with small portions, sophisticated presentation. It's a far cry from 'regular' indian restaurants and the prices are, well..., high
The food was good, no doubts, but nothing exceptional either
Great service, very nice space in a library, just a little too stuffy for my taste, but some people may like it. Not a huge fan of the location either, behind Westminster Abbey, not much around...",-1
5,"Just an absolutely lovely, charming restaurant. The atmosphere is classic and refined without being stuffy. The food was of the highest quality and incredibly well-made. This would be a restaurant I wouldn't hesitate to go to on a special occasion or even take a guest or customers to. Highly recommended.",1
5,"Went there for celebrate my wife's birthday. The food was amazing with excellent presentation. The staff was friendly and the place had a soothing ambiance.
We had the sharing main of butter chicken which was more than enough for two.
After our meal we went to the bar downstairs and just like the restaurant it didn't disappoint us. 
We'll be visiting again soon",1
3,"A gorgeous backdrop and ambience as you enter for sure, however overall we were a bit disappointed that the service didn't live up to the expectations set.
Had a nice table in what used to be the ""reading room"", which offered a nice intimate setting.  We split the butter chicken for two and the dish was fantastic.  All the right blends of spices and creaminess you'd hope for.  The black daal was great, as other reviews have called out, and the naan was slightly above average as far as naan goes.  
The letdown was the service.  It was very disjointed (asking us as we sat down what we wanted to drink, then waiting about half an hour to cme back to take or food order) and on multiple occasions different waitstaff asked us the same question someone had just asked a couple minutes ago.  The price seemed justified for the location and the food, but factoring in the service it seemed a bit overpriced.
Improve the service and this turns into a 4-4.5 star experience, but as-is, an overall average experience",-1
4,"The appetizers were delightful. The okra was outstanding and the chicken tikka was a hit with the kids. We had 2 of the sharing main courses for 2. The Malai kofta was our favorite. The butter chicken was good, but we like it a bit spicier. The white Bordeaux we selected was outstanding.",1
5,"I was craving Indian food and found the Cinnamon Club and figured ""what the heck... lemme give it a try.""
I was blown away by the Cinnamon Club.
The interior and overall presentation felt like a proper British club from a 1950s movie with books on shelves, leather chairs, and all manner of other subtle and posh touches.
A drink in the bar was a treat. There were lots of different types of chairs, stools, benches, couches to sit on and the vibe was hushed, mellow, quiet, and romantic.
The main dining room was more vibrant. While the tables were close together, we rarely heard conversations from other tables.
The food was among the best I've tasted anyplace. The spices were subtle, complex, and absolutely perfectly complementary of each of the dishes. The presentation was worthy of any high end San Francisco restaurant.
There were a few glitches in the service (e.g., the naan was not delivered with the first course as we requested) and every glitch resulted in the food that was not delivered as we requested being removed from the bill... without us asking.
For me, the Cinnamon Club was the best of London posh club atmosphere combined with the kind of complexity and presentation that one associates with San Francisco combined with food that is the best Indian food I've ever had.
All-in-all, worth the price for the excellent food and overall experience.",1
3,"We went for a dinner with work colleagues.  The atmosphere is beautiful and lively and there is good people watching.  The wine list is very good.  The service was ok.  They were prompt with pouring wine but they didn't give an extra utensils to share the dishes (and I find it a little off putting when people are using the same fork to grab the food and sauces that they are putting in their mouth).  This was inconsistent with the posh atmosphere.  They also had to be prompted to explain which was the lamb, the chicken, the vegetarian dish etc and they seemed anxious to drop the dishes and jump away.  The food was good.  Not excellent.  Not a lot heat to any dish.  Small portions.  Admittedly my expectations must have been too high.  They weren't met.  I have much better Indian.",-1
3,Food was good but not amazing. Very hot day and the air conditioner had stopped working at 6 we arrived around 8:30 and it was to hot to relax. Water was needed to stop you from passing out and the staff were more than happy and to charge for the bottle of water even though the air conditioning was off. The bar below is amazing and will return to the bar. My suggestion is go on a cold day,-1
3,The food here was mediocre.   I have had high quality fusion and indian and this place was simply ok.  Had a number of the appetizers and nothing had the flavor or taste of San Francisco.   My main course was the fish which was ok too.  The ambiance is great but the food is less than the ambiance.,-1
2,"I had high expectations for this place.  The restaurant interior is beautiful, and I appreciate that they kept the Victorian library look and feel of the space.  
For the price point, I have to say that the food was less than stellar, and the portions were on the small side, requiring my group to order more and more.  There was nothing in particular that stood out for me in terms of any dishes that ""wowed"" me, other than the butter chicken.  However, I liken butter chicken to pizza.  Even bad pizza is still pretty good pizza.
Service was okay to below-average.  I was without a drink for quite some time, and had to constantly flag the wait staff down to put my order in.    
For your money and time, I would probably try other places out over the Cinnamon Club.  Not worth the time.",-1
5,A great restaurant that is owned by one of the amazing chefs Vivek Singh with his modern take on Indian dishes.  The restaurant is light and airy with its conservatory style window ceiling.  I also love the way the tables are dotted around the restaurant however  I do feel that tablecloths are now old hack and should be got rid off and replaced with nice marble or wooden tables. Thee price of the food is a tad expensive for the a la carte menu however if you go for a set menu via Bookatable approx. £30 for three courses I feel is much better as a main course on the a la carte menu is approx. £23 alone.  However I went for the a la carte menu as I had a voucher to use up and that was the terms to buy from the a la carte menu so for just a starter each and a main meal plus non alcoholic cocktail for us two it came to around £95. However unlike most celebrity / michellin stared chef restaurants I feel that the portions served here are much bigger than some.  I had the halibut with lemon sauce and lime rice and it was pure citrus heaven for me with a tad of back spice.  My husband had the beef with a spicy peppery coating and it was cooked to perfection (medium rare as requested).  The chocolate bomb was just lush and so tangy with the passionfruit that is in the bomb highly recommend and I love the touch of gold flake that was on top of the bomb.,1
5,"My husband booked a table here on my birthday. A very nice fine dining place. The first thing that I noticed was the huge library full of books. 
The food is itself an experience there! Exquisite and delicious menu.. I felt like tasting everything ;) :P
One of the places which I would recommend people to go.",1
4,"Great food with very unique flavors. It is definitely an expensive place as other reviews have pointed out, but you know that going in. As with many upscale restaurant, the portion size was pretty tiny. You definitely won't leave feeling stuffed even if you order an app, entree, and dessert. 
The restaurant itself is quite large and is housed in a old library, which made for a nice look and feel.",1
5,"It's not often a gal gets to travel to Westminster and dine among celebrities in a gorgeous former Victorian library. The decor was pristine, the service impeccable, and the food OMG, the food was Divine. I adore Asian cuisine and Indian food is at the very tippy top of that list. I have never been to India but it is to my understanding when you have Indian cuisine in the UK it is not much different. I have eaten at several Indian restaurants, but this was a very special invitation for our business partners, my husband and myself. The Chefs definitely put a precise modern spin on their dishes. This is not the ordinary potted masses of paneer, tikka masala and so on...this is fresh, organic free range and farm to table plating of the highest quality fish, meats, veg, and delightful desserts too. They have a selection of chutneys to pair to your plate as well. King prawns in mango sauce, Tandoori free range chicken, lamb in corn curry, Sea Bass in coconut ginger sauce served with lentils...are you drooling yet....a huge bar and drink selection too! We always have a superb crisp white wine and in this case Sauvignon Blanc to go with it. We highly suggest you treat yourselves to a lovely experience at the Cinnamon Club. We enjoyed it thoroughly and will gladly be back again.",1
3,"I'd say this is slightly overrated. I would give it 3.5 stars and for the price, would prefer Dishoom.
Flavor wise, the food was good, but it didn't exactly match the price tag. Unless you include the shaved gold that was added on top of our meat. 
Our service was also a little strange and left a lot of awkward moments between us and the staff member. Rather than providing guidance on the menu, the waiter kept insisting we get XYZ, which felt pushy and unresponsive to the table's taste/needs.",-1
5,"My husband and I went here for dinner with one of my husband's colleagues. The place has a very nice upscale feel to it, but people were dressed casually. No sneakers! The staff treats you as if you were in a fine dimimg establishment. There is a separate bar area and shelves and shelves of books. It is a library after all.
The food is delicious and the portions just right. It is a bit pricey, but the quality of the food reflects that. 
This was a wonderful dining experience and I hope to revisit this place if I ever get back to London.",1
5,"Writing this review a year later, as I still remember the jackfruit served 3 ways.  I'm now a convert!",1
5,Exceptional cod appetizer and lamb entree. The service was exceptional and the patrons were friendly (I ate alone). Best Indian good experience ever! Great bar downstairs plays Indian movies on a giant Sal screen behind the bar - nice ambiance. Rather modern feel.,1
3,"Many years ago, my dad told me I could get good Indian food for no more than £10 pp. Well suffice to say not here you can't. From previous experience I was expecting overpriced food, arrogant service and a somewhat standoffish greeting at the front desk. In the main I wasn't disappointed. The food however is very tasty, interesting flavours, so compliments to the chef and to 2 of the many waiters that served us.
My favourite dish was the livers, which were exquisite. 
Why did I come here again I hear you ask? Because my other half needed to tick a box. In fairness it's the wine that really bumps up the bill, so next time I might just stick to tap water!",-1
4,"What an cool and unusual restaurant, LOVE the library atmosphere of this restaurant.  We met a couple of friends in London and they took us to this place.  The food was more upscale and surely more elaborate than your usual Tikka masala.  Great wine selection and great dishes.  Duck breast is a must. Place gets really crowded so reservations is highly recommended.",1
5,Went here for my birthday during the week. It was a busy night for the restaurant. We were seated next to one of the bookshelves against the wall which was good. Started with a bottle of red Malbec which was very good. My starter was the Reshmi chicken kebab and my main was the Romney Marsh lamb with corn sauce and pilau rice. Both were melt in your mouth and the taste was flavoursome. I would definitely go back again.,1
5,"This was the best accidental find! It was Boxing Day and we were wandering around London when I needed to use the bathroom, so we decided to eat here. The food was excellent, but I definitely recommend saving room for dessert - the sorbet trio is a perfect complement to any meal.",1
5,"Amazing service, drinks and food. Loved every single dish severed, hands down my favorite fix menu experience thus far. Can't wait to come back, thanks for the awesome night!",1
5,Never been disappointed here. Just get the prix fixe menu and let them take care of you.,1
5,"Second time here this year, wow - definitely one of our favorites.  Modern and 'fine' takes on indian cuisine with just amazing results.  Nothing has disappointed.  This latest time had the tandoori pigeon starter, it was the star of the night.  Not just the meat, but the accompanying garnish flavors complemented so well I just wanted order three more.  Had the lamb saddle main, which was perfectly medium rare and one of the most tender lamb cuts I've ever had.  Also mentioned on the reservation that one of us had a shellfish allergy and didn't eat starch, the server came fully prepared and made solid recommendations and substitutions without even asking (including a different 'from the kitchen' tasting starter for me).  Only *extremely minor* suggestion would be to server the tea  in a different type of pot.  The nice glass pot provided no ability to remove the tea leaves, which left the water for 'second cup' seeping in the tea leaves while the first cup was being savored.  The 'second cup' was then a quite bitter.",1
1,"Cinnamon Club is a beautiful restaurant with sketchy service and zero to no accommodation for anyone with a food allergy. Our server told me that I could have okra. That's it. So I ordered okra (for my dinner main course). I had hoped to have something. Anything. Although I have food allergies, I can always find something to eat just about anywhere. I hate being the person who's difficult to serve, so I'm extremely flexible. But that did not matter at Cinnamon Club. When my okra arrived, it was clearly an appetizer portion--even though they knew it was all I could have. No effort to bulk up my plate or anything. No one made me feel welcome or as if the chef or staff hoped to do something...anything at all...to make my experience nice. What I had was okay. Sadly, my cocktail wasn't impressive either. We noticed sluggish service all around our table as well. Others had to ask for a waiter to be sent over so they could order. They were seated before we were. I was really looking forward to this meal, but I am leaving hungry and unimpressed.",-1
5,"refined take on Indian food. you won't find the typical fare, and that's okay with me.
a new staple each time I visit London. can't go wrong with the lunch set menu.
service is as outstanding as the food.",1
4,"Vegans: there are three things we can eat here, but each of them is really good. Starter involving potato, spinach, coriander; main course a spicy jackfruit curry, and the holy grail: delicious vegan naan! The ambience, service, and wine list are amazing. So if you're okay with the limited menu choices, you can have a great meal here with non-vegan friends.",1
2,"The food here is amazing but we were clearly punished by our service staff for having booked for eight people when only five turned up. They virtually neglected our table despite having purchased large dinners, sides, appetizers, and bottles of wine. It was nearly embarrassing to see our waiter make numerous stops at every other table even when it was clear nothing was needed while neglecting ours.  To make matters worse on the odd occasion he did stop he would apologize but gave no reason for his tardiness. So enjoy the food but be warned the staff behaves like they are above you.",-1
5,Spent the evening here for drinks and the tasting menu. It was an incredible experience and would highly recommend the tasting menu to anyone visiting for the first time. Chef is amazingly versatile and the courses are interesting and delicious.,1
4,"I dined here by myself but I still very much enjoyed my experience.  I had to wait a little while since I showed up without a reservation, but having a drink at the library bar turned out to be an excellent way to spend time while waiting for a table.  
The cuisine was like no Indian food I've had before, and I've had a lot of Indian food.  Since this place is more on the upscale side I expected the food to be more bland (for Indian food, that is), so I was pleasantly surprised to find that you still got the intense mix of flavors with every bite.  
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.  The atmosphere is nice, too.  Next time I'll make sure I have a companion.  :-)",1
5,"A terrific restaurant that virtually invented high-end Indian fusion for the London audience 11 years ago.
My wife and I tried the Tasting Menu (£75 per person £115 with paired wines).  I'll let the menu speak for itself:
1. Roasted plaice fillet with Bengali spiced crab
2. Tandoori breast of Anjou pigeon with chickpea chaat
3. Ground vegetable kebab
4. Baked wild African prawn with 'kadhai' spices
5. Khus and mint sorbet
7. Char-grilled halibut with Bengali 'dopyaza' sauce, ghee rice
8. Saddle of Cumbrian wild red deer with corn and millet kedgeree
9. Chocolate mousse with white chocolate and garam masala parfait
Coffee and petits fours
The setting is an elegant terrific former library, with a hip modernistic bar downstairs.
Table service was a bit mixed.  After the first 5 flawless courses, they cleared our sorbet and we waited a bit.  They then tried to serve our sorbet a second time.  They then tried to serve us another table's course, but finally got back on track.  A small gripe however, it was an awesome meal and they are friendly and seem to try hard to please.
The meal was just over 2.5 hours -- which was just fine by us.
We also ordered one of the 3 Cinnamon Club cookbooks by their celebrity chef and co-founder Vivek Singh, who was in the kitchen and was kind enough to sign one for us.",1
4,"The Cinnamon Club came highly recommended and I was looking forward to dine there. By chance we got a table the same day
We arrived early evening and were shown to our table immediately. We ordered drinks before the food and had to wait 20 mins getting served. The somewhat inattentive service however does not spoil the incredible food experience coming out of the kitchen. This was without any doubt one of the best asian/indian meals ever!",1
3,It used to be a great restaurant. Management changed and not the same anymore. Avoid on sundays since there are 3 main dishes only.,-1
1,"Extremely overrated Indian food that is neither here nor there ! Waste of time, money and the one star ! Stay home and look up an Indian recipe online - it'll be more fun,  satisfying and more Indian than you know.",-1
4,"Very good Indian, in a neat old Library in Westminster.  A little pricey, but that's because of the location.",1
4,Consistently good.  I am a regular and have enjoyed this place for many years.,1
3,"I really, really, really wanted to like the Cinnamon Club.
It's a great locale, set in the old Westminster Library, very art-deco-ish (if you like that kind of stuff), has an exclusive feel to it as you enter, but then things kind of progressively deflated as the evening wore on.
Let's start with the bar, where we had to wait 15-20m despite having reservations at 830pm and having arrived on time. People have gushed about the bar, but seriously, the room is a bit incongruous, the furniture mismatched, and the overall seating arrangement a bit weird. We ordered 2 martinez's (sp??)... however, which were truly excellently mixed. Chapeau to the bar tender.
We got seated, and I must say, the service for the most part was excellent. They moved us to a quiet corner, which, if you've been there, you know is difficult to achieve; the high ceilings reverberate, and the atmosphere gets pretty loud... which is great if you want to keep your conversations private.
Now on with the food:
For appetisers, we shared the:
Grilled Scottish king scallops with hot lentil chutney, smoked Devon crab puree (17£)
Hot yoghurt and chickpea soup with crisp pink aubergine steaks (£8)
Char-grilled Welsh lamb fillet with nutmeg, sweetbread bhaji and caper kachumber (£10)
Everything tasted delicious... except for the amount of money we were dishing out, I was expecting more bang for the buck, if you know what I mean. The scallops tasted amazing, but they were tiny! So great on the taste front, but really poor on the value for taste front. I know, I know, it's all about quality, not quantity... but I don't buy that BS. It's possible to have amazing quality with non military ration inspired amounts of food. This is just pure customer margin extraction.
I had ordered a bottle of NZ Syrah... which was great... except 5 different waiters kept trying to pour my partner for the evening a glass of wine, despite numerous requests not to do so. I don't particularly like 'servititis', and the overzealous servers at the Club do have a little bit of that going on....
The mains were even better (and the portions reasonably more adequate):
Chargrilled Halibut with Kashmiri fennel and ginger sauce (£25)
Tandoor wild Spencer Gulf king prawns with Goan curry sauce, pandan, and coconut rice (£27.50)
The halibut tasted amazing, and the 4, let's say 'princely' rather than 'king' prawns were out of this world. But, I kept thinking back to my time living in Mumbai, where we would go to the ITC Hotel near the International Airport, and gorge ourselves on fat, juicy, tandoori tiger prawns for less than 10$. It made the 7£ per prawn slightly more expensive that I was happy with. Again, call me a miser... but I can't escape my internal benchmarks.
For dessert, we had the 'Lime Cheesecake' and the 'Pudding, Pecan Nuts with Garam Masala ice cream'.
Forget the cheesecake, it's a lump of 'crème fraiche' mixed through with some lime rind or something. Boring and uneventful.... the pudding however is to die for. The combination with the garam masala ice cream is out of this world, with the slight hint of heat from the masala accentuating the depth of the chocolate (kind of making it like an Indian version of mole sauce)... and the ice cream cooling stuff off. Nice combo. Worth coming back just for dessert next time (will help not to break the bank ;).
All in all, 200£ for 2 people. 
Was it worth it ? No.
Would I do it again ? Only for dessert ;)
Was the food good ? Yes
Could I get as good quality somewhere else, minus some originality? Yes
Now, don't let that detract you from seeing for yourself what the fuss is about.",-1
5,"If your looking for fancy swanky upscale delicious Indian fusion heaven you have come to the right place. Situated in the Old Westminster Library converted into a large open dining room, it has this classic air of English meets London. 
Given a potato dumpling after ordering I knew we where in for a treat. The restaurant begin to fill up to capacity and the waiters who fix your napkin when you go to the bathroom no longer standing around trying to find something to do. I ordered the plantain kofta with beetroot chutney. Absolutely amazing. 
I am still full and it is the next day! I ended my meal with an over the top dark chocolate pudding served with masala ice cream which I could not finish but tried my best. 
This place is a utter treat. The bar downstairs does 2 for 1 drinks between 4-7pm weeknights.",1
4,"I'm not huge on Indian food, but the ambiance and tastes in Cinnamon kitchen show why it's a top notch restaurant in London! We came for lunch, which was not crowded at all. We booked through toptable and got a deal that included a cocktail, quite naughty for lunch time during a work day!
I won't repeat what everyone has said about the exceptional Westminster Library location and the great food (their flavoured mash is excellent!) but will say to be mindful of the price of their wines and sides as we nearly doubled our set menu price by having one glass of wine and one side each.",1
5,"A fabulous meal in a lovely environment. We went relatively early at 6.30pm so very empty and placed in the corner but by 7.30pm it was packed.
We were given a free morsel a lovely potato ball deepfried.
I had the scottish king scallops covered in baby squid stirfiry on a bed of spinach and cauliflower puree - amazing!!
I then had the welsh saddle of lamb served with keema sag and finally a warm chocolate mousse with white chocolate icecream, followed by coffee which came with petite fours. I would love to go back and might try there special offers next time. I also had their zombie cocktail which contains absynthe which was quite refreshing",1

5,"This is an Indian restaurant with a British twist. The executive chef is Vivek Singh.
The building itself is pretty impressive - the old Westminister library so think lots of book shelves that I am sure can tell a few tales!
The crowd is a mix of casual/dressy/business and MP's - from the nearby Houses of Parliament.
Food is very nice and original, think pigeon, quineoa, strawberries in your dinner all mixed with great Indian flavours and spices.
It can get a bit noisy due to the high ceilings.
Cocktails are fantastic. They have a lovely small library bar and then also a bar downstairs with Bollywood moives playing on the projector.
Recommend.",1
4,Absolutely delicious! I am not a huge Indian food fan normally but this is an amazing place. The atmosphere is interesting in an old library and it is perfect for a large group - we had 12 people.,1
5,"Really fantastic upmarket indian food, set in the Old Westminster Library. Totally wonderful and grand-feeling dining.
We took some friends from New York here for dinner, and all four of us loved the food. I think my favourite thing about the meal was the dessert, though! It was a really interesting combination of three different Indian-flavour-inspired things. Dessert is not a course I normally associate with Indian food, but my mind was changed after coming here.
Basically, the standard of the food, quality of the service and all-round pleasant-ness of the experience is equal to the Cinnamon Club's prices. And that's always a good thing to find.",1
5,One of my favorites. The atmosphere is very sophisticated but not stuffy. The wines are unique. The waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly. I have enjoyed this restaurant on several occasions and never been served a bad meal. It is appropriate for small groups or on a special occasion. The bar is quaint and warm. Definitely must go!,1
3,Good food but a bit pricey.  They take indian food from ethnic to upscale fairly well.  I enjoyed the club feel bar - nice for a low key drink before dinner.,-1
4,"Beautiful décor.  It is like an old library.  
The bar downstairs is very posh.
The service was meh.
I got the prawns, which were amazing.  Suzanne got the halibut which was pretty good.
It ended up being close to $300 USD, so heads up!",1
4,"I'd start by saying that the food quality is absolutely superb, especially the king prawn dish and the black lentils. It's pretty pricey though and a little bit old school (it's not got the atmosphere of Dishoom) however it's great food, decent service and a lovely setting - arrive early and have a drink in the library bar!",1
4,"There are times only a curry will do.
Those times when you're hung over and you want to create a commotion in your mouth. To purge your body through fiery sweat of all the ills inside.
To comfort and sooth your aching bones with the magical lubricant that is ghee.
To gorge yourself silly with mad flavours and three too many side dishes. And poppadums.
Warning. The Cinnamon Club isn't for those times.
There's no gorging here. No poppadums either. No flock wallpaper or piped music. No lurid picture of a waterfall where the water moves magically. The menus aren't laminated and the sauces aren't the colour of nuclear fusion. Personally I'm a sucker for all that stuff you get at your local curry house. 
But I'm also a sucker for everything the Cinnamon Club has to offer.
The missus and I had been once before, about 10 years ago, and loved it. But we never find ourselves in Victoria much, hence the gap.
Well, after a morning at Westminster Abbey, we thought it was time to go back, so we strolled down.
First off, the building. A grand place. An old library with plenty of space, lots of crisp linen and sparkling glass. The welcome is warm but at the same time formal enough for you to know you're coming to dine, not gorge.
Next the menu. A la cart dishes to make the mouth water and the eyes water too when you see the price. No vindaloo, no CTM (the most popular dish in the country so we're told). We plumped for the set lunch menu which had plenty of choice.
To start we had a mackerel fillet which had a beautifully balanced spice rub on it before being delicately steamed and fried (I think). Delicate flavours every one. Personally I prefer a well burnished skin on my mackerel but this would have defeated the point of the dish. It was accompanied by a mustard sauce which worked ever so well. It complimented the fish rather than overpowering it. The other starter was tender pieces of chicken, again beautifully spiced and served with a yoghurt that set if off well. It was close to tandoori chicken but simply more delicate in colour and flavour and cooking.
My main was a lamb curry (can't remember the exact description) which came as two pieces of lamb with a thick creamy red sauce around it. The sauce was soaked up by beautifully done rice. It was fantastic. The missus's main was two plaice fillets, again rubbed with a beautiful blend of spices, cooked to perfection. The salad it came with I didn't particularly care for, it was a runner bean and coconut thing. I'm just not a great fan of runner bean. It was expertly cooked and presented though. 
I can honestly say the plaice was sensational. So light and fluffy but with this pronounced spice which didn't mask the natural flavour of the fish. Memorable.
Not that we needed a pudding afterwards but seeing as it was only £2 extra to have one, then why not?
Basil Panna Cotta with a ginger and date crumble is what came out. Great texture, robust basil flavour, a hint of the east with the ginger. A lovely finish.
The thing about this place is that you eat an Indian here completely differently to how you eat one normally. we found ourselves savouring every mouthful, combining different flavours thoughtfully and really appreciating all that was happening on our excited tongues. Beautifully balanced is the best I can describe it. Thoughtful cooking which leads to thoughtful eating. Makes a change for a crammer like me.
Service was warm, friendly and helpful, especially with me enquiring after every dish EXACTLY what went into it. Surroundings ever so swish. Not the place for a proper rave up certainly. It's quite reserved and cool, but very relaxing and you really find yourself focussing on the food.
And for £24 for three courses, well I think that's the best bargain I've come across in a long while. A lovely meal in every respect but mostly a real treat for the taste buds. A reminder if one was ever needed that Indian food is simply the king of all  cuisines. Je suis desole Frenchies.",1
4,"Great food, tremendous combination of different tastes on every dish we got! Service could have been better.",1
5,"This place came highly recommended to us.  Now I know why!
First, the location is beautiful, very close to westminster abbey
The library bar was one of the most subtle cool venues ever for a bar.  The drink menu has some very creative martinis.
The minute you walk in here, you've pretty much decided to splurge -- so we made it even more ridiculous by doing the 7 course fixed menu, since it had so many interesting items on it.
The food was exquisite!  Not exactly Indian, more Indian-inspired.  I don't think deer with curry is a common dish in India! :)  We struggled to keep up with all the wine that is paired with the meal.
A word of caution -- at 250GBP for the meal (over 400 USD), this place is pricey!   But the amazing dining area, unique food, and the all-around experience made it worth it.",1
5,"Probably the best example of how to handle a customer problem that I have ever come across. My wife and I went there a few weeks ago on a night when everything was going wrong for them, our main courses arrived before the starters, and naturally I was not happy; however, they got back to me and offered us a free meal on the house, which I was delighted to take up.
We have just enjoyed a wonderful meal, some of the best and most original Indian food that we have ever enjoyed - not your normal curries but something on a totally different level.
It is sophisticated and interesting food, perfectly cooked and served in a thoroughly professional manner. This place sets standards that few Indian restaurants could compete with, and we have eaten at Benares, Tamarind and Trishna, all of which have gained a Michelin star, I am amazed that Cinnamon Club doesn't have one.",1
1,"Stood next to hotel concierge while he talked with Cinnamon Club and obtained confirmed reservations.  Later that evening, the restaurant called the concierge to state that they had no availability.  How can you confirm a reservation and then unconfirm it?  The restaurant manager had no explanation when asked.",-1
5,"I got an email about a special 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings that they were having.  My partner, being English, loves Indian food (especially curry), and I, having been to India, also love Indian food (perhaps more than English curry, but that can be our little secret).  We are also huge fans of wine, and we often find ourselves in a wine rut at home only purchasing the same wines over and over again.  Especially white wines.  Our white wine purchases are pretty much either New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc or the white wine from Chapel Down.  We're a bit more diverse in our red wine purchases, but living in California for ages, we're still developing our tastes for European wines.  For these two reasons, we jumped at the chance to have some Indian food with some European wines!
When we got there, they were handing out either cinnamon bellinis or white port with tonic.  I definitely preferred the bellini, as tonic to me always makes me feel like I should be drinking gin, but since I wasn't, the taste just made it taste strange.  
Needless to say, we both had a great evening.  The wine was tasty, and there was plenty of it.  The food paired phenomenally with the wine.  My favorite course was probably the mutton.  It was quite smoky and delicious.  My partner liked the plaice with crab.  However, all the courses were great, including the chicken and the duck.  I really enjoyed the dessert as well, a chocolate tart with cumin. 
We were both fairly plied with wine when we left, and we had a very enjoyable evening.  It's definitely on our list of places to go back to.  I enjoyed it so much that I kind of want the cookbook.",1
5,"A remarkable culinary journey that is unrivaled in Indian cuisine! Vivek Singh's remarkable interpretation of Indian cooking is presented with great flair at this Westminster converted library. The library bar is a quiet place to meet colleagues before retiring to the dining room for the grand meal. The downstairs bar has a little more energy for night life.
The dining room includes shelves of books denoting the building's prior life. Waiting service is extremely well appointed. Make sure to ask the sommelier for recommendations from the extensive wine list. Your wine and water glasses will never reach empty at the Cinnamon Club! 
But enough about the atmosphere! The reason you go to CC is for the marvelous menu created by Executive Chef Vivek Singh. There was not a single dish among those I tasted from the 5 diners that I considered even mildly lacking in flavor. Dish after dish was replete with flavor and inspiration. If you have 3 hours to spare, I would recommend the 8 course tasting menu (with optional wine pairings). If not, then make sure to try one of the great appetizers, including: roasted plaice & crab, carpaccio of salmon, char-grilled Welsh lamb fillet and the tasting of Bombay street food.
For the entree, Singh's roast saddle of ""Oisin"" red deer is not to be missed! The hot & sweet prawns and the Hyderabadi lamb are also quite desirable. Order a side of garlic naan and masala mashed potatoes! 
For dessert, the kulfi is my personal favorite but every dish I tasted was more than delicious!
This will always be a ""must-visit"" for me when in London. Well done Chef Singh!!!",1
5,"It's simply the best Indian restaurant in London. The environment is beautiful, service is impeccable , cuisine is excellent, cocktails from the bar are simply perfect. 
As well as every beautiful thing even this one has its price. Booking is practically a must. The restaurant is set in the historic Grade II listed former Westminster Library. The food is the best Indian cuisine can provide in the world. Maybe that evening we may have overstepped with bread (as italians used) so as to spend about forty pounds just for that (about 12 Paratha). The elegant colonial atmosphere and great food make it a must, at least once in their lifetime. Dinner for three people, without wine, only sparkling water, over 300 pounds. But it was well worth it. I've been there for dinner, I hope one day to come back for other meals and to be able to taste it from breakfast to lunch, to dinner too. I strongly recommend it.",1
4,"The best posh indian food i've tasted.....but be warned, the heat is as high as the price.  
Went here for a friends birthday who has nuclear taste buds and she had what was called the bollywood burner - we understand now that its no longer the hotest dish in the world....think it maybe around number 3 now (well thats what the tall dark and handsome guy said that offered to get me a chiili to try - maybe his plan was to try and cause me a heartatack then save my life than I would give an even bigger tip!!!).  Anyhows, friend did actualy sign the contract to eat this meal and she did find it too hot, but to everyones dissapointment working there who kept checking on us she didnt break into a sweat, although I must say they were never intrusive and i enjoy my glass being topped up every time i take a sip
Wine list is fair, but don't expect many bottles to be under the 50 quid mark, actually probably more 100.  The non nuclear food is just as good and has an extremly tasteful zing to it
Its a posh place without the pretendance....everyone working there is attentive, but not intrusive, I would say that its posh but not old school posh and all are welcome, although you would fit in better if you wore a suit and your more 40 upwards (even in the funky looking downstairs bar)...basically for established people that can easily spend a couple hundread on dinner
To sum up;
The food was great, people working there really attentive and know how to provide a service.  The only down side (well apart from the fact someone else wasnt paying for me) was the wait for the wine...which we werre later infomed that they had to go to the cellar to fetch, which nearly caused me a mini heart attack as i thought I might have missed a 0 of the price tag
well worth a visit, although unfortunately for us non westminster suit types its going to have to be a special occassion",1
5,"I'd been told great things about this restaurant so I was expecting a lot. I went here with my partner, my mum and sister and my cousin who's like a brother, so the food needed to match the company. We ordered starters naturally. I went for the vegetarian route and had tandoori broccoli. The main was a chicken curry of sorts. Both were excellent. Where everything excelled was in the quality of the side dishes. Every one of them so delicious I could have had them as mains. I didn't have one mouthful that I didn't like throughout the whole meal. Even the naan bread was amazing. For dessert I had the Indian equivalent of a creme anglaise tart, and wow was it good. I almost ejaculated whilst eating it. The bill was expectedly eye watering and it's definitely a place for extra special occasions, unless of course you're Tamara Ecclestone.",1
4,"Before you go here phone the bank manager and ask for his permission. Also let him know that your card hasn't been cloned or borrowed in answer to that recurring shonky email request. 
Put simply, Cinnamon Club is for high rollers, wannabe ballers and shot callers.
I remember the first time i ever came here: it was like foreplay for the tongue. 
I've 'done' lunch here a few times over the years, sometimes on the largesse of others at on occasion by myself and what can i say?
Every time I go here the taste of the food refuses to budge from my palette for days. It's like being upgraded to First Class on a plane. You know, you go left instead of right and you start your trip off with a bang.  Every other flight experience thereafter is a pale imitation.
 
Sprinkle in a few celebs and politicians - if you like that sort of thing - and you'll be in the zeitgeist. Let's put it this way, if you think you're sitting next to someone famous then you probably are. It's that kind of place.
The sumptuous ambience takes civility up a notch. Concierge service at the front door, makes you feel like a true VIP the moment you breach the threshold. Then again, maybe they just liked my tailored suit. Sit down, ruffle an eyebrow and you'll have service before the word forms on your lips. Very attentive, very cute. 
But what of the food?
It ain't cheap, but then again given its location, did you really expect that to be the case?
If your bank manager will let you, depart from the set menu. 
Try to explain to him how good the food is. Though it'll be like trying to describe colour to a blind man, it's worth the effort but ultimately futile.
At first glance the food doesn't look like much - shrimp on a stick, small pieces of weirdly shaped meat etc - and in truth the portions appear stingy but here, the ethos is clearly less is more. In their defence, i guess it's all about the ever-changing menu.
This is a definite once a year treat for restricted budgets or if you're a bonus heavy banker-type: a light, regular snack. Still if you want to live like there's no tomorrow go ahead and throw financial caution to your stomach. The experience promises not to disappoint. Just don't expect to come away to come away any wealthier or less hungry than when you stepped in.
I won't even get you started on the wine list as it'll add a minimum of 20% to your bill by my calculations...",1
3,"Indian-influenced fine dining in Old Westminster Library, Intriguing enough! 
A large business group looking for a nice place to eat, some of us wanted Indian food, others don't really eat Indian food, so this place seemed to be a very happy compromise -- haute cuisine with a hint of Indian flavour, exquisite presentation, and gracious service. Not to mention the uniquely interesting location and interior decoration that other Yelpers have already commented on. 
The food is quite tasty, albeit not authentic (the restaurant website uses the description ""Beyond Authentic""). Amongst the dishes enjoyed by our group, there were tandoori breast of Anjou squab pigeon, skate wing, sea bass in goan curry sauce, Hyderabadi style lamb. The menu is not extensive but it changes frequently, if not daily, so the desired outcome is that you will always find something interesting enough to try. 
The price is quite reasonable for this type of establishment and in this area of London, especially if you can get there during the time that set menu is being offered (2 courses for £19 or 3 courses for £22). 
All in all, a nice place to go to for its location/ambience/service and Indian-influenced fine dining. Obviously don't go there if you are looking for hardcore authentic Indian food.",-1
4,"I had wanted to try this place for awhile - Indian fine dining in a British Library! C'mon it's appealing and intriguing. So I lucked out when I was invited to a Private Dining event at this restaurant by a friend.
This is a special occasion type of place, not your casual average curry house! Don't go here expecting chicken tikka masala, Balti or Pillau - this is Indian Fusion at its best!
The room looked beautiful, the service was friendly but unobtrusive and the food was excellent. The interior is elegant, warm and Old-world chic.
I enjoyed a good meal, however did find it a bit overpriced -good thing I didn't have to pay for it.
Edit: If you are feeling adventurous try the deer, rabbit or pheasant. Othwise the chicken, prawns and Wagyu Beef are pretty good!",1
4,"I usually avoid high end Indian restaurants (preferring more ordinary fare), but this was an exception.   Tasting menu and premium wine pairing.   All of the dishes were excellent, with sea bass being a narrow winner. Wines were also excellent, albeit somewhat obscure.  Nice room with no bad tables.  No missteps.",1
3,"My friend was sad. I decided to take her out to dinner to cheer her up. Problem was, I was also broke. But no matter - there was a great deal at Pizza Express. 
Unfortunately, my friend (of expensive taste and one never to miss out on an opportunity for free food) had already booked us into the Cinnamon Club. 'Don't worry,' she said, 'I've got a TopTable special!'. 
In order to qualify for this (2 courses with Bellini for £19 or 3 courses for £22) we had to be seated by 6.30. As I don't finish work until 6pm in North London, I duly arrived at 6.40, a giant ball of sweatiness and immediately felt intimidated by my 'rah' surroundings. It didn't help that as I sat down with my friend her first words were 'Ha! you look like a nurse.'

The surroundings are beautiful - wood-panelled walls, a balcony dining area and crisp white table cloths. And quiet... Admittedly it was fairly early and therefore not too busy but you did feel awkward speaking at anything above a hushed whisper. 
Anyway, onto the important bit - the food! The Set Menu was limited - 3 choices for Starter, 3 for Main and 3 for pud. And it was a different Set Menu on their website from which I'd dribbled over earlier that day. I ordered the Grilled Plaice and Lamb Chops. Grilled Plaice was delicious, definitely more so than my friend's 'M&S' style tandoori chicken chunks. The Lamb chop was good although the portion was decidedly too little! My friend had the mullet which looked and tasted divine. The Bellini was most exquisite - it tasted of spice and exoticness.  I could have easily made my way through a pitcher. 
My only alarming moment was when the waiter snuck up on me until his face was pretty much 3 inches from mine and asked 'DESSERT?'. I almost punched him. 
All in all, the food was pretty tasty if a little on the small side, the atmosphere was rather hushed, and it was pretty expensive, even with our TopTable offer. An additional glass of wine and side dish bumped up our bill by £20. I'd go again, just as long as someone else was paying! For me, it's def a special occasion visit.",-1
3,"Hmmm...
 My experience of the Cinnamon Club is rather different from most of those here, so I'll get straight to the point!
 The interior is indeed impressive, having once been a library, this two-storey room does provide a unique ambience.
 The food is Anglo-Indian in true fusion style, and there's no doubt that you can get some rich and unique flavours. Whether you actually like something like Massala Mash will be up to you - expect the innovative rather than classic Indian cooking. Personally, I find the offerings a bit hit and miss, and the vegetarian selection disappointing for an Indian restaurant. Some dishes really are very good, but others rather less so. The wine list is very good indeed, at a price.
 The price: I've not tried the £22 early-bird menu, which sounds like a very good deal, and probably the best way to sample the food. If you go a la carte, expect to pay £60 a head or more - plus service. Go for an above-average bottle of wine and I'd budget on £75 a head.
 And that is my main gripe. For this amount of money, I have not been impressed with the quality of service. On my last visit, my starter arrived before I had finished my (actually rather nice) 'free' appetiser, which was unceremoniously whisked away before I had finished it, and without being asked. I found this absolutely astonishing. And the waiters seemed a little sniffy throughout - again not what I expect for this amount of money (or for any amount of money, actually).
 So, good marks for the food and surroundings, but three overall taking into account value for money and service.",-1
2,"preparation//
my friend and i decided to check out this restaurant because of its honorable mention in my 1001 destinations book
tucked away in an alley...almost like an exclusive member's only entrance
so if it's your first time, be sure you have a smartphone so you can find this place easily
my friend and i walked in without a reservation and were seated immediately! yay!
ambiance//*****
wow how luxurious!  from the members' only entrance to the foyer and then into the dining area
there's a sort of quiet elegance to the place...*think* lawry's where you're surrounded by other tables, yet given privacy to engage in your own conversation
service//****
we were seated immediately after a long day of running around and catching a musical so this was a welcome end
we had a fairly attentive server that made recommendations and periodically checked with us on the refill of our drinks
food//**
they had interesting fusion dishes
i'm not sure if it was because of the overwhelmingly high expectations for yummy indian food, but i've had equally good indian cuisine in asia for a much more affordable price especially when the portions are considered
~*~
as far as upscale indian dining experiences go, this is probably as good as it gets! however, as a foodie, and price vs. taste...i'd consider this a bit out of a splurge!",-1
3,"WHITE PLATE FOOD!!! The taste of the food was great - so no problem there but it was pricey though...and I left hungry.
I am not a stranger to fine dining (and before you ask nooooo I don't have a chip on my shoulder) but the atmosphere was far too quiet and ultimately I could not shake the feeling that this place too stuffy for its own good.  Sorry guys it just didn't work for me.
Everyone else seemed to like it though....so maybe I was having a bad day...or maybe I wasn't...",-1
4,"Beautiful setting, delicate and non-mainstream Indian menu, attentive service - at a price.",1
5,"First, you need to know that this is one of the stupid-expensive London places.  Dinner for two is going to get you over 200--maybe well over depending on what you do about drinks and wine and tasting menus and such--without trying very hard.  So be warned!
But...I never regret the price afterwards.  (Well, maybe for a moment when the credit card bill comes.)  Cinnamon Club is fab and is worth the splurge.
The room is elegant (and the downstairs bar very swanky).  There tend to be a lot of well-dressed, moneyed folks around, from business people out spending their firms' dough (that still happens even in 2009!), to the older guy impressing the youngish girl, to the couple on the splurge, to the hens dumping their husbands for the night (you'll get the bill later, honey).  A few underdressed people stand out, and not in a good way...
The food is good and interesting.  Graduate school from the typical curry shop, this is elegant cuisine.  This visit I had a rabbit appetizer that was the perfect amount of spicy--my mouth tingled but was not lit up so much I couldn't taste beyond the heat.  All sorts of interesting depths of flavors.  My main course was venison in pickling herbs that was masterful (it was a cold, wet, wintery London night and game sounded great to me).  Everything went well with a bottle of New Zealand Pinot Noir (great wine list too).
Then a walk back to the hotel passing by Westminster Abbey and Big Ben at night, a great way to end the evening.
Cinnamon Club is worth budgeting for, seriously!",1
5,"Went there for a lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant was very quiet.
Service was fine without being exceptional, no complaints, job was done.
Food was magnificent. I wasn't expecting amazing rich flavour at indian haute cuisine but there was never any taste lacking in any of the dishes on the tasting menu. I highly recommend getting that as it was a great experience.
For indian fine dining one cannot go wrong here but if you want your quick chicken tikka masala then this is not the place.",1
4,"Loved this place...Excellent cocktails, great appetizers and amazing entrees.  This is truly a modern take on high level Indian cuisine.  Our waitress was a ""Low Talker"" and easily derailed BUT pleasant.",1
5,Great food at reasonable prices. I have tried many items from the menu and I can guarantee that everything is amazing and freshly prepared. The online booking is a really nice option and I always get my table without waiting too long.,1
4,Quite swish and a great clientele.  Portions are a little small for my liking but this can be a see and be seen kind of place.  Excellent wine with fantastic service.,1
4,"I have been meaning to go here for ages but it has always been one of those restaurants that I didn't want to pay for myself. 
I finally had an excuse to go during London Restaurant Week (which peversely lasts for two weeks) as they offered a set menu.  I enjoyed the meal enough that I plan to go to the Cinnamon Kitchen in the City sometime soon.
The building is a beautiful old converted public library which has a great leather bound bar and good dining room on the ground floor. The bar in the basement is a definite miss and is more suited to Tooting or Norbury than Westminster.
The food was better than I was expecting. The salmon starter was excellent. The duck main was enjoyable and the pudding was good (especially for an Indian restaurant where it is not exactly a forte of the cuisine).
As everyone says it is Westminster politico heavy but it makes interesting people watching.",1
3,"For celebrity-spotting you go to Nobu, but for politician-spotting you go to the Cinnamon Club - Westminster's top-choice for power lunches and after-debate drinks. I GUARANTEE you that if you get lunch here mid-week you'll see at least one cabinet minister. After all, Cinnamon Club is sandwiched between ministries and it's much more patriotic to be seen eating Indian food than French or Japanese. Such is our perverted world.
You dine in a beautiful old hall lined two-floors high with books on all walls. The lighting is good and it's real excellent white tablecloth service through and through (as you'd expect from the high prices). It's worth also visiting the dungeon-like basement which has a small but stylish cocktail lounge. 
So far, so good. But what of the food? Almost a decade ago Michelin made it the world's first Indian starred restaurant and Gordon Ramsay isn't shy at telling everyone how much he loves the cuisine here, but I found it underwhelming. My lamb dish lacked the sucker-punch I expected of sub-continent cooking and the mouthfuls I filched from my lunchmates solidified my thoughts... if you come in here thinking of the rich flavours and tastes of Indian food you'll only be disappointed, if you come in here having spent the last month dining on the bland subtleties of French food you'll love it.",-1
3,"I'd have to go back and try the menu a la carte, but the tasting menu was decent if uninspiring. 
The salmon tandoori, beetroot and plantain thingy, stir fry of shrimp, and breast of squab (the first 4 of 8 dishes) were very tasty, but the remaining dishes were fairy non-descript. I was particularly looking forward to the venison but the flavor of the meat was completely disguised by the strength of the accompanying curry (which was delicious by itself but I wanna taste deer!).
The service gets a star, they waiters were superlative, but the food gets an unenthusiastic thumbs up, at least until I can go back and try the rabbit tikka and some of the other a la carte dishes.",-1
5,"What can I say that hasn't already been said in all the thorough reviews before mine? Well ... how about this? The morning menu here is on par with sister restaurant, Cinnamon Kitchen (
londonist.com/2009/07/re…
) . The uttapam (south Indian rice pancake with onions, green chilli tomato and peppers served with coconut chutney and lentil broth) is an especially delicious way to spend £8. The flavourful and spicy Bombay scrabbled eggs are pretty rockin' too. 
Gorgeous setting for a gorgeous menu.",1
5,"You've got to try this place just for the decor. An old library put to excellent use. If you have the cash in the bank you should
Try the food too",1
4,"what a find!  we rarely venture into that area and wouldn't have found it without a friend's introduction.  reservations are a must and days in advance as i'm told that politicians and diplomats fancy the restaurant due to location.
ambiance is wonderful with the warm lights and books.  the menu was creative but kept depth in flavor.  i'm not sure what kind of peppers or chilis they use but i found it remarkable how the spicy-hottness intensified.
service was ok...we've had better at that calibar of a restaurant but it'll be the food that keeps me going back.  we've had ""posh Indian food"" before but this converted library is definitely noteworthy.",1
4,"My husband and I were lucky emough to visit this restaurant yesterday for a meal. It was a great experience although I wouldn't say the food matched the huge price tags! We started with (me) Breast of Partridge in pickling spices it was a little over cooked and tough to eat but still a wonderful taste to it and gorgeously presented. Husband had the plaice fillets with spiced crab which he really enjoyed. For main course I had the sea bass with chickpeas and green mango, wouldn't go mad about it but it was again beautifully presented. Husband had the saddle of deer in sesame and Tamarind sauce a little tough in parts but he thoroughly enjoyed it and the little bit I forced him to let me try was really tasty lol. The desserts were AMAZING!! I had the warm chocolate mousse with white chocolate icecream.. perfect and a chocoholics dream! My husband had the lemon tart with iced lemon cream and loved every mouthful! We were brought a THIRD dessert as a treat for our anniversary to share complements of the restaurant.. it was some kind of kittle sponge with a toffee type sauce and cinnamon ice cream.. very yummy AND a thin slab of dark chocolate with 'Happy Anniversary' piped on to it.. a really lovely touch and welcome suprise! 
The service was fantastic, every member of staff so friendly and helpful without being intrusive. The surroundings are beautiful, it's an amazing old building. A lovely place to go (if you can afford it!) for a special treat.",1
4,"Thoroughly delicious refined modern indian food. Great value if you manage to pick up some of the special offers on the net, although it's still a bit dear for a weekly outing.
Eating in a beautiful wood-lined library is a lovely twist. Don't be fooled by the very proper-looking interior, the staff are absolutely fantastic  friendly and with just the right amount of service. It's not far from the Houses of Parliament, which is why I thought it was a great place to bring someone who's over in London on their travels. That's what I did, and my friend was chuffed to see Big Ben at night after our sumptuous shared banquet.
My recommendation would be the mystifyingly spicy plaintain dumplings with beetroot chutney. The bread basket is also pretty sensational. Only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is that the desserts aren't in the same level as the frankly knockout modern indian cuisine.
Dinner: around £32 per head for 3 courses (with special offers)
Would suit: small groups, couples, foodies with an eye for ambience",1
5,"The Cinnamon Club was fantastic, it was one of the most interesting and well done meals I've had in a very long time. 
I would say that Indian inspired is a good term for the cuisine, it's not standard Indian food by any means. 
Everything we had was perfectly cooked and the sauces they made had incredibly depth and flavor. The yellow curry I had with halibut was unbelievably rich and complex. Still thinking about it. 
The desserts were especially fun as well. Very unique spices and flavors. 
Definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to have a fantastic dinner in London (and has some coin to spend).",1
1,"I've never been called to action to post before, but I was so taken aback by tonight's dinner that I must. I have never been treated so poorly and and with Such such disrespect! I went with friends to the cinnamon club for a fun evening away. As a host I was hoping to treat my company to a great dinner. I left midway through the meal to meet with the manager to speak about paying for the dinner as a good host. I was told that there was a man in my company and he was the host and he would make the decision! I try to explain that I was the host, and that I would be paying for it and do not want my my guess to see me pay for it. He abruptly turned away and walked away. I have never ever ever been so disrespected in my life. I truly feel that this was a slight and as later proves he walks the bill personally over to the only man in our group and placed it in his hands. I was so embarrassed as the man we were with then felt he must pay for everyone. It was truly an embarrassment and I am ashamed. I will never go here again.",-1
4,"Fixed priced lunch was a little expensive, 22 £, but excellent. The room is abuzz with business and government types, white table cloth, excellent service.",1
4,"Came here Saturday night. Really lovely building - the old Westminster Library, and yet it manages to convey a feel of being light, airy and elegant. The menu is fine for omnivores, but is definitely sparse when it comes to vegetarians. The waiter suggested a main dish for one of our party which was off-menu, and it was insubstantial and very disappointing. In the end both vegetarians in our group had the set menu which comprised a 'Bengali vegetable chop' (very good) and 'Assamese vegetable dumplings' (delicious). The fried courgette flower was also pronounced to be impressive. The meat eaters enjoyed the grilled scallops and crab paste starter which was excellent, and the Tandoori Gulf king prawns were highly praised. I had the Calfreal black leg chicken which was really very good. What I liked most about the food here was not only its consistency across the board (except the off menu dish), but also the subtlety of the flavours. Very few elements were very spicy (and as an Indian I tend to put chilli on everything), and this feast taught me just how clever and creative a chef could be with spices. Loved it. One of the best Indian meals ever and I shall return.",1
4,"Indian cuisine at its best.Friendly staff, knowledgeable and helpful but not overbearing.I haven't had many chances to taste Indian food before, so thought I'll give it a go in a restaurant that was recommended by a friend, it was lovely, an experience that I will repeat soon!",1
5,had a 3 course meal which was beautifully presented and tasted wonderful the staff was always come to make sure you were enjoying your meal. although it is pricey I would love to go again,1
4,"If there are generally acknowledged to be two kinds of cinnamon -- the legitimate kind, cinnamomum verum, and its poor relative, 'bastard' cassia from Saigon -- then this must surely be a third: cinnamomum colonium, the rich affable uncle dispensing fat cigars and expensively-wrappered bonbons from Bombay. The Cinnamon Club -- whose proximity to the House of Commons makes it a favourite haunt of power-victualling MPs (we spotted a few ourselves, mostly of the affable uncle variety; those aspiring politicians of a lean and hungry look being, we surmised, still in the office) -- is wood-panelled, high-ceilinged, leather-seated and altogether distinctly colonial in ambience. Indeed, the Club's chic new City-branch sister restaurant, Cinnamon Kitchen, has taken up residence - appropriately or inappropriately, depending which way you look at it - in the old spice warehouses of the East India Company. As political correctness goes, the Old Westminster Library -- since 2001 the setting for restaurateur Iqbal Wahhab's original vision of Indian fine dining -- seems positively tame by comparison.
If the Cinnamon Club courts the colonial aesthetic, its chef takes up the cudgels against an equally familiar Anglo-Indian institution: the curry-house. Ringing the changes on the apocryphal origins of chicken tikka masala -- one man and a can of tomato soup. Don't ask. -- Indian cuisine is alchemized (or, as detractors will have it, ""Frenchified"") in Vivek Singh's kitchen by the use of haute cuisine cooking techniques. Leaving aside the slightly dubious semantics of Singh's claim for a menu ""beyond authenticity,"" the point is: it works. As I hope to show. 
Once seated, watered, and titillated by the chef's amuse-gueule, a Lilliputian basket of gorgeously spicy tamarind in a polenta shell (solid enough, gratifyingly, to eat rather than to inhale), we ordered the roast saddle of 'Oisin' red deer, mouth-wateringly tender and seared to ruby in the French manner for an eye-watering £32. (Yes, it was worth it.). Having skipped a starter, we over-compensated on side-dishes. The masala mashed potatoes (£3) were coarsely mashed, Indian-style, and would have tasted far nicer had I known that while eating them (note to palate: for ""lumpy"", read ""authentic""). Meanwhile, the mushroom and spinach stir-fry (£5) was heaven in a few fleshy mouthfuls, belying its rather pedestrian description with funghi so lusty in flavour as to make even the laying on of spinach-strands feel one indulgence too far. As for the selection of breads (£6): suffice it to say that if roti, paratha and naan sound like characters from an Indian fairy-tale, show me the multi-grained, organic fairy-tale hot from the griddle and stuffed with delicately saffroned potato chunks -- and I just might credit the analogy. 
Our waiters -- flawless throughout -- having tactfully decamped while we digested the hefty bill (I blame  the red deer), we had ample time to up-end our wine bottle (a two-year old Chilean pinot noir, excellent value at £34) and, finding it obdurately empty, to talk ourselves into a cocktail in one of the Club's two award-winning lounge bars. My vote was for the Library Bar, the literature scholar in me having found something naggingly ignoble in the supplanting of Westminster's shrine of learning by Westminster's best restaurant. (I sense objections. Yes, I /did/ just compare a fairy-tale with a hot chapatti, and find the fairy-tale wanting. But I didn't mean it.) Disappointingly few tomes remain in the main restaurant space, most relegated to the upper gallery or to the bar in the former Reading Room -- pure 'Club', not a whiff of cinnamon -- which, on peering in after dinner, was as empty as our bottle of pinot noir. It would, of course, be unfair to attribute the apparent unpopularity of the Library Bar to the quality of its reading material on the grounds of just one observed title (which, for reasons of copyright, and a bad memory, I paraphrase as ""A Compendious History of Coal-Mining"".)
The Club's ultra-modern second bar (downstairs) had fared better, racking up an impressively non-zero clientele of mainly (we thought) pre-dinner drinkers. The not-especially-welcome presence of a large, sports-broadcasting projection screen (the bar moonlights as a bijou Bollywood movie theatre; unfortunately, this wasn't one of those nights) was more than compensated for by the exuberant Asian-inspired cocktail menu. 'Fool's Gold', among the Club's signature cocktails, and chosen for the sheer hedonism of its ingredients (I'm a sucker for edible gold leaf) offers, in fact, much more than novelty value and cute gold twinkles. A faintly glowing ochre in hue, it's complex and saffron-smooth, with a trace of cardamom that delivers -- thankfully -- less a kick than a discreet tap on the shoulder from a Westminster aide. 
And not an ""Illustrated Chronicle of the Coal Trade"" in sight.",1
5,Blackened chicken starter was excellent. The lamb was cooked to perfection and the service was very good. Would definately recommend,1

3,Didn't quite live up to my expectations,-1
5,Recently had the tasting menu - was a great way to enjoy a variety of their dishes with great wine pairings.  Really enjoyed the calamari rings added to the scallop dish.  Minced pigeon was excellent.  Deer was perfectly cooked and the tandoori salmon was amazing.,1
4,"This really is a top place, be sure to go in the bar first but you can't order your food in the bar!!
The flavours of the food are superb , different spices coming at you in succession, difficult to describe well enough.
I've been a few times and nearly always the food is great.. try the Game Platter!!
On the downside the staff are proficient, but don't seem to do 'friendly'... it seems to be dliberate.
Reckon on £50 t0 £70 each for dinner and wine.",1
4,"went to the Cinnamon Club on Saturday, and what a perfect spot to enjoy a special occassion. 
i'm just starting to appreciate Indian cuisine and this restaurant is the place to go to if you are in those same shoes. the food is flavorful, not drenched or overwhelmed by sauce and spice and heat. i had the seared chicken and while it was good, i think i liked my husband's pork loin better. i loved the sides we chose, my favorite being the spinach and mushroom stir-fry. i ended the meal with the pumpkin tart served with homemade clove ice cream - yum! 
the wait staff was so attentive, specifically making sure that i knew all of the ingredients and cooking temperatures to the items i chose - guess the black dress i wore no longer hides the pregnant belly i've got! they also brought me pillows for extra back support, so thoughtful.
only bummer was that there was a private party going on in the swanky lounge downstairs, so we couldn't retire there for a drink and further ambience after our meal.",1
5,"I was slightly apprehensive about this place. If you are a curry purest, then this place may offend. See the Cinnamon Club as an experiment in fine dining in the style of the Indian Sub-continent.
 Ambiance is first class, which isn't always easy to achieve with large spaces like this old library the restaurant now occupies. Ask to sit on the bench seating along the back for a kingly view of the whole dining area - great for people watching.
 Yes it is expensive - both times I've been there the bill has come to £84 for three courses including wine & coffee. They do a special set menu for £22, but you have to order before 7:30 or after 9:30 - an absolute bargain in my honest opinion!
 Can't fault the food or service. Some of the waiters try a little too hard, and would benefit from being more relaxed, but I've never had to wait long for anything. If you come here on your own, you're offered a newspaper to read while you wait!
 The staff, while initially seeming a little dry are very friendly once you get to know them. I've been twice last week and I'll definitely go back - this will probably become my favourite haunt while I'm working in Westminster.
 Cool little bar downstairs which would be great for a Qype party. AHunter are you reading this?",1
5,"When we stayed in London for a week last time, my fiancée and me lived on indian food basically for the whole time. Almost made it, and with highly diverse results.
 We went to Cinnamon Club upon recommendation by a friend. Otherwise, I guess, we would not have found it. When I checked the web page online, I feared we would not get a reservation for dinner on the same day, but that was not an issue.
 Passing by Big Ben and Westminster Abbey, we found the Cinnamon Club in a side road. What a nice place! We sat in the middle of the lower floor, and it was quite big and lively there. Three business gentlemen at the next table each had 2 cellphones sitting next to their cutlery and were heavily discussing. Not the perfect place for a dinner for two, I thought. But I deemed wrong.
 The service was top! We had about four different waiters during the stay, and we never felt we had to wait for anything. Quite a difference when you're used to my home town's restaurants.
 The food is, as others noted here, a mixture of anglo/french/european style and indian cuisine. Don't expect the usual stuff for the usual price. You won't get it at Cinnamon Club. Admittedly, for enjoying a snug evening with garlic naan and massalla gosht, I still prefer my favourite indian place I go to since many years. But to make a difference, Cinneman Club is the place to go for lovers of indian cuisine.
 We chose a la carte, and spent something like 280 pounds that evening for starters, excellent meals, and an enchanting dessert, each accompanied by fit and proper choices of wine. I can't remember leaving that much money in a restaurant for a single dinner before, and I didn't believe I'd be willing to do so, either. After visiting Cinnamon Club, I changed my mind, and we will go there again, the next time we visit London.
 One down-side was the bar down stairs was closed for a private reception that evening we were there, so we could not test that. Well. There should always be something to look forward to, the next time.",1
4,"Fantastic place, great service, and like a reversal of the old colonial era. pricey, but an experience worth indulging in.",1
5,The (anglo)-indian breakfasts were amazing. One day I had Kedgeree and another morning I had the Uttapam. Absolutely delicious. I wanted to go back for dinner but they were fully booked until 9.45.,1
4,"I'm not a great Indian food eater but got taken here by my partner who is and I have to say it was very pleasant.
 We were seated in the old library while we waited for a table and sipped on Kia Royales.
 We were then taken to our table in the main room which was lovely. It had a real buzzy atmosphere and the food served was delicious.
 The table next to us was having the taster menu which I believe is quite expensive £100+ but definitely worth a try on a revisit.
 The wine list complemented the type of food very well and I can see why this place is so popular. Its a modern twist on the typical Indian type restaurant and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.",1
3,"the food was great. it was definitely expensive, but the food and atmosphere is worth it for a special occasion. however, i knocked it down a star for the service. it was bad. i experienced this across london. you expect such a nice plan to have excellent service, and it should for the price, but it didnt. it was very gluten free friendly, so points there including a special GF appetizer for me. hardly any GF dessert options though. i'd give it 3.5 if i could, but i was so annoyed by the bad service i chose 3 stars.",-1
4,Very nice Indian in the Old Westminster Library.  I went with the sea bass which was great.  The broccoli side dish is excellent--just a bit spicy.  Good wine list and nice venue.,1
5,"This is a treat. Expensive yes but something avant garde/ innovative mouth-wateringly different with some high end twists to Indian Cuisine. One of the places that is on my must list when visiting London.
The amuse bouchees (freebies) tell you you are in for a treat.
Decor fresh and open with a funky little cocktail bar downstairs
Quite good people watching offered here too

4,"We had their prix-fixe Christmas lunch. It was a lovely experience. All of the reviews are correct: it is an expensive place!
It was a real treat and plenty of food. We started with a spiced martini, followed by a potato fritter. We ordered a spicy vegetable dish and a prawn stir fry to start. I had the curry prawns, the person with me had halibut. It was so fresh. They brought another vegetable course in between. For a side, I had cucumber with yogurt and the person I was with had aubergine. The naan was warm and soft. I had a fresh fruit dish for dessert that had a thin layer of lemongrass gelatin over it which was interesting, albeit strange. The person with me had a lemon cardamom cake which was delicious. 
The waitstaff was only okay. They were very busy due to the Christmas holiday, but I found them to be unattentive. The atmosphere in The Cinnamon Club is light and elegant.
Their bar is a real find- its a library with a bar tucked in the corner. They have an extensive drink menu. 
It was a great Christmas lunch.",1
3,"The Cinnamon Club offers Indian style breakfasts that are an interesting take on the traditional British fry up. So if you fancy something with a bit of spice to get you going in a morning it's worth a visit. 
I'm not sure that their food agreed with me though as the spicy scrambled eggs, Bombay spiced vegetables with cumin and a jasmine tea that I washed it all down with was a bit too much of a taste explosion to experience first thing. I would definitely go back to eat later on in the day as the food and service were top notch, but Indian for breakfast just seems a bit wrong (yes I admit to eating least nights curry when I woke up, but that's just somehow different, isn't it?!).
I'll be sticking to bacon sarnies and fry ups, but if you for those of you who like it hot at all times of the day then it's nice to know that there are variations of the great British breakfast also available on London's morning menu.",-1
5,"Upscale, great food and service.  Very flavorful and authentic.  3rd time here and I will be back.",1
4,"This is Indian curry in a fantastic building that may or may not have previously been some old library, but is somehow not stuffy. Delicious food.",1
4,"One of the nicest dinner venues I've eaten at.  A gorgeous walk up opens up into an even lovelier setting.  Bookshelves line the 2nd floor walkway that overhangs the main dining room.  Huge vaulted ceilings in what must be an old bank or library of some repute.  
Went in for a late dinner and most every gentleman was wearing a suit and tie.  It was a bit of a shocker considering 2 of our group of 5 were wearing short sleeve t-shirts.  But I'm sure nobody in the restaurant enjoyed themselves or appreciated the food as much.  The food isn't the classical traditional type of Indian food you'd find at Brick Lane or Artesia, CA.  It's certainly more refined and updated but no less delicious.  I would have loved some curry, tikka masala, korma and whatnot the meal was very good.  We split a bunch of appetizers; salmon carpaccio, lamb curry, black chicken breast and mix of spicy Indian veggies.  The most traditional flavors and my favotire of the apps were the lamb curry and spicy Indian veggies.  The veggies packed a nice punch with some nice latent heat.  The black chicken and salmon weren't bad mind you but not very Indian and probably wouldn't order them again.  I ordered the lamb for main entree as well and was very satisfied.  The sauce was similar to a curry and the lamb was well cooked.  The biggest surprise was their naan.  Comparable to the best naan I've had anywhere.  Hot out of the oven, crispy of the bottom and a lovely way to pick up those extra juices.",1
1,"The food here is a total overstatement of good Indian food. Their menu is very pricy but the attention given to the actual served food is poor,to say the least. They seem to be trading upon their presentation skills rather than anything else. I love good quality Indian food and go to Indian all the time. This place was meant to be a treat for a friend but i have to say I was embrassed to have bought a friend. It certainly did not live up to it expectation or maybe that was the problem-having any expectation?!",-1
4,Been coming here for years and still love the food (and the downstairs bar). It helps that it's 5 mins walk away - a great local to have!,1
5,"Certainly not a cheap place, and you can feel it coming in. Think dark furniture, rose petals and water fountains. Along with attentive staff, this is a true treat to come to. If you have special dietary requirements, like I do, it can feel somewhat like you're inconveniencing the staff though.",1
5,I was impressed by the grace and beauty of this place when I ate there very recently. I think that the beauty of this place lies in the contrast between the gentlemen's club-style setting and the exoticism of modern Indian cuisine. Their early-bird menu offers really good value for 22.00 pounds.,1
5,"This place is outstanding. There's no better adjective. The setting, in the old Westminster Library, is absolutely inspired. At first glance, the menu looks like it's trying a bit too hard but when they can get away with it because the food lives up to the hyperbole on the menu. During the Christmas period they serve a signature cinnamon champagne drink which is amazing. Great food, great service, great wine list, great setting.",1
5,"Yum yum yum yum. Another wonderful Indian restaurant in the Westminster area. Delicate dishes and interesting combinations of flavours, all set in a beautiful old building. It's full of MPs and business men at lunchtime, but don't let that put you off! If you love Indian food but usually stay away from it with the fear or feeling fat or bloated, come and try here! It's a very different dining experience to your regular Indian takeaway. First class service too.",1
4,"I really liked the place. the ambience was fantastic - it is a great building. 
The food was excellent and unusual Indian cuisine. 
Donwnside were slightly snobbish waiters - we went there for taste4london experience and we felt a bit like second class customers.",1
5,Great place to eat. I took my girlfriend there and she loved it. Does cost a bit more that other places but you get what you pay for. Staff are great and I can't wait to go back. I have been once for breakfast and that is well worth it. 5 stars,1
5,"I had long desired a meal at the Cinnamon Club having had one of their cook books for some time, and on the occasion of my 40th birthday finally made it there, and if anything the food exceeded all expectations.
 This is the ultimate in classy Indian cuisine and my main course of rack of lamb with a corn sauce is one of the best dishes I have ever tasted - seasoned to perfection, full of subtlety yet still delivering the kind of hot spice kick I love.
 Some do say this restaurant is expensive, and it is certainly not cheap, but I think the rack of lamb, for example, at around £24 was well worth it. The drinks however are a bit extreme with the cheapest bottle of beer at £4.",1
5,Went for London Restaurant week - £15 lunch. Food was fantastic from first bite to the last and just the right quantity. The Lychee and rose petal martini was not as good as Hakkasan but you can't have everything!,1
4,"great resturant, food is very good and staff are very friendly, it is quite expensive but well worth it.
The decor is very good and the atmosphere has a very nice ambiance.",1
5,Best meal I had in England.  Top notch for this New Yorker.,1
5,"Set in the heart of westminster, the ambience is akin to a typical london gentlemens club where you imagine the great and the good of the world mix and decide on the fate of countries. The service here is exceptional (as you would expect), and the food is not only delicious, but has some of the best presentation you will find for any indian restaurant in the UK. The wine list could (perhaps) be better, and i think sometimes, when quiet (mid-week) the atmosphere is not as lively as i would like - but if you are out with friends or for an intimate evening go for it!",1
3,"Great food and great service, slightly expensive but the food tastes great. They do have early bird menus which are good deals but is limited to certain times.
Great atmosphere and friendly staff",-1
4,"Fabulous upscale Indian cuisine. Beautiful building, great menu - would highly recommend.",1
3,"Good place to taste delicious Indian food. Good service. Ambience is a bit posh. Nice place to take your inlaws if you're willing to spend some money.
Glamourous bar downstairs in de the basement, although a bit quiet when we were there, even on a Saturday night.",-1
5,"Had an excellent experience here.  Dinner was really, really good.  Well spiced and flavored.  Very atypical menu for an Indian restaurant (bison, pheasant, etc.).  Room was very elegant and service was prompt and informed.  It's very expensive, but worth it for the experience and food.",1
5,"The Cinnamon Club is in a class of its own, Truly the finest Indian restaurant in Britain a broad statement i know but as a real Curry aficionado and having dined at what are regarded as the best Indian restaurants in Britain i can tell you that none of them come close to the cinnamon club. The dishes are a kind of Indian/European fusion and are as good as any high end Michelin stared restaurant's I've been to, the decor and location is amazing think old English library meets Claridges. For a special night of amazing food i highly recommend the cinnamon club",1
5,A lovely place for dinner. Excellent food and service. I love the place. Ideal for a first date!,1
5,"Roti Chai is an absolute favorite. We have a tween and a teen and both love this restaurant. We generally go during the day where crowds are lesser, waiting 10-15 minutes if that. 
The ""street food"" menu is what we like on the upper floor, and consists of big plates and tapas style small plates. 
We mix it up every time and are never disappointed. 
This is a fantastic stop in London.",1
5,"Amazing food upstairs.incredible kulfi and chicken lollipops. 
Pani puri amazing
Chat papri
Lychee coconut and guava drink",1
4,"This is a good place to eat! Its loud its crowded:) but its smell good from 10 milles away. I like the street food so i sat upstairs! Downstairs its more for a formal dinner.
5 minutes after we order the first appetizer arrive and the flavour is great and wonderful. 
If you dont like spicy food then its just not your place. If you love indian food its just great. 
ITS GOODDDDDDDDD",1
4,Excellent food and service. My wife and I stopped in and sampled a bunch of items in the upstairs restaurants. Everything was really good and seasoned well.,1
3,"Roti Chai is located on Portman Mew S and near Portman St in Marylebone, London.
We found Roti Chai highly rated in Yelp and we would like to check it out.  We came here for dinner and they're not busy at all.  The hostess asked us would like to try street kitchen or dinning room.  We hesitated the different and checked the menu pretty the same dishes.  
We prefered to have Indian Tapas and we could ordered a bit more. 
Garlic Naan - it's fresh made, soft and fluffy. 
Vegetable Samosa - it's good but not great.
Macher Jhol - fish curry just ok and not flavourful. 
Railway Lamb Curry - it's medicore and curry wasn't rich.
Overall, lacking food presentation and not authentic dish but the service was excellent.",-1
1,This restaurant is not good for families . When we went we had a long line . But this restaurant does not even have basics of taking people's names in a list . They prioritize two people . We had to wait more than an hour even though they said the wait would be 45 minutes because they send people who came even 30 minutes later than us they were just two people . The restaurant is full of two sets that can be combined but they don't do it . So if you are more than two people especially 3 or 5 don't waste your time waiting here .,-1
5,Simply lovely Indian small plates. Super tired after 2 weeks of travel and walking into the place the smell was intoxicating. We were greeted warmly and had great service and food. Will definitely be back on our next trip to London,1
1,Very rude host. Have had much better Indian food. Once was enough. Twice we arrived before closing and were told not seating anymore. Finally got in and not impressed.,-1
4,"Great meal with an interesting atmosphere. You can choose upstairs for street food and downstairs for fine dining. We chose downstairs and had a few small dishes all very good. Next time we will try the upstairs menu.
Flavors reminded me of my time in India.",1
4,"Oh Roti Chai how I've missed you!!!  Roti Chai isalways our first stop when visiting London and one of our favorite Indian restaurants in the city!  We have always ate at the dining room downstairs.  We love the vibrant and cozy atmosphere.  On this particular trip we ordered: Tandoori chicken, chili garlic prawns, crab and fish cakes, saffron chicken tikka, curry leaf potatoes and butter chicken.  Everything  (as always) is fantastic!!  See you next time!",1
1,"The place tricks you into thinking you're going to get the same good in the upstairs restaurant. 
If you want the authentic stuff, they have it in the bottom floor. Unfortunately, we waited an hour for nothing in the street food menu. Came here from the states because of the reviews.
Going to Dishoom. They have the same menu throughout and worth the wait.
They even charge service charge on drinks we got earlier. We didn't end up eating there.",-1
4,"Came here for a reserved dinner. Started with some refreshing drinks, virgin cocktails actually: kovalam beach, lemonade elderflower drink. Then had the fantastic chilli garlic prawns and saffron chicken Tikka. Absolute delight!
Looking to order Raan e Baluchi, a slow cooked Welsh lamb shoulder shank with cumin tandoori masala with some roti selection.",1
5,"DELICIOUS!! After a day of touring around London, this meal hit the spot. So they have an upstairs level for Indian street food and a downstairs level for dining in. We dined in and was satisfied with the service and the food. Must try if you are in London!!!
P.S. the main dish doesn't come with rice.",1
5,"Incredible Indian Restaurant. 
Food is perfect and the place is really nice. 
To share a diner with friends on a Friday night,it's perfect :)",1
4,"I had just got back from India and I almost couldn't see another Indian dish to save my life but my friends insisted! Soooo good. This fusion place combines the best flavors of India with an airy lightness in the dishes that is a superb compliment. The vibe was decked out cool and the staff was very friendly. 
Fav eats - chicken lollipops vs their green sauce is a tight call, chili paneer is feisty and the samosa chat was delish 
Overall, this place is brilliant",1
2,"In a city with no shortage of good food, Roti Chai is definitely a runt of the litter. The branding and decor are cool, but there's not a whole lot of depth below the surface. 
The food is rather bland for Indian food, and the whole street food shtick has been become rather tired and trite. This must be the universe's way of saying ""beta, don't waste your shillings on such mediocre khaana when you can eat your ammi's cooking and buy her a gift with the money instead"": point taken universe! 
The cocktails are actually fantastic here, and the few my brother and I tried were delicious, and reasonably priced...the food on the other hand was uninspired. The agni ""fire"" wings were fatty and chewy and as far them being ""dangerously hot and spicy"" per our waitress...mah, me thinks not. The English concept of ""spicy"" is laughable and the general lack of ""mirch"" left most dishes lacking in any sort of real flavor. 
I'd stop in for drinks and maybe a samosa...beyond that, just go to Dishoom!",-1
4,"A bit of a secret tip this, and I'll be eternally grateful to the friend who suggested a quick curry at the end of an evening. We were amongst the last people in and food was delivered superfast. With trains to catch we were after a quick fix rather than romantic atmosphere making this a winner on all counts.",1
5,"Wanted late night Indian while in London so we popped into the Street Kitchen part of the restaurant and couldn't have been more pleased. The environment was lively and busy, but not too distracting, service was prompt, and food was amaaaaazing. We loved all our dishes -- So much flavor, spice, and depth! My husband and I tried an assortment of small dishes including the Hakka Chili Paneer salad, which was honestly, my favorite dish. It came with deep fried tofu cubes, green pepper slivers, tomatoes, and fresh chili, all tossed in a savory dressing over lettuce. The chili was fierce, which gave the warm salad a fun kick. 
Highly recommend going with a group and ordering all the things. Great small plates that make it easy to share, taste, and order more!",1
1,"Pedestrian food and terrible service
This location has two restaurants. The restaurant on the lower level is a formal sit down and upstairs is a casual first come first serve location. Front desk is understaffed and rude. They consistently seated others ahead of us in the upstairs location. After they seated us, the waiter forgot our order. We were waiting for 30 mins and when we followed up they told us we need to hurry up and order. When I told them, incredulously, that I have ordered and am waiting, the person went away from only to come back annoyed at us and took our order again. Not a word of apology. Food's not worth the hassle. Never going back.",-1
4,"As a vegan I'm a pretty big fan of Indian food. This place is pretty decent. Usually has a lot of people eating around here. If you like Indian food and spicy food, then this is the place for you. Otherwise, it might be hard to adjust haha.
Lots of good veggie dishes and I love their guava drink",1
5,"Delicious surprise.   We stopped to refuel after shopping and were thrilled with the tapas.  We had several chicken dishes,soma as, and rose lemonade.  Definitely would come here again for dinner next time.",1
5,Ate downstairs at the dining area. Must be a little bit more expensive than upstairs but it was worth it! The specials menu were amazing. The lamb special that was cooked for 16 hours was so tender and the butter chicken was one of the best I ever had!,1
3,"Not bad. It's not too traditional, a bit of a modern twist to the snacks and chaat. Overall everything we ordered was good. 
If I come back then I would definitely eat downstairs at the restaurant. They have a cool bar area that you can sit at while you wait... drinks are good too.",-1
4,"Love this place for casual dinners in the street kitchen upstairs. Everything I've tried has been delicious - from the refreshing papri chaat to the creamy kulfis - its all spot on. The naan sampler is great with anything, especially the curries, such as the pulusu chicken curry.
The only thing is that service can be a bit slow - a bartender had noticed that we weren't being serviced and had to alert a waitress to get to us. But besides that, I'll be back to try more of their contemporary take on Indian food!",1
4,"We brought our friends from out of town here and it was so much fun to try everything. I've learned that you need to make reservations and if you don't have one, there's a pub right next door where you can grab a beer while you wait! 
One of my favourite things here is chill paneer- AMAZZZZZING! It's spicy but the cheese is a nice balance and the texture of the cheese is chewy but so good. I don't really know how to describe paneer in a pleasing way but whatever it's amazing and you should try it. 
I also really loved the Macher jhol- excellent flavour and just enough spice. I still have yet to try their burger or sandwich, but I'm sure I'll be back sometime.",1
5,"Stellar experience! We ate in the dining room and it was phenomenal. Beautiful ambiance, warm, cozy and welcoming. All of the food was flavored impeccably. Even the garlic naan felt like the garlic was intentional and not just an after thought. So rich! The paneer pakora came with a brilliantly spicy sauce. It was like Indian mozzarella sticks in the very best way possible. Not diminishing any of the quality, just want to give a little context. My butter chicken was scrape your bowl clean good. Finish every drop good. You better order more naan good. The chicken was juicy and tender. Even my peppermint and fennel tea was great. What a great compliment to my meal. Highly recommend!",1
4,Really good Indian Food. The spice is mild but they can turn up the heat if asked.  There is an upstairs and downstairs.  Upstairs is Indian fusion soul food and informal.  Downstairs is traditional. We are downstairs and all I can say is Yum!   The servers were helpful in picking wine and recommending dishes.  So good. Will be eating here again!,1
5,So yummy! We took the recommendations based on another yelp review and we weren't disappointed. We ate the more casual street food and loved every bite. The cocktails were super yummy too! Next time we will try the formal dining room. No wonder this place is packed!,1
4,"I came here for lunch a little over a week ago.  I will get right to it.  The food is bonkers.  Roti has 2 dining rooms - a street kitchen and a dining room downstairs.   I ate in the street kitchen.  I guess the street kitchen is focused on street-style food.  We ordered tons of stuff as they recommend you order an appetizer and a main.  I got the chicken wings and a lamb kebab burger.  The food was ridiculously good.  I went there with a couple of foodies and they were ""oooh...ahhhh"" over everything.   
The service was pretty poor, we were constantly waving the staff people down like stranded people on an island wave down a passing ship. That said the food more than made up for it.  I can brag all day about the food in New York, blah, blah, blah, but there is nothing like Roti Chai.  Go to Roti Chai.  You'll love it.",1
4,"I LOVED the Hakka Chili Paneer. The paneer had the best flavor and texture I have ever experienced. The dish itself was a new way of eating paneer for me, a warm salad. I would LOVE to know how they prepared the paneer! Also ate the Gobi Manchurian, which was also good.
I went back a second time because I was so thrilled with my first visit. This time the service was not very good and the Hakka Chili Paneer was WAY more spicy. I did speak with the host and he said he would speak with the kitchen. He was very receptive of feedback.
The Orange Blush drink was also a very good virgin drink option, super fruity. The second time I went back I asked for it with less ice, because the first time it was about 80% ice and I finished it in two gulps.",1
5,Came to London on a family vacation. While shopping around the Oxford Circle area we all got hungry so I looked up somewhere close on yelp and decided to check this place out. What a gem! It's located right around the corner from Selfridges. There's seating upstairs (smaller plates) and a full restaurant down stairs. We elected for the full restaurant and couldn't have been happier. Food is excellent and the staff is very friendly and attentive. We enjoyed it so much that we came back again a few days later and tried upstairs this time around. The menu is slightly different with smaller plates but everything is just as good and didn't disappoint.  Will definitely be stopping by again the next time we're back in town!,1
5,"Can't be in London and not have Indian food.   I had wanted to eat her based on all the YELP reviews.   What I didn't realize was that they have two area,  one where the street food is served and the off a more upscale restaurant.  Tip, if you make reservations it'll be for the upscale part.   Not comparing as the food w had was amazing! 
Both areas are decorated slightly different,  but downstairs - the upscale portion is very nice and modern.  It gave me the feel of being on a train with overhead lugged,  etc.  But in the premium seating,  LOL.
We love every dish!   The flavors and spice were spot on.  Would definitely come here again!",1
4,"Is It possible to stay in London and not have Indian food? I don't think so.... 
Arrived for a late night dinner and there was a bit of a queue both downstairs (dining room) and upstairs (Street kitchen). The hostess told us that we could have a table at the street kitchen in about half an hour and offered us to wait at the bar and so we did.
Had a bellini while waiting and my boyfriend had a mango caipirinha and both was excellent. When our table was ready the hostess came and took our drinks and accompanied us to the table. 
It's recommended to pick 1-2 sidedishes and 1 maindish, but since we we're kindda full from our afternoon tea earlier this day we decided to choose 1 sidedish and 1 main each.
Had the chicken lollipops which I highly recommend for sidedish and also the chicken samosas - really tasty. 
Both had the pulusu chicken for main course and I loved it... My boyfriend found it a bit to spicy though. It was served with rice. We ordered mango fizz and orange blush to drink and both was yummy. 
Quick and polite service.",1
3,"I'd bookmarked this place awhile ago and had been waiting for an opportunity to go here. Shopping with my brother on Oxford street today, provided that opportunity.
We needed a quick lunch before another appointment, so I couldnt relax and enjoy the chaat - paani puri / bhelpuri etc. We opted straight for the protein dishes.
The chicken lollipops were good, but standard fare. The agni fire wings, were mind blowingly spicy in a good way. But be warned - this is only for chilli addicts. You can't handle the spice otherwise.
The manchurian chicken was a let down, especially as it was served with a very thin sauce and plain rice (Its a very Indian Chinese dish, served almost dry and with fried rice) the taste was good, but it was a disappointment purely because of its name. They should call it sweet and sour chicken or something.
Brother enjoyed his bun kebab.
However, the only thing that really stood out for me was the hot chocolate with its lovely cinnamon notes.
Service was efficient and friendly. I might return to check out the chaat items, but for a meal, I'd rather go elsewhere.",-1
2,"The service was terrible and the food was okay. The waitress brought our bread 10 minutes after we had finished all of our other courses. The samosas we ordered still never arrived and after telling her again she said ""okay Ill do you a favor and not bring them"". They throw out ALL food after without letting you take it home!! How is that even a valid option-- What about food waste? Overall a really frustrating experience that could have been diverted by better service and a disclaimer when ordering extra food, with intention to bring some home, that they toss it in the rubbish like their service.",-1
5,"Really nice food, true to Indian tastebuds. No watered down versions of indian dishes
Very nice chaat and pain poori, hard to get them as good even in India",1
5,"This is a refreshing twist on Indochinese street food.
A regular place we like to visit once or twice a month. There is no table booking so be prepared to queue if you are going at busy dinning times. If you prefer something a little more formal, they have a dinning room downstairs that caters a different menu (more a la carte).
A favourite in the heart of London",1
3,"After reading reviews, I was hoping that this place will be good but I was disappointed. I ordered hakka chilli paneer for starters and idli sambhar for main course, along with mohito. Hakka chilli was good which raised my expectations. But idli sambhar just fell flat. The salt was less in sambhar, idli was not at all fluffy and seemed cakey. Mohito was terrible. Decor is wanna be Indian.",-1
3,"We had the street food upstairs. The food is tasty but the portions are really small. You would need to order atleast 2-3 dishes to have a full stomach. They also need to add more on their menu.
Also, the place is not particularly kid friendly. If you have really small kids, i would not recommend this place to you.",-1
4,"Not far from the shopping of Oxford Street hides this little gem. I glanced at the menu outside and it's a bit confusing. They have two dining areas. Downstairs for a slightly more expensive menu. 
I ate on the main floor, street kitchen menu - casual dining. The prices are very fair for London standards. The chicken lollipops are outstanding! Almost every table around me ordered them as well.
I had the lamb curry with rice instead. Perfectly spiced and there is nice heat to it! Portion size may be a bit small if you're hungry and didn't order an appetizer. 
The dessert, almond & saffron phirni, was great ending to the meal. Lightly sweetened, great for not-a-sweet-tooth person. 
The only reason for 4* is the 12.5% mandatory service charge, no matter the party size. They have plenty of staff walking around and very pleasant to talk to but I am not a fan of mandatory service charges.",1
4,"Authentic, delicious, friendly staff, good service and reasonably priced!
Can't wait to go back.
Loved this place - recommend the paneer starter (but very very spicy) and the duck keema which comes with a buttery roll.
Only let down was the choice of beers",1
5,"Excellent food, great service. Get the pomegranate martini and the chicken lolllipops!!",1
5,"Okay this was the best Indian food I've had so far in London. Nice place, good vibe and excellent food! Went here as a group of 3, and at around 8:15 pm; they had a 5 minute wait for the Street Kitchen. They also have a fine dining area, which we weren't really interested in.
We ordered some Chilli Paneer for the table, which came after our entrees -- but it was good in a way. The Chilli Paneer's spice level is nuclear. I usually enjoy spicy food, but even I couldn't handle their spice level towards the end.
For main course, I tried their Macher Jhol. It was absolutely delicious! I wasn't too impressed with the portion size. At £8.50, I expected a bit more.. but whatever portion was served was absolutely yumm!
Definitely recommend this if you are into spicy and delicious food!",1
5,"I had heard that London has the best Indian food in the world. I am fortunate to live near a local Indian restaurant that is outstanding. I have had Indian food in other countries as well. Here in London, I don't think anything could be better than Roti Chai. I had prawns in a delicious tangy and sweet sauce and my wife had a lamb dish. The lamb was tender and fell off the bone. We also ordered the Nan with a hint of orange zest. I love Nan in any form and this did not disappoint. We also order drinks an dessert. I had a    Caipirinha that was muddled with Mango and lime, perfect. If in London, in the Mayfair section, don't miss out on this place.",1
4,"Roti Chai is separated into a ground floor street kitchen, serving modern Indian street food specifically made for sharing and a dining room downstairs, serving a more formal a la carte menu. As we fined in on ground floor we can only give our review on the Street Kitchen.
So the ground floor was an informal dining scene resembling much like a upmarket canteen with upscaled retro Indian food labels as posters. It had a nice buzzing atmosphere with a good amount of sunlight coming in giving the place a warm vibe accentuated by the warm glow lighting. The other diners in the restaurant were mostly South Asian which must say a lot about the authenticity of flavours. 
Plenty of staff although nearly always occupied which meant it was hard to get their attention at times. However food was delivered quickly and service was friendly and welcoming.
Aloo papri chaat
A sensational dish using a wide combination of textures and flavours making each bite as exciting as the first bite. Wheat crisp bases gave it that crunchy texture and held onto it throughout and this was contrasted by the fluffy potatoes and chickpeas soaking up the flavours. Pomegranates gave it a burst of sweetness against the silky plain yogurt whilst basil added a nice refreshing aromas against the lovely hot and tangy chutney and mild sweet spices 
Dhokla
I was very surprised how moist and airy this steamed chickpea cake was. They must have been finely grounded to produce such a spongy smooth texture. It was subtly sweet with a nice light drizzle of tangy chutney on top to lift its flavour 
Pani puri 
This dish was quite forgettable and didn't offer much to the palate. The semolina shells were very nice and delicately crisp but with only a bit of potato and only one chickpea in there, you could barely taste it. The tamarind water was too overpowering, even with just a little bit it masked all flavours with its strong sour notes 
Bun kebab
I did really enjoy how fragrant and aromatic the lamb patty was with the addition of spices and herbs in there giving it a good punch of flavour. However the bun was way too thick and dense to allow the flavours to project through, either that or the patty was too thin. A lovely side of tangy chutney to help it along with flavour but still a wasted patty 
Bombay bhel puri 
A dish that always gets me coming back to this restaurant. A fantastic mixture of crunchy wheat crisp, puffed rice, spicy red onions mixed in with little cubes of fluffy potatoes, chickpeas and more. It created such a moreish bite with the variation of textures and all in a refreshing tangy tamarind spice.
Idli Sambar
The most important thing about this dish is getting the steamed rice cakes right and achieving that sponginess to soak up the curry and they got it spot on. They were so light and fluffy that were a joy to eat it with the lovely mild vegetable curry that had its own lovely complex savoury flavours. Quite a thin consistency which made it easier to absorb by the rice cakes. 
Aloo gobi
A side of cauliflower and potatoes. This dish was fantastic and all very well spiced in a thick curry paste making it the most spiciest dish we ordered. It also had depth and complexity in its flavours. The potatoes were incredibly fluffy and with skin on giving it that nice contrast in texture. Cauliflowers were cooked till soft so blended in well with the onions that helps added a nice sweetness to the dish 
Almond and saffron phirni
Resembling somewhere in between of semolina and panna cotta with its slight graininess and jelly like texture and milkiness. It was incredible and I love the saffron in there giving it that lovely sweet spiced aroma to it. Almonds finished it nicely by offering it a nice nutty crunch.
I do love Roti Chai Street Kitchen. It's a no reservation place unless you come in a large group. But food is served so quickly that people leave in no time so you don't tend to have to wait long. Dishes have room for improvement but the combinations of flavours and textures in some of the dishes just blows me away and keeps me from coming back. They're all so visually stunning too. Prices are very reasonable and it's great that they come in small sizes so you can order a few or lots to share. Great for birthday celebrations too and for those who are worried about spice levels, most of the dishes we ordered were very mild apart from the Aloo Gobi.",1
5,Hi.. really amazing restaurant .. small dishes with many delicious different flavours .. I will visit it again for sure next time I am in London,1
5,"Came here 2 years ago for our honeymoon and just had it tonight...still amazing! FYI, the wings are super spicy but full of flavor!",1
3,"Having heard of the reputation of Indian food in London I had great expectations but was a bit disappointed.  This restaurant is in the Marble Arch neighborhood.  There's two different floors and the first floor seems to be more casual while the bottom floor is more formal, for walk in the wait was only around 10 minutes. I got the lamb curry dish and the lamb was very dry and the sauce not very flavorful.  The chapati that came with it was very dry as well and I should have opted for rice instead.  I tried the chicken curry dish which was much better.",-1
4,"Stopped in for lunch at about 1:45, place was still packed. Had a short wait; host had me order my beer and I was seated before it arrived. 
Ordered the chicken lollipop for a starter. Very good, hot, not greasy tasting. 
Then had the railway lamb curry (with potato). It came with two chopati (like a burrito) so I skipped the naan. (Garlic naan wasn't available, maybe just in the dining room? Another reviewer noted it was very good)
It was very good; I felt I couldn't really taste lamb however. 
It didn't appear that the basement dining room was open, there wasn't anyone down there when I used the toilet (lavatories) after eating. 
Net-net I would go back. The fact that it was packed with all the choices around (Selfridges & Marks and Spencer food courts, for example) attest to its popularity.",1
5,"My number 1 restaurant ..
All the menu is amazing special biryanis and samosas try the chicken burger as well",1
5,"My cousin who lives in London told us about this place - it was awesome!  We were visiting from Chicago.  Very crowded but their service was impeccable - thank you to Sarah.  We ordered chicken lollipops, pani puri, bhel puri, aloo chaat papdi, railway lamb curry and Manchurian chicken and it was all amazing.  The lychee martinis were perfect.  We would highly recommend this place if you are in London.",1
4,"Good indian food. It has two options for seating - 1) Serving street food 2) Full family size restaurant.
We tried the street food one. the food was just awesome.
We got chicken lolipop. It was ok.We also ordered railway lamb curry and macher jhol. Both of them were awesome.Will highly recommend these !
The ambiance is ok and service is also fine.Will highly recommend this place !",1
5,"I think everyone needs to eat upstairs first and then try the restaurant downstairs.  We were simply speechless after eating our entrees. It was simply that good. The service was excellent. They were there for our every need. We started this awesome meal with two small plates...Gilafi Seekh Kebab and Chicken 65. Both of these dishes were spicey hot and we were thankful for the beer and water.  Our entrees were on the milder side, but they were packed full of flavor. I got Malaba Mooli Prawns and my husband got Malai Methi Paneer. We also got some garlic butter roti. The shrimp was cooked to perfection. I have no idea what was in that sauce, but I literally could have licked the bowl. The Paneer was vegetarian. It was made with cheese chunks. Again, you could lick the bowl. The Roti bread was perfect for licking the bowl and looking polite. This was by far my favorite meal of the trip. You know I will be back to this restaurant.",1
5,REALLY TASTY!  We had the small plates upstairs and were able to taste a lot of different dishes and all of them were amazing.  The service was also excellent!  I highly recommend Roti Chai.,1
4,"very trendy and the food was excellent.  We tried several items and the Lamb curry as well as the chicken curry were excellent.  order the Lamb with rice instead of the roti it comes with.  
also the pani puri is delicious just delicious.   its very loud so do nit go for business meetings but definitely a place to go with friends.  would not recommend for kids.   too busy
i loved the papaya melon juice as well.",1
2,"For the prices I cannot believe how poor the service was and that the drinks were served warm and the food cold.
We sat in the street kitchen section and all chaats were £4+ (Which makes one wonder when this up market street food trend will just implode).
I asked what the most popular small plates were, which is how I ended up with the chicken samosas (piled with yoghurt, pomegranate, spicy sauce and crispy bits) and the chicken lollipops. The samosas were lukewarm under their cup of cold yoghurt but still crunchy (and tasty, I really liked them). The lollipops were pretty boring to me but the husband loved them.
I ordered a prosecco cocktail that came out instantly, which would explain why it was flat and warm. I sent that shit back because come on. Really? The samosas had also come out right after I ordered them, so I guess they just make a bunch of food and drinks at once and then send it out when it's ordered? Lame.
My husband ordered the railway lamb curry, which was teeny tiny for the £9 price tag. Kept having to flag down the servers, even though it wasn't too busy (we were heading off to a show so had to leave at a specific time).
Bummed out as I had been wanting to try this place out since they attended a yelp event and served a fantastic (hot) chaat.",-1
3,"Stept in for a quick lunch. Clean, not too shabby. Wouldn't come pver from the other part of town for this but it's good for its price.",-1
5,"Best Indian food I've ever had. Ever. The lamb was incredible, the naan flavors are delicious and the atmosphere is great. If you eat Indian in one place in London eat it here.",1
5,"We found Roti Chai through Yelp. We tried the taste manual with cocktail. I cannot wait till I get out of the restaurant to give the restaurant a 5-Star rating. For £35/person, my husband had a martini and I had a mojito. We thought we chose one of the 3 options from the starters and one of the four main courses. But NO - we got ALL OF THE 3 and 4, plus lentil soup and desert. Every single item on the manual is delicious and the plating is beautiful. The spices are so tasty but not overwhelming, that you can still taste the freshness of the meat and vegetable. I am now waiting for my desert and I am sure that they will be as good. Thumbs up. It is by far the best Indian food I have ever had. We will definitely return.",1
5,"6 stars.
the food here is really amazing.
recommended: chili prawns & lamb kebab (both are appetizers), garlic naan, butter chicken.
highly recommended: the CHEESECAKE.
this place will not disappoint!",1
5,We stopped in last year during our trip to UK...recommend by family as a place to not miss...went with high expectations and  were blown away by the quality and taste of the dishes.  Unique takes on classic dishes...steer food elevated to fine dinning quality and beyond.  Our kids were loving the place to. We rave to all our friends visiting and they all thank us afterwards....definitely crowded so if you can sneak in a little before the crowds show up you will be much happier....happy eating!!!,1
5,It was a little hidden jem for my friends and I that we stumble onto. We love the modern hip decor and the service was good as well. We liked the food and drinks :),1
5,"This place really has some incredible food. And the small plates versus main allows you to trial and share some really fabulous dishes. The most popular one we saw was the warm paneer salad on every table. It was really quite spicy and warm lettuce could throw you off, but definitely worth consuming. I could have eaten one whole one by myself, but then I wouldn't have been able to taste anything else due to the spice level. 
Our table also ordered the railroad lamb curry stew, which was quite good and the ""burrito"" like wrap for it did not quite hold in all the stew. Would possibly recommend ordering a side of rice to eat with this. And the chicken burger, but I don't remember its name off the top of my head. This was more than enough food for 2 people for lunch, though everything was so good it wouldn't hurt to order more just to try everything on the menu. Or bring a big group here so you can split everything.",1
5,"What a fantastic experience from start to finish.  
We descended into the downstairs to some of the most elegant modern decor, complemented by equally polished service.  The surroundings and attentiveness was pitch perfect.
Everything we tried from the menu was delicious but the standouts were the paneer and pepper kabobs dusted with chili and from our entrees, the palak paneer, tarka dahl and chicken tikka were absolutely heavenly.  Our cocktails could have been made a little less sweeter but otherwise, the meal was perfect.  We will be returning here before returning home!",1
4,"Come here a couple of times. Like, but not love it. Good food, OK vibe, decent night out, but nothing too special.",1
4,"So many good reviews already for this restaurant and once you are there, it is easy to see why.  Read them and I agree with them all!
The food is so flavoursome and good portions (I've only been here for lunch).  Service has always been good with the serving staff knowledgable in what they are serving.  You can easily come her for lunch, have a good meal and be back in the office within the hour or there abouts which, is always a bonus.
Not so great on desserts but the starters and the mains are soooo nice it doesn't really matter.  So far, I've not eaten anything here that I did not like will be back and back again.",1
5,"Best Indian food I've ever had. No lie. 
Downstairs dining area: 
I'm veggie, and was surprised to see so many options on the menu. I started out with the palak papri chaat. Excellent. My husband and I shared the Schezwan chilli paneer. Seriously, hold me down. Bada**. I then had the palak paneer and tarka daal, accompanied by the roti and naan plate. Wow, the paneer melted in my mouth, the palak was of the gods, and the daal was unique, and tasted like the most epic buttery daal goodness I've ever had. Broke my taste buds. Rico. Rico. Rico.
The service was excellent. The waiter and manager were both very present, without being overbearing. 
Def going back!
Update:
2 days later we went back to try the Indian street food (upstairs). Def underwhelming. They were slammed, and maybe that affected preparation/service. I wouldn't go back for the street food, but would for sure go back to the dining room food.",1
1,Not real Indian food. I lived in New York and other states and never had Bad Indian food. This food was nasty. London you need to learn better,-1
4,I actually ate downstairs in the restaurant. Food was  really good. Garlic naan was amazing. Upstairs is more fast food style with different menu. Was packed so I would suggest reservations if avail as an option. Giving 4 rather than 5 due to wait staff. Brought out entree before starters (and not at same time as my friends entree so it got cold while I waited for hers to come as it is rude to eat in front of someone whom is hungry).,1
4,"Good food, great presentation and a creative menu. Definitely worth a visit for those dealing with a craving for Indian food.",1
3,"The service here is terrible! It's too bad because the food is actually decent. The pani puri and chicken lollipops were flavorful. The chicken curry and cauliflower veg dish were okay. Not super authentic but good enough for the price. 
I wish I could give them 3.5 stars. Good enough for quick Indian food, but do not expect anything from the service. It was some of the worst I've ever experienced.
If you want fantastic Indian, I would still go to Dishoom.",-1
5,"Very nice. Appreciated the space usage and the decor. Waited a short time for a table, but the staff was very helpful w/a cocktail. Food came fast, was tastie and delicious. Portions were spot on, shared w/college. Happenings spot. Go for a great night. Serve lunch too.",1
5,"We ate on their lower level and found that the food was fantastic, the service was warm and engaging, and the location was convenient!  Very well done in every regards.  Our server was charming and attentive, the food was so good and they offered an interesting menu with some unexpected items.  
Happy to refer friends and family here!",1
4,"If the place is full with a lot of Indians it must be a good place right? This place is full with both Indian business men and Indian families, so expect a noisy crowd but also great food.
I feel lucky to love Indian food and even more lucky to have found this place. I have not yet tried the second floor dining restaurant but I do love the ground floor street food restaurant. It's a light, clean and open, modern interior with some Indian street signs. 
The chai is tasty and has real spices, the chilli paneer is nicely spicy (really great but actually quite spicy) and comes with a lot of vegetables (a bit more paneer would have been great), the pani puri is a fun chaat dish and often not advisable to have in India because of the water used but here it's just great.
The Andra Pradesh chicken curry is a great spicy juicy curry and made me almost overeat myself, just like I use to do in India ;-)
The food is very affordable as well, great value!",1
3,"A Indian New Yorker has Indian food in London. 
The YELP community very rarely leads me astray, and although they were a little bit below the mark, Roti Chai was still a decent food option. To note, I am sure there are plenty other fantastic Indian spots in this city, that this wouldn't be my first pick going forward. But if you are in the neighborhood and want quick food and service this would probably be your best bet. Let's break it down shall we?
3 friends go to Roti Chai and share some Indian dishes Tapas style, and here's what we thought!
STREET SECTION:
1. Aloo Papri Chaat (4.8GBP) - The papri (circular fried bread base was crispy, but not fresh), the aloo (potato) was well made, and the toppings were tasty, but not fresh again. It was decent, and edible, but not exciting or by any means the best papri chaat I've had. Decently priced for the portion. Rating = 3/5
2. Chicken Lollipops (5.5GBP) - Good texture, taste, although could have used more flavor, spice, and seasoning. But still delicious, and one of the better dishes we had, good price for the portion. Rating = 4/5
3. Agni 'Fire' Wings (5.9GBP) - Well made, although I thought the chicken could have been cook a tad more. The accompanying sauces were good, and the wings were indeed spicy. I will have to say, they were not ""Indian spicy"" but still created some heat and were well ""sauced."" Again, good portion for the price. Rating = 4/5
4. Hakka Chilli Paneer (5.5GBP) - My favorite dish, as the quality of each paneer was perfection. Perfectly seasoned and flavored. The paneer was also cooked to perfection and tasted more fresh than 1, 2 and 3 (above). My one qualm with this dish was there was very little paneer, and vegetables took up most of the dish which isn't what you are paying for. Quality = 4/5, Quantity = 3/5, Rating = 3.5/5.
ROAD & RAIL:
1. Gobi Manchurian (7.2GBP) - This dish was all that was wrong. The gobi Manchurian was slightly stale, the sauce ruined the gobi, and gobi itself tasted like it was undercooked, the cauliflower (gobi) was still a bit hard and the dish just 100% made me wish I could have my 7GBP back, this dish really ruined the meal for me. Rating = 0/5. Sorry for the awful rating, but do not order this dish. 
2. Railway Lamb Curry (8.5GBP) - The Lamb was decently cooked, but could have been softer. Whenever I've had lamb curry, it has melted in my mouth, so this was a bit of a disappointment. It was not really spicy, but there was a bit of flavor, could have been cooked longer, and with more flavor. Overall probably would not order it again, but it was decent. Rating = 3/5.
SWEET:
1. Pistachio Kulfi (2.9GBP) - Although I love Kulfi, and it was good, it tasted like it was a ""packaged kulfi"" and they just unwrapped it an put it in a glass for me to eat. Still delicious, but still not the kind of fresh made Kulfi I was expecting. Rating 4/5. 
WiFi was good at the restaurant, and the service was solid (sometimes a bit spotty as no one really checked up on our table). Rating 4/5.
Final thoughts: 
Don't go out of your way to eat here. 
Decent Indian food for a cheap meal.",-1
5,"Dining room had good atmosphere, very prompt and attentive (bordering formal) service, and food that was fantastic. The flavors were deep and complex. The naan was fresh out of the oven and perfect. We ordered starters, mains, and desserts. All five members of our group raved about their dishes.",1
5,"My first night in London, we decided to stay near the action which luckily happens to be a quick ride from the flat where I'm staying. My bro suggested we have some Indian so we went into Roti Chai.
The upstairs of RC has an unassuming dining hall style space with a tapas inspired indian menu. Traditional diners can head downstairs for full waiter and menu service. We did and ordered:
Bengali fish and crab cakes - 9/10 
I couldn't differentiate between the two but both were of great consistency, dressed with wonderful colourful sauce and crunchy coated warmness. Near best fish/crab cakes ever had (two establishments in Chicago and Tanzania still hold those titles).
Schezwan chilli paneer- 8/10 
This was the other appetizer star of the night. A familiar dish but served on skewers for a change, this proved to be an excellent vegetarian option, and perfect for a mild palate.
Saagwala gosht- 9/10
Now as far as the mains were concerned, this is one for the books. I never order gosht but will have to remember it moving forward. Succulent goat meat in a green bath of herbs and yoghurt- almost the perfect 10 in my humble opinion. Could have been spicier though.
Butter chicken- 7.5/10
This was my main dish and met (but did not exceed) my expectations. Cooked beautifully, it paled in comparison to the other mains shared but no leftovers so don't be shy to order it up.
Awadhi lamb rack- 8.5/10
This was the best dish as far as presentation goes, and the lamb itself was tender and very flavourful, but its portion was a bit on the small side and it did not accompany the rice and naan as well as the curry and stew.
Garlic naan- 6/10- garlicky but could use some salt &butter. Bit flat. 
Rice- 8/10- your standard saffron rice, more dry than sticky. 
Wine- 10/10
This fabulous meal was enjoyed with a bottle of Pinot Grigio that I've also noted for future reference. 
Lastly for dessert we tried the 
chocolate mousse- 8/10. It was enjoyable. Small yet rich enough to be shared, it came with a cream sauce and was a great way to end the night, savour-wise. Wished I'd had a coffee with it for an ideal palate cleanser duo.
Overall: 4.5 but rounded up for atmosphere + service points. See pics.
I RECOMMEND- Exploring the menu! Nothing displeased us. 
EXTRA TIP-Slightly on the pricey side. We were in a celebratory (read: indulgent) mood but our bill was on the high end especially for the travelling diner (damn you ole GBP!) Stay upstairs in the street kitchen if you respect your budget ;)",1
5,"Chicken lollipops are amazing. And the chilli chicken burger was very good.. 
expect fusion style on the first floor, tapas style portions
Highly recommended!!",1
5,"DELICIOUS Indian food! We assumed that we'd have to wait a bit for a table since we went on a Saturday night, but we only had to wait about 5 minutes. We ate in the downstairs dining room.
My husband & I shared the butter chicken, the garlic naan, the basmati rice, and the Indian cheese appetizer. The food came astonishingly fast (like, 2 minutes after ordering, no joke) - but was incredibly fresh and delicious. We ate every bite!
My husband also got the Bhai Cider with his meal and said it complemented perfectly.",1
4,"It's always a good sign when an Indian friend raves about an Indian restaurant.  A friend from NY was in town and thought it was a good opportunity to check out this place since it's in a central location.  My friend recommended the street kitchen over the dining room - but wish you were able to interchangeably order from both menus but anyways...
I started out with the Hakka Chili Paneer and Papri Chaat.  I really enjoyed the paneer.  I think I could just order that with a side of rice for dinner and be really content.  The papri chaat was really good - my friend says it proper punjabi!  It feels a bit on the heavier side with all the yogurt and stuff but none the less very tasty.
I had the curried chickpeas whilst my friend had the curry fish and we shared a roti basket - which had a variety of 3 different kinds of roti (stuffed, plain).  More than enough food.  
If you're missing indian snacks and don't want to go all the way out to Tooting or Southall to pick 'em up, they sell Indian snacks at the entrance - such as masala flavoured crisps!",1
1,Good food but very spicy and it is premade and they cannot alter anything on the menu to decrease the level of heat/ spice.  One of the people in our party never got her main entree.  They never brought it,-1
5,"This is actually two different restaurants at the same location.  I have been here three times over the last weeks. The first time, there was no seating available in the upper street-cafe area, so I went downstairs to the fairly traditional British Indian restaurant. Despite it being his first night on the job, service was good, with his mentor following-up to make certain all was done correctly.  I had a simple chicken curry and a pepper/whiskey drink.  They did not ask how spicy I wanted  the curry and it was tasty, buy no heat.  Very adequate.
On the next two occasions I sat upstairs, which is much more casual, with small-plate style menu.  My favorite dish is the warm pepper salad (sorry, I have forgotten the name) with fried Paneer.  It is wonderfully hot and flavorful. I also enjoy the ""Chicken Lollipops"" with mint chutney.  It is loud and boisterous.  Highly recommend the top area for a good casual meal.",1
4,"FINALLY!! Had heard about Roti Chai from friends. We sat on the Main floor, the Street Food Corner, as suggested by our friends. The chaats are the best. Had chicken lollipop and Hakka chilli paneer which were fantastic and spicy. Also had tasty Railway Lamb Curry. The cherry on the cake was the Pistachio Kulfi - creamy, refreshing and yummy! If you are bored of the usual Indian food, this place can be a good change to your taste-buds.",1
4,"Came back to back nights. Was seated in the dining room (had reservations). Great atmosphere, great food, great cocktails. The dining room allows babies but no high chairs or strollers. The casual dining area does allow strollers, but doesn't take reservations and you'll be waiting a bit if you show up during typical dining hours.",1
4,"Came here to eat the street food, but due to it being busy we had to eat downstairs in the dining room. Food was nice, but I very much doubt the 16hour lamb was cooked for 16 hours.
Staff friendly, deserts good- but, I think the Mali cheesecake was just a dense cheesecake. Overall, very good value for money. 
Would eat here again, and I look forward to trying the street food.",1
4,"My friend and I had dinner here (upstairs) on a Wednesday night. To start off - the ambience is a bit harsh (too many harsh lights etc. ). 
The food itself is quite good - we had the chicken and lamb curries as mains which were quite tasty. For starters we had pani puri and papdi chat - these were a bit disappointing. Didn't have the zing that chaat is supposed to have. 
All in all - decent Indian food that isn't too greasy and isn't too expensive.",1
5,"There are two levels -- the Street Kitchen and Dining Room (downstairs) -- and each has a completely different menu so be sure to peruse them before deciding where you want to dine (by the way, they offer more than what the menus online indicate).  We decided on the more casual Street Kitchen.
There is a featured cocktail of the month, which was a Lychee Teapot Martini when we went in July.  We didn't order it, opting instead for:
* MAHA MOJITO - Made with ginger, mint and a rum blend, it was fine, but nothing of note. 
* KOVALAM BEACH - This one was a non-alcoholic cocktail made with ginger ale, lychee, guava and coconut.  It was pretty good, but the best one was... 
* COCONUT AND GUAVA BELLINI SHARBAT - Amazing!  Subtle, sweet and very refreshing.  We definitely had another.  It was easily the best drink we had during our entire trip to London!
There is also a seasonal special featured on the menu.  When we went they were showcasing the MANCHURIAN, a classic dish which they describe ""was created by Nelson Wang in Mumbai in 1975 and involves a traditional Indian sauce made with ginger, garlic and chilis but finished with dark soy sauce rather than garam masala to create a unique flavour.""  We ordered the CHICKEN MANCHURIAN.  It came with a bowl of steamed rice.  Very akin to adobo dishes I've had.  Good, but not the best thing we had.  The portions are on the small side on the street level, but are still shareable.  We also ordered:
* RAILWAY LAMB CURRY - Lamb and potatoes served with two chapatis.  Our server offered to substitute rice for the chapatis.  I declined but eventually ordered a side of rice anyhow to soak up some curry.  Yummy.  I preferred this one to the Manchurian.
* SAMOSAS - We chose the spicy pea and potato samosas.  You get two of them, plus chickpeas and dipping sauces.  A tad on the dry side but generally still a good choice.
yelp.com/user_local_phot…
* TARKA DHAL - Yellow lentils.  Delicious.  Must have rice or something to eat this with.
* CHICKEN LOLLIPOPS - This was our favorite dish!  You get five of these Moreish Keralan spiced chicken wings and a dipping sauce.  So good!  We almost (almost) ordered another, but as it was we had already over-ordered and this place is not cheap.
yelp.com/user_local_phot…
* Side of ROTI - Good by itself and topped with dhal, curry, etc.

5,"Oh man literally my favorite Indian street food place in London (maybe even outside of India?!?). The food is so creative , and I love the decor and ambience of the restaurant. It's just absolutely perfect! And the spicy szichuan paneer is SO GOOD. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I can't stop myself from going here again And again !!",1
5,"It's a very good Indian restaurant, between Marble Arch and Bond Street (central line).
I tried it with 6 friends on January 2016 at dinner: excellent food and service.
Good modern atmosphere (not the traditional atmosphere of most of the restaurant for tourists).
Interesting price",1
5,"Great food and service, i love this place. 
Tried lamb and chicken biryanis and they are so good. I think it's the best indian restaurant around the area.
The orange cake is delicious",1
5,"Top notch Indian food in Mayfair area. This restaurant is kind of hidden on a back street but it is well known by locals. I have not had to make a reservation when going for lunch but am unsure about dinner. There is ample room upstairs and a huge downstairs area which they probably open up for overflow.
This is a child friendly spot with high chairs and pram parking. 
Now for the food... It's AMAZING! Everything I've ordered has been delicious. My husband and I went here when I was pregnant and ordered the hot wings to try and induce labour. While it didn't work, the hotness level was intense! We both have high tolerance for spice so this was prefect for us!",1
4,"We were only in London for a week, and ended up eating here twice... once upstairs and once downstairs.
The concept is great... indian street food.
The decor is great... downstairs looks like the inside of a train, with the overhead compartments, etc.... and the upstairs reminds me of a market area.
Service was also great both times.
Downstairs is a more formal area, where you can make reservations.  Upstairs has a more cafe type feel to it, and does not accept reservations.
The menu is different in both spots.  Downstairs is more meals, and upstairs is more focused on snack items.  Both were great, but my preference was definitely the downstairs menu... but only marginally.  Food was excellent either way.
Downstairs, i think we ordered almost all of the appetizers.  My favorite was the shrimp, and also the kebabs.  Upstairs,  the best was the lamb burger, but we also had 10 different items.  the only thing i was disappointed in was the chicken wings.  Didn't have too much to it.... and seemed really mild and plain compared to the rest of the meal.
Love Indian food in London, and this place did not disappoint.",1
5,"Best Indian food I've ever had! 
I'm from Germany but I'm going to fly to London only for this restaurant. 
Love it!",1
5,Great dinner for my wife and myself. Food was exceptional and staff was very attentive. Enjoyed our first evening visiting London.,1
5,"Everything my mom and I ordered was absolutely amazing and from the moment we walked in every person working was beyond kind and helpful! Our server Veronika was not only attentive, but she was also a great guide towards what to order and was incredibly kind. For dinner we had the Hakka Chili Paneer (very spicy and flavorful,) vegetable samosas (more so mild but good,) chicken samosa chaat (WOW! So decadent and yummy,) the pulusu chicken (decadent,) and last but certainly not least the duck porridge. The duck porridge was by far the favorite item and despite being full I nearly devoured the whole bowl. The duck meat is minced and is absolutely fantastic. I am not usually a duck eater, but this porridge has won me over! Definitely give it a try. For dessert we finished off our wondrous meal with a mango kulfi and a pistachio kulfi, which was the perfect end to a fantastic meal.",1
5,"I have been going to Roti Chai for a couple of years, but just getting around to writing this review. It is a very authentic indian experience, without the strong smells. The main floor is indian street food (recommended), while the basement is a bit more formal (although I have never eaten there). 
My suggestion is to try out a few items family style from the vibrant and diverse menu. Everything is worth trying (bun kebab, chicken lollipops, papri chaat, railway lamb and chicken pulusu) are all unique and tasty. If you like to try a fancy drink, I suggest trying their special martini. I forget the name but its pinkish, served cold in a kettle and very obvious when you look at the menu.",1
5,Amazing food! We stop by because of the Yelp reviews. Our last night in London and we got lucky with a table available downstairs. Everything was really good. Prawns appetizer TOP TOP !!!,1
4,Authentic street food. Fun vibe. You'll always see a lot of desis here which is a good sign! :),1
4,"Excellent food. I wish they had this in nyc!  We loved the appetizer and buns and the entrees were delic!  There's so many atypical dishes that u have to come back & try again. It's definitely worthwhile. We tried fire wings, chat, and chicken bits for appetizer. Also had the chicken bun & fish curry. All delic! The masala chai was authentic.  Yummy!",1
3,"My wife and I walked into roti chai with a lot of high expectations because last year we were here, it was fantastic.
We were seated straightaway but it took sometime for a waiter to come and talk to us.
We ordered two masala chais. two pani puris and a fentiman's rose lemonade.
The pani puris were very good and felt very well on the palate. The pani had the correct amount of tang, sweetness and hotness to it.
The masala chai, however was a disappointment. it felt more like someone had boiled some hot water in a hurry with a tea bag and a drop of milk in it. I mean, an establishment called roti chai serves a deplorable chai and that's a bit ironic.
Nevertheless, 3 stars for a good pani puri, quick seating and decent customer service.",-1
4,"The hostess definitely saved the day for us.  We had to wait a very long time, and then after being seated nobody even came by for about 10 minutes.  She noticed and came to take our orders.  She's definitely the heroine of this establishment!
We had a bun chilli chicken which was amazing!  Full of flavor and just unlike anything we've ever had.  The chicken lollipops were decent too.  Ironically, the lamb curry was the worst part of the meal.  It was not very good.  Also I wouldn't spend the money on chai tea, it wasn't anything special. 
I'd definitely come again, but just for that sandwich!  It's going to haunt my dreams!",1
5,"Outstanding Indian Food.
Delicious!!!
Recommended to my GF and I by the friends we were staying with...  We walked there, waited a few minutes, its casual...
Also, there are 02 restaurants here so don't get confused..  01 upstairs, 01 downstairs.
We went to the one upstairs!
Everythang was extremely yummy.
If/when back in the area I would def go again.
And definitely I recommend!!!",1
5,I have only eaten upstairs and not really sure if I would try the more upscale experience downstairs. If you like Indian food - you are going to find Chicken Tiki Masala here... this is Indian Street Food and so glorious! Come with friends and order a bunch of different things - you can't go wrong!,1
5,"I have absolutely nothing to complain about. Very cool two story setup. Tapas upstairs, sit down restaurant situation downstairs. We opted for a sit down meal. Very prompt and friendly service. Varied menu options and an abundance of cocktail and wine options. The food was prepared very well. Incredibly delicious. The prices were more than reasonable. I will be returning whenever I'm in the area.",1
4,"I've been to Roti Chai twice. Once for dinner downstairs with a friend and again this week upstairs for a big group dinner. I can now attest to Roti Chai's excellent food and recommend them for large parties too.
When I booked our table we were given the option of four menus, two for upstairs (street kitchen) and two for downstairs (dining room). I liked the casual feel of the street kitchen upstairs and preferred the menu there too.
Our party of ten started with the Hakka chilli paneer, tandoori chicken pao and the aloo papri chaat. 
Normally not a fan of paneer, this version was spicy (thanks to the fresh chillies), wonderful and nothing like any paneer I've sampled. I think I had thirds. 
The tandoori chicken pao might seem like some fusion creation but small bun sandwiches like these are served all over India (particularly in Mumbai where they're a ubiquitous street food). 
Whilst I thoroughly enjoyed them all, my favourite of the starters was the aloo papri chaat - a flavor explosion brought to you by chickpeas, yoghurt and chutney and something hard to find in my neck of the woods. 
Overall, I liked the starters slightly better than the mains during our dinner.
The standout among the entrees for me was the rustic Punjabi chicken curry. The new-to-the-menu duck leg was also a standout (especially its accompanying sauce).
 
For dessert almost all of us had the mango kulfi. (I mean, who doesn't love ice cream on a stick?)
 
Service was uneven at best (seems most of the staffers were on their first or second shifts) but that didn't but a damper on our meal at all. We got everything we ordered and it arrived in a mostly timely manner.
I'd definitely go back to Roti Chai with a big group.",1
5,"First class Indian food - at least to my clumsy American palate - and clever spiced cocktails that tend toward the sweet side.  The duck is the clear winner here, but the starters were fine all the way around.
Service could use a refresher course, but I don't really care when the food is this good.",1
4,"I went a little weak at the knees over a Roti Chai lamb bun at the Feast food fair earlier this year, so I was pretty excited to try out the actual restaurant. In case you were wondering, the name means the equivalent of Bread & Tea - but fear not, there's a lot more interesting stuff on the menu!
Step 1 - Find it: It's tucked away on a quiet street behind Bond Street tube, which reminded me I should never walk down Oxford St and ought to do more exploring around it. The ground level street kitchen of colourful Indian signs and posters is kept for walk-ins (or bookings of at least 6), so we'd booked a table for 4 in the more formal downstairs Dining Room to be on the safe side. When we arrived though there was plenty of room in the brightly buzzing Street Kitchen, and as we were after a more casual meal they were happy for us to move up (I got the feeling this happens a lot).
Step 2 - Drink: Not to be overlooked - it's an Indian restaurant that actually serves more beers than just Tiger/Cobra! Though I was having a girly girl moment and chose the most flowery thing on the menu with my friend - a rose and lychee martini for two, that arrived in a teapot with 2 baby glass tumblers. I found it a bit weak and there was a lot of ice in the pot, though the novelty cuteness factor carried it. The cartons of Frooti mango juice were also nice to see (just don't think about the mark-up). They do an ok job of the masala chai too, so end with that to aid digestion!
Step 3 - Eat: We went for the lots-of-smaller-dishes-to-share option, which is clearly the way to go here. Staples like the bhel puri and papri chaat are done well, and definitely try something in a bun (both meat and veg options got a thumbs up). Meanwhile the hakka chilli paneer was my tastebuds' fave, though the paneer-to-veg-ratio needs tweaking as I got a bowlful of spring onions back after making the mistake of offering it to others first. We ended up ordering a second round of our favourites, though it takes a while to flag down a server so do this as soon as you're running low. Overall have to say I wasn't wowed as there's a few things that could easily be better, but it was all flavoured well and quite authentic.
Step 4 - Repeat as required :)",1
4,"I don't often go to Indian restaurants in London. Maybe it's because I prefer my mother's cooking. Or maybe it's because I'm almost always invariably disappointed. But not this time. After reading the reviews, decided to book this place for a friend's going away dinner.
First of all, the place looks amazing (see the pics that I posted). The ground floor has the street food menu, and has a really nice feel to it. I wouldn't say authentic, because emulating the streets of Kolkata is neigh impossible. However there is an attention to detail that makes you feel like you're travelling to another place, another destination. I didn't eat off the street food menu however, and headed straight downstairs to the main restaurant, which is tastefully decorated and a bit posher than the ground floor restaurant.
I was immediately surprised to see that they had Sam Adams Boston lager on the menu.... a first for me in anIndian restaurant. For once, I ordered that instead of the standard issue King Fisher beer.
For starters, we had the Gilafi seekh kebab, the Bengali crab and fish cake, the Chicken 65 (a variant on Indian indo-chinese food), and okra. It was all very good, although the favourites were clearly the fish cake and the chicken 65. The chicken was super crispy and perfectly cooked, and the hot sauce that it is served with is addictive! One thing that I immediately noticed was that they are not afraid to turn on the heat. The food here is definitely spicy! 
For the mains, we ordered the Saagwala gosht (lamb curry with spinach), the awadhi lamb rack, the pork belly, and for me, what was essentially the star of the evening, the Kerala duck roast. Let's talk about that duck for a second. I was very worried when I ordered it, because the menu speaks of a duck confit served with a Kerala tangy/spicy sauce. Now I know my duck confit. I make this stuff about once a month for my friends. I'm super picky about how crispy the skin should be, and how easily the meat must fall of the bone when served. Let me just say that they cooked that duck leg perfectly. And the garnish of carrots, the sauce was absolutely divine. Now this is a diwali special, and I don't know how long this dish will stay on the menu, but if you get the chance, do yourself a favour and order it.
The sides and garnishes were good, but not over the top amazing. We had the veg kulcha, and the roti, which was good, but hardened pretty quickly and was a bit too dry. The tarka dahl was good, and it was refreshing to see this served. It was spicy and had a decent amount of garlic in it!
We skipped dessert and ordered the Masala chai which was excellent. Not too sweet, and perfect balance of cardamom and sweetened condensed milk!
All in all, it came down to about 30£ per person. Won't break the bank, but don't expect a brick lane tab. This is Marylebone.
I have to agree with the other reviews about the service. It needs more attention to detail, follow up and diligence. But hey, at least it's not rude,just a bit lazy. The food makes up for this, which is why him giving them 4 stars.
I will definitely make plans to go back. Roti chai, together with Trishna (in the same vicinity), have fast become my favourite Indian restaurants in this city.",1
5,"Really loved this place.  The paneer salad was amazing.  Shocking in a sense that it was sort of a fusion of Chinese inspiration with Indian...I could be totally wrong, but that was the take I got.  Highly recommend getting it!   The Chai was great too as was the service and the prices",1
5,"Conveniently located for a quick business/shopping lunch just off Oxford street, this place offers good food and good value for your money.
I only tried the upstairs ""eatery"" for lunch, not the downstairs area, a proper restaurant where you can try more refined/elaborated stuff. 
Upstairs you can try some typical Indian street food and some traditional mains with a creative touch. I was delighted to find one of my favourite street snacks: pani puri, that's something you don't get in restaurants. It's some spheric, hollow crackers which you fill with a deliciously seasoned ""water"" and then eat in one gulp.
The other stuff I tried was very good too, even if the mains were a bit ""rushed"" perhaps, but after all this is a quick eatery not a 3 star restaurant.
I like the interior design, sleek yet cosy, with all those colourful Indian billboards.",1
3,"OK yet forgettable Indian. Had a couple of similar fried chicken dishes, a tiny pani puri, a fine lamb curry, and a nicely presented patri chaat. The best part of the meal was my Beaverton Neck Oil IPA from a local London brewery. I can't see myself going back here, so three stars feels about right.",-1
4,"Very crazy and disorganized! 
The upstairs area is very informally set, and they have really cool decorations on the wall. The menus are laid out on the table when you're seated. 
If you're looking for butter chicken, this isn't the place to go! However if you're looking for a wide variety of Indian foods from across the continent then roti chai is a great place to check out. Their roti selection is pretty good - some naan, chipatis, and a couple of very good bean stuffed roti that I couldn't identify. The only paneer dish they had was ridiculously spicy in a good way - if you want spicy food it's definitely the dish to try. The trio of chutneys is also good, and their cucumber yogurt tastes cool without being too overwhelmingly yogurt-y. 
Main complaint is probably the organization. We went on a pretty busy night, and they just seemed like they were crazy understaffed. After the waiter took out order, three other waiters came and tried to take our order again. Additionally, people kept bringing things to our table that we hadn't ordered. We were also charged for still water when we ordered tap, and it took them 15 minutes to get us another order of roti. Service is quite slow if you consider that everything is premade. The staff just seemed like quite a mess, but they were gracious and quick when it came to correcting mistakes. 
Worth coming to! Pretty delicious food.",1
4,"Tucked away behind the craziness of Oxford St is Roti Chai. There are two dining options which include the street food upstairs and the more formal dining room downstairs. We opted for the dining room this time around but would love to try the upstairs.
The pork belly and chicken tikka were the best items! Super flavorful and juicy, we loved every bite. We were a bit disappointed in the small naan portions but overall it was a great meal. Excellent and fast service as well!

5,"We (Americans from Colorado) visited Roti Chai (Downstairs Dining Room) during a family trip to London (including three kids and grandparents). 
Monday night offered a fixed menu with 2-course (£19) and 3-course (£22) options. For a starter, the Malai Chicken Tikka was excellent. This is my favorite Indian dish, and they knocked it out of the park. We all agreed that we would have preferred this as our main course. There were four adults, so we shared our courses family style.
Roti Chai has two distinct dining areas, each with its own menu. The ""Street Kitchen"" is on the ground floor (sometimes referred to as ""upstairs"") and offers items such as Chicken Lollipops and Samosas, which were not available in the Downstairs Dining Room. I actually like concept, as it provides yet another reason to come back.
Also, we chose this restaurant, in part because some reviews indicated this was a good place for kids. This might be true for the Street Kitchen. However, if you have kids and are eating Downstairs: It might be worth instructing the server to bring out all of your courses at once. There was some confusion about when we were finished with our first course, and this needlessly added at least half an hour to our dining time (which can be tenuous with a five year old).
Overall, the Best Indian Food that we have ever had. The Chicken Tikka was amazing (try to get it as your main course).",1
5,"Excellent food, we ordered a variety of dishes all of which were received with great satisfaction .  Portions slightly on the small size but not humbling small.  Cannot wait to try this one again.
Thank YELP for being spot on with 4.5 stars.",1
4,Good place which is perfect for dates or for larger groups - the bar had a great selection of drinks (reasonably priced) and the food was tasty.,1
3,I had a good experience at this restaurant. It had a nice atmosphere and the food was good. They ran out of the beer I wanted to try and that was a small disappointment. The food was good but the menu was small. My Indian dish was a chicken curry. There was too much ginger in it and it made for a spicy but not so tasty combination.  Overall it was good and i would probably go back.,-1
4,"Had a great meal here. I definitely recommend the ""Chicken lollipops"", which were basically crispy deep fried chicken legs. Everything else was top notch too - you'll probably want to order a number of small dishes and eat family style. After all, sharing is caring. Certainly a good place for lunch, as it was busy but not too crazy. Probably worth booking ahead though.",1
2,"Food is okay. The hostess needs to be a lot more organized... She kept us waiting for almost 30 minutes, and when I saw that a table had been kept open I finally inquired about it (thinking there's no way she would keep us waiting when that table is ours). As a matter of fact, she HAD forgotten about us! Space is chill and cool though.",-1
2,"Great in theory...poor in practice!
I should have known that something was wrong when I saw that not a single patron, server or chef was Indian. While the menu screams of the promise delivered by authentic Indian street food delights, the reality is that you end up with deep fried chicken and bland, watered down colored sauces masquerading as spices.
What is really shocking is that people pay so much money to stomach not just the poor excuse for food but the pollution and congestion around Oxford street as well.
My advice, find the place the local Indian people frequent to find real Indian food. And avoid this tourist trap like the plague!",-1
3,"Indian Street food with lovely decor throughout. 
Food was good, wish I knew what to order. I had a rice dish that was a bit unexpected,  Felt a bit like a fish out of water with the cuisine but we did the best we could. 
I would definitely try this again for a better pov. 
Service could use some work. I sat around for a total of about 40 min waiting for service to bring menus, to order drinks, to order and a long time for the check.",-1
4,"Great dining experience! Had dinner around 8:30 at the bottom level (there are separate menus for the two levels; the top level is more street food/tapas-like and crowded in terms of seatings, with a slighter friendlier range of prices; the bottom level has that dimmer lighting, nice restaurant atmosphere). Was taken away by the butter chicken and the house special lamb! Flavorful seasoning and extremely tender meat. Would actually prefer to eat here with friends compared to Punjab!",1
5,"What can I say guys... Yelp did not disappoint with this place. It's basically an Indian tapas place so sharing is a must for the best experience. I dined at both the upstairs (street-style) and downstairs (restaurant) two days in a row. That's saying something...
I guess I'll just list what I enjoyed from both since my group tried a whole ton of stuff.
Street Kitchen (upstairs)--
Hakka Chilli Paneer - Mmmm... fantastic and comes with a lot of veggies.
Parsi Chicken Farcha - Pieces of breaded chicken with a wonderful dipping sauce.
Manchurian Chicken - Get this!!
Hot Wings - Damn I forget the exact name, but I know it started with an 'A', anyways, you need to try them, because they're spicy and amazing!
**Tried the Chicken Lollipops & thought they were whatever... nothing special there.
Dining Room (downstairs)--
Szechuan Chilli Paneer - on skewers and are delicious!
Prawn Curry - Forget the name, but this was my favorite menu item! The sauce is to die for!
Chicken 65 - Very similar to the Parsi Chicken Farcha upstairs
Pork Ribs - not bad, a little dry for my taste because I like ribs saucy.
Pork Belly - I'm not a huge fan but my friends really liked it.
**Gilafi Seekh Kebab - if you like lamb, you might like this. I do not.
Roti Chai has really good food and service isn't half bad either. Get the Chai Tea! I couldn't get enough of it. Unfortunately, it only comes by the glass. If you can, try both the upstairs and the downstairs, you can't go wrong either way!",1
2,"I had heard about Roti Chai through a friend of mine who had nothing but rave reviews for the restaurant. Many months later, I finally get the chance to try it... And am completely and totally underwhelmed.
When I got there, I had no idea there was an option of upstairs vs downstairs dining, and that the menus would be different depending on where you were seated. It was only after placing my order for banana chips and lamb curry did I find out about the dining room, where it seems there is a more extensive menu - and perhaps more satisfying dishes because I, personally, did not enjoy my dinner.
It was ok, and nothing more. Neither of the dishes I ordered were anything to write home about, and the service - while attentive - lacked personability (as if my waiter was only there in body, going through the motions). 
I may give this place another chance, based solely on the rave reviews it's getting for its dining room menu... but Im certainly in no rush to go back anytime soon.",-1
4,Really great Indian street food concept. I would say that the food is better than Dish00m although the service is a bit slow and the restaurant is a bit cramped. I love the Indian movie posters and paraperhanlia/memerobilia dressed in garish colors. Throw-back to the dhaba restaurants that dot the highways in India.,1
5,"I have been to this restaurant several times, one of the best restaurants near the Oxford Street.
Railway lamb curry deserves a trt",1
4,"We visited Roti Chai because we were starving after battling the Boxing Day crowds, it was raining, and we needed a place near Selfridges. This place fit the bill.
The Ambiance: This restaurant is cute...reminiscent of modern Indian.  The place is spotless and lively.
The Food: My absolute favorite thing was the Fruit Chaat. Covered in Tamarind chutney, this was top notch (and I know my fruit chaat). We also had Idli Sambar (just okay) and my husband had a chicken dish. Can't remember the name of it but he wasn't too thrilled with the chicken quality. The Naan was also amazing...he plowed through 5 pieces.
The Service: Super busy place and overworked servers. They are nice and they do try but I think Roti Chai could stand to hire a few more people.
The Prices: Decent. Especially for the area.
The Bottom Line: I might come back on another trip...the fruit chaat is calling my name.",1
1,I would give this place 0 stars if possible. The food was subpar and the service was terrible. Not an authentic experience.,-1
4,"Why I ended up at Roti Chai is the perfect example of why I love Yelp. After a 5 hours shopping marathon around Oxford Street I was really hungry. I didnt know any restaurants in the area, I was loaded with shopping bags and I needed food. Now. So I checked Yelp for restaurants in that area and Roti Chai popped up amongst some others. The rating looked really good so I took a quick look at the reviews. Turns out, one of my friends just ate here a couple of weeks ago and left fabulous 5 stars for the place. Done deal, thats where Im going, I thought.
And it was a great decision. Staff was really friendly, the food came fast and steaming hot and made my belly a happy camper! I went for the Hakka chilli paneer (pretty hot!) and another dish, but I cant think of the name. Both choices were great and just what I was craving. I would definitely recommend this place. Upstairs is the ""street dining area"" (more for a quick meal and cheaper prices) downstairs you have a different menu and more of a restaurant feeling. Go check it out!",1
4,"Really great Indian food that was tasty and very filling! We ate in the Street Kitchen area and the atmosphere was really relaxed.
We opted for the chicken lollipop and Chilli Paneer. The sauce for the lollypops was nice and refreshing and the chilli paneer was super delicious! It was really refreshing and spicy at the same time and the paneer tasted super fresh.
For mains we got the fish curry and the pulusu curry. The fish curry was nice, a little bland though. The pulusu curry was delicious! Really nice flavours. We also ordered a side of aloo gobi which set the meal off perfectly.
Tasty food, nice people, good atmosphere... will defo be back!",1
5,"Doing some business in London and stopped in with a colleague.  It's a place that gives you two very different dining options.  Street food upstairs in the kitchen or a more traditional dinning room below.  After a long day of walking around the city we opted for the quieter options downstairs.
My first take on the menu is here is a place butting their best foot forward with 7 or 8 small plates and the same number of larger dishes.  As for the openers, the dumplings with chili sauce were great.  Fresh chillies with just enough bite and a rich smokey flavor.  On the large dish side was a chicken dish in a butter sauce.  The chicken was tender, flavorful and slow cooked.  The butter sauce would make even my mother's food taste good (sorry mom).
The menu varies and I wish we had something like this in the states close to me.  A great take.",1
4,"Food is extremely tasty. Ordered the butter chicken, tarka daahl,  palak paneer, and gosht. The lamb was amazing, it was tender and flavorful. The raita was good although portions were slightly small. Restaurant is aesthetically appealing and lively. Would've liked service to be better. None the less, would return.",1
5,We had a wonderful dinner. Food was great and service was very nice. There's no take away so order accordingly.,1
4,Food was very good but service was lacking. The waiter brought the food but didnt check back for a long time.  The restaurant was soooo noisy...not their fault. Overall good restaurant.,1
5,"Authentic Indian food served in an inviting atmosphere.  Try the daily specials or simply ask your server for advise, they're very knowledgeable and friendly.",1
5,"I was in London for a two week business trip and made it my quest to target the highest rated Indian restaurants near SoHo and ended up at Roti on the last night.  This place is very popular and seems to have crowds arrive in waves, but I walked in after 9:30 pm.
 I anticipate this will change as the season warms up and i may be completely wrong on a weekend.  You can make a meal of the appetizers by sampling through each of them and for main i tried the Saagwala gosht ( lamb) and Koliwada fish.  This will be on my todo when I return to UK.",1
4,"Yelp has done me right again: this place was awesome!  Went for lunch which was the street kitchen menu (the dining room is closed during the day).  It was a little empty at 12:30pm but we were super hungry so we settled in.  Not 20 minutes later, the place was full of locals (mostly business lunches, it looked like) who knew this was some good food!
I had aloo gobi which was deliciously spicy. I had to order the roti (bread) afterwards to dampen the spice but in a great way! My friends loved their meals as well (one was fried chicken bites with a lovely sauce, another had chickpeas and chai tea). 
Big recommendation!",1
5,"Great Indian in London! 
Tasty food, perfect portions and superb service! 
Don't miss chicken samosas, spicy cashews, and there's a rice plate with vegetables and raita that was spectacular!",1
3,"Okay food; tried chicken, lamb and aloo gobi; appetizer section was larger than entrees; seems like a casual appetizer place more than a serious food place.",-1
5,"The Roti Chai was beyond our expectations, which were very high based on the Yelp reviews. Every dish we had was well spiced, but not overwhelming and absolutely delicious. We have never had such an amazing Indian meal.
We ate in the downstairs section (restaurant), which was very pleasant, full of folks but it did not feel crowded.  The menu will work for vegetarians as well as meat/fish folks like us. 
Service was excellent - prompt, polite, and attentive. Th chai tea that my wife ordered at meal's end was simply too good!  Put any negative reviews you might occasionally read here and trust what I'm telling. You will NOT be disappointed.",1
4,"My friends love this place. I'm not so sure. The food is very very good but it isn't the best in London. The service is good for small groups. I didn't have perfect service with a large group - which is super hard to do - but would recommend. Defo in the top 20 Indians in London, just not my favourite.",1
4,"We happen to visit this Indian fusion when another restaurant didn't serve lunch nearby, and we were happy we did.  Authentic Indian chai tea, amazing Chicken Samosa Chaat with yogurt topping was my favorite. The others ordered the Parsi Chicken Farcha (chicken masala) that resembles chicken nuggets with chutney sauce that was ordered again and again by the younglings.  We also tried the Pulusu chicken and Manchurian chicken, but was so so.",1
5,"I was around Edgware road and was looking for something to eat with no idea what to choose. Surrounded by Lebanese Shisha restaurants, I was looking for absolutely anything else. Step in Yelp Nearby and after a short search (this place is hidden!) I was sure this place was gonna be good based on the street menu and the wonderfully inviting warmly lit close quarters street dining experience on the ground floor. 
There are two menus here, and it appeared at least to me that most people were here for the street menu. You have amazing starters, from potato chips with yoghurt and pomegranates, chicken lollipops with cool mint yoghurt sauce and even better mains like Railway Lamb and Pulusu Chicken you'll leave here extremely stuffed, full and happy. It's not often I leave Indian restaurants happy with the quality of each and every dish, or the quality of the cooking or meat choices, but everything here was A quality. The dishes are all perfect for sharing, but the Pulusu chicken which I ordered was amazingly soft and tender and very good quality.
In all, there were 3 of us, we ordered 3 drinks, starters, mains and desserts. The final bill came to £21 per head incl. tax. Quality food, atmosphere, great staff (apart them forgetting my request for water 3 times and delivering this to other tables nearby). This is my fave indian restaurant in London and hopefully it can remain on the down-low for some time before you'll need a reservation to eat here.
There is a dining menu too downstairs which I may try some time too, but that didn't seem as popular.",1
5,"During the visit in London, I was looking for a trendy spot to dine in because that's what I love to do when I travel: go to places I can't back home. Being in SF definitely has its perks and standards. So when I stumbled upon this place with Timeout, I was excited. 
I knew I was going to enjoy my time here even though the pub next door was packed with people on the sidewalk beer in hand having a good time. 
We sat in the street level part of the restaurant which served ""street food""
We ordered a fish curry, lamb curry, and chicken curry. Each curry came with it's own starch; rice or bread. The portions are perfect there but being from America we were used to eating a little bit more so I ordered a side of Roti. I was surprised that 3 pieces cut in half came in a basket and even more surprised when they were different kinds! 
Ambiance was wonderful there was a lot to look at and take in.",1
4,"Roti Chai is one of those places that make me thankful I'm a Yelper. I've seen them at Yelp events and tried a couple dishes from them which were consistently good, so when I was in the area I jumped on the opportunity to go.
It was a Friday night so it was packed but since it was only 2 of us we got a seat in around 10 minutes. The ground floor is more of a tapas/street food style restaurant and the downstairs is more classic Indian fare. From what it sounds like the street food is much busier, and for good reason.
We decided to get a bunch of plates and bread to share, and everything we ate was delicious. I'd particularly recommend the bhel puri (one of my favourites) and the aloo gobi with roti. All the dishes were of a nice size especially for the price, about on par with a reasonably priced Spanish tapas restaurant, maybe a bit less even. We also had their special Pimms which had rose lemonade in it and was really tasty.
Also of note, they have a nice amount of vegetarian options, so go crazy, veggies!",1
3,"An interesting little eatery with cheerful staff and a colourful decor. Great to pop in after work and grab a quick meal, not great for groups or a long evening meal.",-1
4,"My husband and I were very much looking forward to having Indian food in London.  Our first place was Roti Chai downstairs, the more formal dining area downstairs.  
We shared the paneer and fish and crab cakes appetizers.  He got butter chicken and I got the spinach curry lamb.  Each got different kinds of bread.
Our take is that food was good but quite pricey (60 British pounds).  We are from New York and probably have had better Indian for less money.  But hey, that's what happened when you're on vacation and it was Boxing Day when only a few restaurants were open.  So it was a decent experience all in all.",1
4,"Came here for dinner for a special occasion (My wife's birthday). So was a little bit surprised to see the street kitchen atmosphere upstairs, More Wahaca than Cinnamon Club.. I was pretty sure the website photos were different. Oh dear I think... this is not the type of place we were dressed for or what we were really expecting. Fortunately we were swiftly led downstairs to the much more upmarket dining room - Cue the Giant sigh of relief.. 
Had a great meal here. We tried a number of dishes, the Bengali Crab Fishcakes, a Paneer starter, Butter Chicken, Kozikode Prawns, Palak Paneer, and some lovely Orange and Cumin Tandoori Roti. 
Overall the food was very good, a little on the spicy side, but lovely all the same. Our Saffronic Gin and Tonics were also excellent. 
As it was my wife's birthday I was happy to see staff remembered my request for a candle lit cake at the end of our meal (I had mentioned this when I booked through Open table). This was the Cardamom and Chocolate Tart, very nice, but added to the bill all the same..
Super meal... no complaints..",1
5,"Best Indian food I have ever had, including my dear Indian friends that have cooked traditional Indian food for me. The spices were perfect, not too overpowering but just enough kick to get your taste buds excited. We had a tandoori chicken starter, Zoroastrian butternut chicken dish and also a chicken tikka with rice and garlic naan - all of which were incredible. Service was decent, a bit slow but the staff was very pleasant so we didn't mind. 
I might try to convince my husband to return again before we head back to the states.",1
5,"Roti Chai. Yes. Best indian street food I have tried hands down!
I'm not the most adventurous when it comes to food, so I stuck to what I know and had a chicken curry and rice with some plain naan bread. It was beautiful and filled with flavour, spices and magic? Yes, definitely magic.  Also the Paneer is particularly appetizing.
Nice environment, great location just off Oxford street so convenient for a quick shopping or working lunch.",1
3,"Searching for Indian restaurants near our Marble Arch area hotel, this looked like the safest bet. We got there and were encouraged to eat at the proper restaurant downstairs. The space is very nice but the staff did feel very standoffish. While there were seats open throughout, we were seated by the kitchen. 
The food was very good but since we were in the mood for traditional Indian fare, the fusion elements were lost on us. It's also on the expensive side and for the price I regretted not going to La Porte des Indes a few blocks away.",-1
5,Just what I was looking for on a cold London night-some delicious Indian food. It was interesting in terms of flavors but if spice is a key ingredient then a must is a side of the chopped chilies. This was provided for heat to taste. I am a sucker for spice with a burn but the subtle flavors were inherent in the cooking style. I dined in the restaurant vs the street food that was offered as a tapas type food fare upstairs. Very enjoyable and I recommend asking the knowledgeable staff for a tour of the offerings. Go for it!,1
1,"Business is good and all that, but the floor manager's got a cocky attitude and basically told me ""you will get your table when your name is called"" when I asked him politely about the wait time. Left immediately without looking back.",-1
3,"Food Hunting goes to Roti Chai
After a very long week at work and university all we could think about is when we are going to get our next bite of scrumptious gol gappes and bhel puri.
Determine to try a new restaurant we hunted down Roti Chai, which we now call ""Our little box of Indian heaven"". It's located behind Selfridges making it easy to access and very convenient.
Roti Chai has two floors; the ground floor is called ""The Indian Kitchen"" where you get all the yummy Indian street food, set in a very colourful quirky yet incredibly retro Indian décor and downstairs is more of a sophisticated ""Dinning Room"" with dim lights with beautiful table arrangements.

5,"Wow!
Roti Chai, you impressed a Silicon Valley girl! 
I thought Silicon Valley had the best Indian restaurants around but Roti Chai surpassed my expectation!
This restaurant looks way more sophisticated than our normal Indian restaurants in California (after all this is Central London), so at first I was skeptical. Is this one of those over-priced places with lame food?
No! The food was full of flavor and the service was superb! The price was reasonable also!
I liked this restaurant so much I even bought their logo T-shirt!",1
5,"Best Indian food in London, IMHO. Indian Street food, so something different than you are used to. Very, very good! Moderately priced as well.",1
1,Yelp shows 11 pm close we showed up at 10:30 and were rudely turned away. Awesome customer service !,-1
3,"I can't remember how many times I've walked past this place and thought ""I should eat there one day!""..... Today was indeed that day!
The restaurant is divided into street food upstairs and more traditional downstairs. Both were busy and either choice was a 10 minute wait. We opted to go down stairs where we were politely greeted and directed to a comfortable waiting area.
Annoyingly a couple who came in after us were seated first, but upon realising their mistake we were quickly seated in a place set for 4 (we were a couple) in a bit of a hurry we immediately made our order and pleasingly it turned up quickly.
The food was ok, portions were just right. My partner always has the same thing in Indian restaurants, butter chicken. Comparatively, it was very good!! I went for a chicken dhansak, this tipped my scale at ""average"" the accompanying bread were all ""average"" also. 
To summarise,  the place is welcoming with friendly staff. The food is good but as there price point is at the higher end of what you would want to pay for the cuisine I would want a bit more. If like me you've passed it and thought you should try it..... Give it a go. (Unless your heading towards covent garden, then go to dishoom.... The place this is aspiring to be like)",-1
5,The place is nice and although it's noisy it didn't matter for me. I liked the food which mattered most for me. Chicken lollipops and chicken curry with naans were my orders and they were perfect. The food is not too spicy.,1
4,"This place is a bit off the beaten path but it is totally worth trying to get there!
There is an upstairs and downstairs at this restaurant. The upstairs is geared towards street food and smaller dishes while downstairs is a bit more formal and focuses on big mains.  My friends and I stayed upstairs and we ordered really delicious dishes.
For street food, my favourite pick is the bhel!  The puffed rice. Seriously so good!  For my main I got a fish curry.
The food was great but I knocked a star off my review because I did not find service to be spectacular.  The waiters seems a bit disorganised and it didn't seem like we had 1 person assigned to take care of us, which can be frustrating because as a patron you don't know who to speak to.  Our food order was forgotten and also we ran out of water for our table twice.
I would come back to try the lower floor's mains, but I hope they figure out a more efficient way of servicing tables,",1
1,"Horrible service! Got seated and waiter took our order, but we waited a good 20-30 min without getting any drinks or food. Tables seated after us were getting their food before us. When asking manager what happened, he was very rude and dismissive, asking us to leave if we were unhappy with the service! We left without getting our food or drinks, and every other dining experience here in London has been great up till now. Would not recommend this restaurant nor will I ever return. Good riddance!",-1
5,This place was great! Loved the layout as well as the food. Great price with helpful and friendly staff. Would define you come back.,1
4,"Was hoping to get an iced chai and found out it's only served hot (iced comes with ice cream??) Ended up getting the tarka dal and a beer. It was delicious, perfect level of spice and very quick service. I'll go for the hot chai after all...watery but has a very aromatic flavor. Very good spices.",1
4,"This place had great food, although there were not many vegetarian options for an Indian place. Excellent fish curry, rich in flavor, and very spicy. Roti was done well as well. 
Loved the mango ice cream! So rich and delicious.",1
4,"This is what I came to London for! To try real tasty Indian street food, and dishes I have never had before. I loved the casual ""Street Indian"" upstairs area. Seated next to me, were a bunch of Indian tweens who had designer handbags worth thousands, and other families with a lot of money. So you know this place had to have good Indian food. We got a variety of dishes, the starters I was not too impressed about. I would not get the chaats or the lollipop chicken, the chaats were too organized, and the lollipop chicken was just meh. Chaat salad is messy and crushed up, the way it's meant to be eaten, whereas here it's organized into a neat little bite. Fortunately, the main dishes were much better. The Pulusi chicken was really flavorful and packed a good punch, it tasted great over rice. The ground duck dish was really different, but also tasty. I've never had duck in an Indian dish before, but I had to get something I have never seen at home, and glad I did. The ground duck didn't really taste like duck, but nevertheless the spices and and the meat were delicious over rice. I wish Roti Chai was in DC, I would definitely go there again if I was in London.",1
1,"Do  not go if you expect good service. Never consider if you like great service. This is my first trip to London and based on yelp reviews, I decided to go there. I was told that there is 30 min wait. I said ok. But the guy at the front desk was least interested in taking down my name so that he can put me on the queue. Then I asked him about downstairs area. That's when he told me that there is no wait downstirs. So I went downstairs. There my family and I were seated immediately. But no one showed up to take the order. Or wasn't even offered water until I asked 4 times. 
I was getting flustered so I asked the manager to see if he can help provide better experience. But still no one offered to fill up water or came to check if I need seconds. 
Lastly no one showed up to collect the credit card for bill payment.
But they were quick to charge 12% tip/service charge.
How does this place get so much raving reviews.  Or Does the quality of service depends on skin color?",-1
5,"Fabulous -- flavorful, interesting food, traditional but with a modern twist, and drawing more widely in Indian regional and street food than your usual places. We will definitely be back!",1
5,"The Veg Samosas are delicate and perfection-- the well orchestrated blend of spices that make me actually do back flips. Alas.. wayyy to stuffed on Aloo Gobi (tender and delectable) and Roti (served piping hot) to move from my ""sprawled out on the bench"" position. I've never been to India but I bet this is better than your grandmas dishes!",1
5,"Such a great place!! I ate at their street food ground level place. Such interesting, delicious food!!",1
4,"I've eaten here twice, once upstairs in the more casual ""street kitchen"" and once downstairs in their formal dining room. The first time I was with a friend visiting from the US, and the waitstaff gamely allowed her to order, for herself, an entire 500 ml carafe of wine--hey, we don't use metric in America, so sue us! I had a very tasty, but not too strong, ginger mojito. We split an order of samosas that were exemplary of the form--definitely get them! She had Hakka chicken Manchurian and I had the lamb curry with potatoes and roti. I enjoyed her Manchurian more than I enjoyed the lamb, but I think maybe I'm just not a huge fan of lamb. It was definitely tasty, but the roti to gravy proportions were off and I would have appreciated more bread to sop everything up.
The second time, I ate downstairs with visiting family. You MUST get the shrimp curry if they have it. It is incredible. We also split the chicken 65, the seekh kebab, a fish curry, and the butter chicken, which were all very good. That was more than enough for a family of four, and I would recommend a family-style setup if you have enough people, so you can try everything. My mother and I also split a pretty epic bread pudding, and my brother loved his malai kulfi.
Roti Chai is very close to the Marble Arch tube station, but it can be hard to find for new visitors or foreign tourists. It's on a side
street that's pretty out of the way across from the Thistle hotel. Just keep looking and you will find it!",1
4,"Wanting some good Indian food while visiting London, I found Roti Chai via Yelp (where else?) while doing some research after biking through Hyde Park.  Located right off of Oxford Circle, close to the Marble Arch, it was easily accessible via metro.  When we ate a late lunch it was not crowded at all.
We opted for the street menu and ordered the Railway Lamb Curry and the Bun Tikki with a Naan sampler.  The portions are small, which would have been an issue if we were hungrier, but we were fine with what we got.  If we were doing dinner perhaps we'd have ordered more dishes.
Lamb Curry was ""off the chain"".  We searched for it everywhere afterwards.  Roti Chai is a nice option if you're tired of the touristy fish & chips!",1
5,"For what it is, it is exceptionally good, so I gave it five stars. There are, as the other reviewers note, two restaurants: a formal dining room downstairs and a more bustling street food place upstairs. We reserved downstairs, but when we saw the upstairs we opted to eat there instead. Food was delicious. Everything was fresh and hot. We had samosas to start. I've had some bad samosas in my life (rancid oil, greasy, heavy)--these were terrific: hot, tasty, fresh and, for samosas, light. We had a special chicken and lamb curry for our mains. Both fabulous. They came with rice and bread, which was nice, since some Indian restaurants tend to upsell the sides. 
Service was good and the crowd enthusiastic.
A very nice, informal experience. I'll definitely be back.",1
4,"My family and I ate at the lower level restaurant. I personally really enjoyed the curried potatoes, pork belly and butter chicken. The spicing was perfectly intense. However my Indian food novice mother found the butter chicken too spicy. If you have really sensitive taste buds this may not be the restaurant for you. 
The service was excellent when we started our meal, which was early by British standards, however it got substantially worse as the place filled up. That's the only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me.",1
4,"Charming restaurant and delicious food, although super pricey. But hey, this is London. :) I loveddddd the papri chaat and the biryani! It was beautifully presented and cooked perfectly. Yum!",1
5,"Good seevice, friendly waiters and very delicious indian food! Most meals are a bit spicy but very delicious. If you go there as a group I recommend to order some different starters to share!",1
5,"Am on a street in  Bangalore? No!  Am I riding an elephant in Mumbai? No!  I'm right here is London, home away from home for Indian Food.  Roti Chai is a indian restraunt in the heart of London specializing in regional street food in their bar area, and more sophisticated regional dishes in their downstairs main dinning room.  
All I can really say is fresh fresh Yum.  Spicy with a great kicking heat, the appetizers were only a teaser for the main courses.  (apply London accent ) Lovely Samosas, Lovely Chat Papri and Lovely Paneer... just all around Lovely ! (end London accent)
This was serious authentic and fresh indian food from selection around India.  I had the indian beer too.  Roti is located next to a pub, so go get drunk then have a curry just like the Brits do!",1
5,"When I arrived in London, I was craving Indian food.  I found Roti Chai on yelp, and had a wonderful dinner there.  There's the downstairs dining room, which is a bit fancier, than the upstairs room which is more focused on street food.  I ate at both & had great experiences in each.  Downstairs, I had the chicken tikka and it was delicious.  I would definitely go back the next time I'm in London.",1
3,"Little bit of a wait, but once I sat down the food was served quickly. Yummy and modern take on classic Indian dishes. I had the palak papri chaat. So good.",-1
5,"Second time I've come here and I absolutely love it. Good service, fast, great flavors, good proportions, price ok, The concept of tapas/Indian Food and the interieur are great, can't say much except I'm a fan!!",1
3,"We tried the chicken lollipops, bhel puri, chana, and pulusu chicken upstairs. The food was decent; nothing special. Great service.",-1
4,"I ordered a chicken curry with rice which was great, we also ordered an assortment of breads, and they were fantastic. My only criticism was that the serve of curry was quite small. 
There was a 12.5% service charge which was a bit of a surprise when we received the bill. 
I recommend this restaurant.",1
5,"Delicious! We sat upstairs in the ""street food"" diner of the restaurant ---
We had:
-chicken loli-pops
-hakka chili paneer
-pea & potato samosas
-roti with yogurt & chutneys
-pulusu chicken
& of course a glass of chai
All were absolutely delicious & full of flavor. My favorite was the hakka chili paneer ---- but everything had terrific flavor - my taste buds are slightly on fire and completely satisfied. YUM!
Will definitely return :-)",1
4,Amazing butter chicken. Very aromatic and meat was very soft. Naan bread - delicious! That's a must whenever you come there. Loved it. Good selection of drinks/cocktails. Place itself is nicely arranged so very pleasant for spending time with friends and enjoying the food. Definitely worth recommendation.,1
5,"Love this place, I have even had cravings for this specific place and trekked up to this venue from afar!
Firstly, beware that upstairs and downstairs are two different restaurants for all practical purposes and the downstairs is a fancier, pricier option which I have not tried out yet. Upstairs is a more casual dining spot (street style might be a stretch though) that attracts yuppies and busy city-folk. 
Their ambience feels less like a curry house and more a modern, clean place with sophisticated crowds and their menu is short and crisp, a far cry from the menu booklets at most Indian places. Some of their dishes on their menu are distinctive to this restaurant and must not be missed. The Hakka Chilli Paneer, as every review seems to mention, is a must-order for its distinctive kick that settles in well after the first few bites. Would also highly recommend the Idli Sambar (for those with a milder palate) and the Railway Lamb Curry (for a spicier mix). Beware that portion sizes are on the smaller end and this is not the cheapest of Indian food spots.
Full disclosure: I might be a tad biased in my opinions because the founder is an alum of my business school :) But the degree is bias is not so much that you need discount the views too much ;)",1
5,I prefer the downstairs menu.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in the world. Their chicken tikka is one of the best dishes I've ever had.,1
4,Ate downstairs. Food was very delicious but fairly small portions compared to the prices,1
4,"We went there for dinner during a working day but we had to make a reservation.
The room upstairs look more like a fast food kind of place but the room downstairs is a real restaurant.
The food was really good and the service was good. I would only regret the very busy and noisy room.",1
4,"I come to Roti Chai pretty often with my parents and it hasn't let me down yet.  I'll admit that when I initially heard about the place, I got very excited followed immediately by disappointment as it was not, in fact, a Roti Canai restaurant.  However, the food here is consistently good.  The restaurant is split into two - the upstairs section which is more geared towards Street Food, and downstairs which has slightly grander dishes (in both construction and price).
Upstairs:  came here again last night, had the Bhel Puri (mixture of crunchy puffed rice with a tamarind sauce and other goodies) and chicken lollipops for starter.  The bhel's not bad, but I prefer the one at Horn Ok Please - this one's a little sweet and misses the mix of textures that I've had in other ones.  The chicken lollipops are excellent though, they're really moreish and nicely spiced on the outside.  For mains, we had the Railway Lamb curry, pulusu chicken curry, idli sambar (vegetables and lentil curry with rice cakes) and rotis.  All the curries are good - my favourite was the pulusu chicken which had a nicely rounded spice combination; I do like that the curries aren't overly oily and I'm yet to have something here that I could define as bland or unbalanced.  The curries aren't huge by any means so you may have to order 3 between two (depending on gluttonous tendencies).  The rice/rotis are likewise smaller than you'd expect; however, I do really like the breads here - they're not greasy and they're just right (not too dry or soggy).  We had a lot of food between three here yesterday and it was still less than £20 a person.
Downstairs:  been here 3 or 4 times.  I do like the food here, but I also feel that the value for money isn't as good as upstairs.  Some of the more 'serious' curries cost in the £15-£20 range and I've not had anything that's really blown me away.  That said, I really like the orange peel naan that they do down here.  That's something pretty nice and refreshing.
Definitely a place to check out - despite its location, you can usually get a place here without too much trouble (although to be fair I mostly come here after 9pm, so don't take my word for it).  The food here is consistently decent and you won't be wanting for flavour.  It's also totally legit if you just go in and order 4 plates of chicken lollipops.  That would be wholly acceptable in my eyes.",1
5,"I eat in this restaurant for the first time last week and it was a  very good surprise.
When I'm in London, I always eat on an indian restaurant and I found this one with the goog comments on Yelp.
The food is nice, the presentation is great and the taste is like a true indian street food.
The waiters are friendly and helpfull.
I recommend this place and hope to see a Roti chai in Brussels :)",1
5,"Im obsessed with this place. I'm heartbroken i don't live in London. But when i do visit, it's my first stop after dropping my bags at the hotel. Which happens to be right across the street! 
They serve street-style indian food. Dishes you will not find at any regular Indian restaurant. They're all incredibly delish. 
I could eat the Hakka chilli paneer e v e r y d a y! I went there three days in a row on my last trip to London. Upon leaving the waiters would shout: ""See you tomorrow!""
p.s. I have an addictive personality but also really good taste.",1
4,"A Seattlite, a San Diegan, a Londoner and a mutt Singaporean walk into a yuppie Indian restaurant and order two samosas, prapi chaat, Manchurian chicken, aloo gobi, and Railway lamb curry...
The Seattlite enjoyed the aloo gobi, the San Diegan loved the chicken samosa, the Londoner loved the lamb curry and the Singaporean felt everything was decently done - save the samosas and the Manchurian chicken. 
So, what is the moral of the story? 
Don't bring the Singaporean to a yuppie Indian restaurant, because while it was all very tasty, there was too much anise / cardamom in the vegetarian samosas, the wheat flour chapati that was served with the lamb curry was too chewy and the Manchurian chicken completely out of place. 
Other than that, the lamb curry was tender, and the aloo gobi delightful. Bit pricey, but this is south Marylebone, so I can understand the reasons behind it... Atmosphere's great and the decor of the dining room downstairs was gorgeous. Definitely worth a try, but stick to what they're good, i.e. Indian. :)",1
5,We had an outstanding meal with the upstairs street food.  We ordered 8 dishes and each one was fantastic.  At the top were the chicken lollipops and the samosas.  Highly recommend.,1
5,Really KA Indian food. Outstanding - nice spot - amazing food. Everything we had was perfectly seasoned and lovely. Chicken 66 was transcendent.,1
5,"Wonderful food and great ambiance of traditional Indian flavors in a modern setting. Sit upstairs for a quicker, more casual dinner of downstairs in the dining room for a more formal one. Either way, the food is some of the best Indian food I've had in ages. The portions are not huge but the flavors are! Definitely recommend.",1
5,"This is just outstanding!  Does what it claims to do which is provide great tasting, great quality authentic  Indian street food.  Service is quiet, unobtrusive and efficient.  
Will definitely return to work my way through more of their menu",1
5,"Down an inconspicuous alley that looks like it used to be only suitable for delivery trucks...oh, wait, it is in a mews so that would make sense...this place does look a bit out of place, or just lost.
Don't let that put you off as the food and the service here are fantastic. Ever wonder about just how much hotter that 1 chilli vs the 2 chilli dish is? Just ask the waiter and he/she will be more than happy to guide you in the right direction of what you are looking for, and in some cases what you were not looking for but were happy to stumble across.
I'd write about what I ate, but I can't remember the names but do remember dipping into a couple of different things that I ordered/ was recommended and also helping myself to a chunk of every plate my eating mate had, whether he wanted me to or not, and I loved all of them. I'd just sit there, ask the waiter what they recommend and just go with that, proved to be a winning strategy for my visit.",1
5,"Amazing surprise- I thought I was going to some little Indian food hold in the wall. Instead, I found the best meal I had in London, hands down, with some exciting ambiance. I also ran into 3 co-workers while there, because of the crazy word of mouth.",1
5,"Incredible dining experience. Wonderful staff, even better food!",1
5,One of the 2 best meals that we had in London. Incredible indian food! Reservations needed.  You must definitely get the Chicken 65 appetizer! It also has a nice pub next door to grab a drink before or after dinner.,1
1,Service poor. Food okay. Nothing special. No takeaway boxes. Overall a bad experience.,-1
3,"It's interesting how a frustrating day at work often leads to us going out for dinner during the week: it's a way to let off steam and give ourselves a treat to offset the work day.  You can sit back and enjoy some good food and the beer somehow tastes nicer.
We came here for a late dinner on Tuesday night, directly from work.  It is 5-10 minute walk from Bond St station.  The restaurant has two parts: street food upstairs and a more formal restaurant downstairs. The street food option felt more like a tapas-style place to have drinks and small dishes. We chose the downstairs option because we felt like something more substantial.
We got the gilafi seekh kebab for a starter. It was juicy and had a slight sharpness of chilli which I really enjoyed.  For our mains, we shared butter chicken and malabar prawns.  We got the roti of the month to help soak up the curries.  As for drinks, I polished off two beers while my wife had a ginger beer.  While the curries were good, they were not amazing.
The total cost was a bit over £60.  I liked the meal, but it was too expensive for my liking.  It could be driven by the location of the restaurant in Marylebone and the expectation for dinner prices in the area.  I am used to spending less and feeling more satisfied (and full) after a night at an Indian restaurant.",-1
1,I came to this restaurant with my father and brother. We ordered the starters and main course together at 9:20pm and we received our starters with 20 mins. It took an hour for our main course to come. This is not right. I don't recommend this at all.,-1
4,"Loved this place! Very good Indian food! Would recommend if you're looking for authentic Indian food in a trendy area. However, the portions were quite small, so I was forced to order more food after the fact due to the smaller portions especially if you are sharing with others. Despite that good authentic Indian food!!!",1
5,"I really love this restaurant. Indian street food done really well. I think Roti Chai revolutionises Indian cuisine and is very much worth a visit. I also love the cocktails they have on offer. It was great to see their pop up at Pork Life a few weeks ago, too.",1
2,"I have to say that some of these reviews seem to be going very OTT. The food is OK - hardly 'transcendent' or 'sensational'. The space seems a little odd and not the kind of room i'd associate with India street food.
The thing I would associate Indian street food with is a very very low cost. Not the £10 that a small bowl of rice and 2 rotis cost here. I have no problem with paying a lot for good food, but those prices were getting dangerously close to extortion.
Then again, the place was packed so maybe i'm just too much of a Tayyabbs fanboy to appreciate food from  the sub-continent anywhere else!",-1
5,"Here is how good this place is - I ate there a year and a half ago and still think about how good it is. Very vegetarian friendly.  Everything I tried was delicious.  They brilliantly balance flavors and complexity.   I actually regret not going with more people just so I could try more things on the menu.  They are a little pricey - but then, so is London.",1
3,"Weekday lunch here.  Please excuse the fact that I cannot remember the correct names for many of the dishes we had.  We sat upstairs in the Street Food bit.
We shared starters. Chaat (puffed rice mixed with diced tomatoes, onions, coriander and a tamarind sauce), puri (crispy shells topped with diced potato, chickpeas, a tamarind sauce and yoghurt), the steamed chickpea cake, chicken lollipops and chicken strips with a spicy dipping sauce.  All of these were delicious although a couple of colleagues found the chickpea cake a little too 'out of the box' for their tastes.  I liked it.
We ordered curries for main.  I had the fish curry which was good if a little too salty.  Large chunks of deep-fried cod, cauliflower florets in a yellow mustard seed based sauce.  My colleagues tried the lamb curry with chapatis and said it was good.
GBP16 per person and loads of food.  Good value!  Stars docked for service which good rather shoddy once the place filled up.",-1
3,"Ok food. Flavored are generally one dimensional, though well executed. Had the lamb curry good lamb flavor. Dahl was not very flavorful. Paneer kind of tasted like stir-fry. Super spicy. Too bad they don't box up left overs. Big waste.",-1
5,Finally a trendy establishment that offers modern Indian food. I ate here recently for a group work function. Our party was quite impressed with the food & cocktails. This place is great for large parties they have plenty of seating and take reservations ahead of time. The menu has a bit of something for everyone to include vegetarian options.,1
5,"Super delicious and fresh. Sitting upstairs is more casual and noisy but downstairs is more reserved, with a more upscale menu. Definitely was a hit!",1
1,"I cannot speak for the food because I was kept waiting for a reservation I made. I arrived 15 minutes early and was told to wait 15 minutes. No problem. After waiting 30 minutes directly in front of the host, I felt that I had been mishandled badly enough. I told the same host that I wanted to cancel the reservation. He acted surprised and indicated that it was my fault that I did not just go downstairs at the time of the reservation. Flabbergasted!",-1
5,"Dined in the 'street kitchen""  upstairs on a quiet Sunday evening & just wow... Every dish was absolutely delicious & had superb flavours in everything we tried: the tarka dhal, railway lamb curry, chicken kola urandai & especially the fiery hakka chilli paneer which was my favourite. Their house masala chai was spicy, strong & fragrant, just how I like it. We passed on the desserts though were tempted by the keralan fruit salad & the chocolate cardamom tart.",1
5,Loved it. Sat  upstairs and was blown away.  If I were a restaurant investor I would invest in Roti Chai.  Wish we had one in NYC.,1
5,"Excellent for service and taste. The restaurant has two parts which are 'the street food' (upstairs) and 'fine dinning' (downstairs).  I tried a street food section and ordered a fish curry. It was very nice and spicy. The samosa has a vegetarian and meat version (2 pieces). I tried a vegetarian one and it's quite mild. 
I would recommend to try the street food first cos it's cheaper and got more varieties than the dinning one. I ended up paying less than 20 quids (included a service charge). It would be a very nice place for a group and family (It's less crowded during lunch)  But there's no reservation for the street food.",1
5,"So good.  Just so SO good. 
There were a number of menu items I hadn't seen before elsewhere, and, wanting to try something new, I asked the waiter for a recommendation.
I can't rave enough about the Hakka Chilli Paneer.  I'm usually not a fan of paneer, so it wasn't without trepidation that I acceded to the waiter's glowing recommendation.  I am so glad I did.  I am a fan of heat, and this didn't disappoint.  The flavor was so robust and so balanced.  I would come back just to have this dish.
The Chicken Manchurian was an inventive and delicious fusion of Chinese and Indian cuisine which I was happy to experience.  The service was great - present but not burdensome, and very cordial.  I will go back, probably any time I'm in London.",1
5,"One of my favourites and great food. Extremely popular place even though it is located out of the main traffic flow. I love the papri chat, chilli paneer, manchurian chicken and kabli chana.",1
2,"Really disappointed after reading all be great reviews on Yelp - first visit to London and have eaten at several excellent Indian places. This was not one of them.  We came at lunch time and even though the place was quite busy, we were seated almost immediately.   The first thing you notice is how LOUD it is.  Really, really, really loud.   We had to flag down a server to get helped.  Seating was quite tight.  Food came fairly quickly lollipop chicken (fried and overcomes), curry chicken (meh, it definitely needed more flavor) and spicy vegetable rice.  It was OK.   Agains, had to flag yet another server down to get our bill.  Overall, there I had hoped for much better - certainly a lot to choose from in London",-1
2,"Service was awful. Our server didn't come once to refill our waters and took forever to take our orders and give us the check. Both times, we had to have 2 people flag down servers multiple times before anyone came over. Manchurian chicken dish was gross and flavorless. Lamb curry was the best in terms of great lamb texture and curry flavor. The chilli paneer was definately a hit all around too.",-1
4,Excellent meal. Was downstairs at the 'formal sit down'  good service and decor. Staff was accommodating. Monkey 47 G&T is spectacular,1
5,"Best restaurant in this part of London. Seriously. Stick with upstairs (downstairs is a different menu and nothing exceptional). The upstairs menu is fantastic though! Small plates, so order a few dishes. Don't miss the chili paneer or the lychee teapot martini!",1
5,"Modern indian food like no other , try the bun chili chicken and the parsi chicken farcha",1
5,Amazing Indian food. A must try when in London. Great atmosphere. Very cool and modern.,1
5,"Gem of a restaurant that we found on our last night in London! We had food in their Street Kitchen. Their food tasted unbelievably delicious and the waitstaff were very polite. Because the portions were manageable, we were able to sample pretty much all the vegetarian appetizers and a few main course. If you're a vegetarian, I highly recommend their vegetable fried rice. A must have with the right balance of spices and vegetables! I'll definitely dine here the next time I'm in London.",1
5,I've only eaten in the downstairs area. The service has been good the couple times I've been there and the food outstanding. The Chili Paneer is really good and spicy. And chicken lollipops were crispy yet juicy and tender inside. I also tried lamb curry and it was good as well.  I'll definitely be back.,1
5,"The upstairs street menu is straightforward yet elegant, spicy yet sublime. Tried the new duck curry, it was fantastic. Chilled out with a ginger mojito. Will come again.",1
5,"We always eat here when we are in London. Excellent food. The staff is great but overworked. The hostess is superb. Try the dinner area downstairs, the cuisine is even better. Fantastic idli sambhar and Indo-Chinese dishes. Love the kulfi.",1
4,"Had lunch upstairs. Many unfamiliar dishes for me since I have never eaten Indian Street food before, but everything was very good. Will come back next time we are in London.",1
4,We started with the chickpea salad then a lamb biryani and both were delicious.,1
5,"Loved the place., Indian food that's really Indian. I tried the Methi malai paneer which was Yummmm..Yet to try the Indian street food which they serve on the 1st level. Do book your table for dinner tho'.",1
4,"Just ate today at roti chai for the first time. Big (BIG) recommendation. It's bally great. Attentive service, mega lamb curry and some strange delicious aperitif at the end (they said it was alcholic, just tasted like a capri-sun = YUM & DANGERMOUSE when during a working day).",1
5,"I live in New York and visited London over a long weekend. Just had to try the Indian food there and roti chai happened to be a somewhat random pick. Boy was I not disappointed. It is hands down the best Indian restaurant I have eaten at outside of India/Asia, and easily beats any Indian restaurant in New York. Good drinks, great atmosphere, and thoughtful menu.",1
5,"Been here a few times now. It's probably my favourite Indian restaurant, had been recommended to me by an Indian colleague as well. Great food, reasonable prices.",1
5,"Great Indian food at a great price. Great for trying some small plates and appetizers, along with outstanding main courses in modern atmosphere.",1
3,"The street kitchen upstairs was, Meh! Average food, average choice, nothing really stands out. Good for a bite if you are in the area not worth making a trek half-way across the town.",-1
3,"Went here on a Sunday for a late lunch and was seated immediately. Only the street kitchen was open which was fine by me, I was looking for a cheap meal anyways. I asked the waiter what are the favourites, he recommended the railway lamb curry and this chicken burger. Menu seemed much bigger than what was advertised online. The chicken burger was really good, interesting flavours and didn't really taste like anything I've had before. The railways lamb curry (which I've seen several people recommend) was not my favourite. By no means was it bad, it just wasn't that amazing in my opinion. Mind you, I was extremely hungover and Indian food may not have been the best call to help cure the hangover. Also a little dissapointed in the lack of naan but this might just be the street kitchen and the dining room does normally serve it. Service charge is included in the meal and I left there spending under 20$.",-1
4,"Just been to Roti Chai for the first time from a recommendation. 
It's almost as good as eating street food in Mumbai (just a lot more expensive - if compared). We sat upstairs in the street food area. The food was absolutely delicious. We chose almost all the veggie dishes on the menu. My favourites we the Hakka Chilli Paneer and the Tikki Burger . 
Love the flavours - will definitely be returning.",1
4,"Great location, great service, great food. Previous reviews really tell it all - well worth a visit.",1
2,"Disappointing!  I had higher expectations based on other reviews. We ate in the downstairs restaurant.  We sat near the kitchen and could see all of the food coming out.  Everything looked beautiful. We couldn't wait to get ours and dig in. I only wish it was as good as it looked. The butter chicken had a nice sauce, but the chicken itself wasn't.  It was too soft and had no flavor.  It tasted  boiled. Everything else we had was just OK.  The service was poor. During our trip we ate at two other Indian restaurants in London. Both were better, and less expensive.",-1
2,"I ate here on a Thursday night,fairly late, and the street level kitchen was quite busy.  The chicken leg appetizer was pretty good.  The samosa was fairly standard (a little too much of something in it, though).  The chicken curry was very good, whereas the lamb curry was marginal.  The banana chips were very good. 
The biggest problem was that the server brought the entire meal all at once (from the guava juice down to the curry), and by the time we finished appetizers the main was cold.  I asked why they did it, and the server said she did it because we didn't tell her not to.   Unusual, to say the least.",-1
5,"This place was recommended by a local and did not disappoint.  If you are looking for upscale Indian food the fine dining section is the place.  Every single dish was good, and the price was very reasonable.  Service was fast and attentive. Convenient to Oxford Street and some of the hotels near Marble Arch/Bond Street.",1
2,We went on boxing day as a party of 5 + 1 small kid. We decided to eat on the street food section at the top rather than dining in the basement. The street food was pretty average. Bhelpuri had too much tamarind and was sour. The Dhokla was not very fluffy. The manchurian was again a bit on the sour side and lacking sweetness. The lemon juice or nimbu pani tasted more of soda water and ice rather than any lemon flavour. Service was also slow despite it not being a busy night. The only good thing that I liked was the burger. Will not be trying the street food area again. The dining area for which i have reviewed before was a much better experience for me.,-1
5,Fantastic concept - Indian street food served at a restaurant in London! Not your traditional curry place but more like Indian meet Tapas,1
5,"Ah !! Another brilliant opening. 
I heard of Roti Chai from a column by Richard Vines on Bloomberg and I promptly visited at the next available opportunity. How could I not try out a street food joint as good as ""Dishoom"". 
Yes, it is generally as good. Although ""Dishoom"" serves many more dishes, its soul is Western Indian. Roti Chai on the other hand is pan-Indian. You can try the dhokla from the west and the fish curry from the east. The chaat from the north and the idli from the south. They have a much better variety to offer. 
The portion of the restaurant that's on the ground floor is meant primarily for snacks, though there are a few dishes that would work for a decent dinner as well. It's open all week and does not take reservations. The area in the basement has a more conventional dinner menu, but it's operational only from Tuesday to Saturday. One can reserve a table at this section of the restaurant. 
If you are visiting upstairs, I would strongly recommend the ""Hakka chilli paneer"". It's not for the faint hearted. It's very spicy and will test even the most hardened of green chilli enthusiasts (if there are any). The fish curry with mustard was gratifying. Its a tragedy that in a city with so many Bangladeshi immigrants, one cannot find decent Bengali food. This fish curry is a small step towards rectifying that. The dal, the chickpeas and the pulao are good too, but I didn't enjoy the samosa too much. The railway lamb curry is a must have. It's cooked using tender pieces of mutton along with potatoes. The fact that potatoes form an integral part of many curries in India is something that Indian restaurants in Britain have conveniently forgotten. This dish is a timely reminder. It comes with 2 soft, well made chapatis ... very authentic. 
The chicken chettinad that you can get downstairs is very tasty. I would also order the bread basket which gives you 3 different breads for the price of less than two. 
The service is excellent. Roti Chai is open till 9 PM on Sundays and the official ""last order"" is at 8:30 PM. I had reached at 8:45. In most places in London that would mean an automatic refusal to serve ... but not here. Strangely (for Europe), doing business and customer satisfaction is high on their list of priorities. 
Roti Chai is not very expensive. Most people can fill themselves for £25 or less. I have many many reasons to come back to this place (I had my first ""frooti"" in years here) and I shall also get all my friends.",1
4,"Fantastic restaurant just a block off of Oxford St. The butter chicken is a must order item but was a bit disappointed that we had to order naan as a separate menu item.  Nevertheless, we will be back again.",1
4,"Been there a few times now. I especially like the aloo tikki and the chciken 65. The veg rice pulao was also really good. I last went on a saturday night and while we had reservations, it was not a necessity.",1
1,"I am shocked by the 4.5/5 star rating this place has! Ate here last night with some friends before heading to a party in the area. After reading the glowing reviews on Yelp, the Street Kitchen seemed like a great choice.
Service: Front of the house seemed accommodating. The waitstaff, however, was either too persistent in their attempts to take our order or, when we needed them, not attentive enough. There also seemed to be a lack of coordination, as three different people tried to take our drink order. Despite this, we had to ask about four times for some water before any was brought to us (at least ten minutes wait time).
Food: From the Yelp reviews, I had high expectations. Sadly, no noteworthy dishes (aside from the chocolate cardamom tart) were to be had. I was also disappointed with the price. I don't mind paying for food, street food or otherwise, if the food justifies said price. But I honestly enjoyed the Indian pre-made meals I have purchased from Waitrose and Tesco more than the food here.",-1
2,Had great expectations when I walked past this establishment a few months before it opened. This place was heaving at lunchtime. Lunched with 2 friends in the Indian Street Kitchen  my overall experience was just lukewarm.,-1
4,I went here on a recent trip to London.  Absolutely love this place.  We got there a little early before they were open for dinner.  We sat at the bar and the bartender made me an awesome Strawberry Chai cocktail.  The food was excellent too.  Definitely one of the highlights of my trip.,1
1,"Yelp profile notwithstanding, a telephone call confirms that Roti Chai does not do take away. :(",-1
5,"My husband and I recently travelled to London for a short holiday. Just before our trip, we saw the Food Channel episode that featured Roti Chai. So we decided to stop in. My husband started chatting up the gentleman sitting next to us (to ask him what he ordered, as everything looked divine), and it turned out it was the owner! The owner was warm, gracious, and funny. He was eating there with an old friend; and they ended up speaking with us for the entire dinner and suggesting various food items. We ordered lamb kebab starters, paneer cheese in a green sauce, butter chicken, roti, garlic naan, a butternut squash starter, and more. Everything was outstanding! We also tried their signature cocktails (a cucumber vodka drink, and a chai spiced bellini). Both were so different from the norm, and were really nice twists to complement the food.
The owner very graciously sent over an after-dinner tea with vodka (which i never would have ordered, but was delicious!), as well as homemade pistachio popsicle sticks, which were full of flavor, but not so heavy.
We will definitely eat here when we return, and you should, too!",1
4,"Place is really nice, the location - nicer. I was served in good order and everything was great.",1
5,The closest to comfort food in London ! No place in New York City compares. Smallish menu but just getting it right every time makes it big enough for me. Love love love the place.,1
4,Great epicurian adventure for me! I loved the railway lamb curry and pulusu chiken. the host made a perfect recommendation to go to the street kitchen tables and our waitress took the time to explainn and recommend the meals.,1
3,"The place wows you the moment you walk into the door. It has a unique Indian look and feel. There are kurkure( strictly Indian commercially available to most of the parts) and Parle-G biscuits( the oldest biscuit in the Indian biscuit history for me) stacked nicely next to the entrance. That's when I fell in love with it's ambience. We sat on the street room. The truck sign on the walls are just one of a kind. We were nicely welcomed and seated quickly in about 15 mins, as promised. We sat next to the kitchen, it smelt heavenly. We ordered about 4 dishes which included 2 appetizers, but they weren't enough. So we ordered one more. We tried papri-chat, it was nice and fresh. The next we had was Parsi chicken which was nothing but ordinary. We ordered two other chicken dishes i.e chicken manchurian and andhra curry chicken, both were very bland and dull. So, I would give it no more than 3 stars",-1
4,"Great food, everything was delicious.  Highly recommend the lamb and fish curries.",1
3,If I could I would give 3.5 for Roti Chai. Serivce and setting are lovely - we sat upsatirs in the casual area. Most of the food is good - love the aloo tikki burger and the paneer. Aloo Gobi curry is delicious ajnjd traditional but the Daal however was tasteless and watery. The need some roomali roti like Dishoom. The bread basket was a bit dry and to oheavy for the rich curries.,-1
4,"The meal, ambiance and service are great. I ordered delicious chicken masala, didn t make it to finish the whole portion. The waiter told me he will not charge me the whole meal, because I didn t finished it.",1
4,"This restaurant was a very pleasant surprise. I'd give it five stars if not for the somewhat spotty service. Our waiter could hardly give us the time of day, much less manage an attempt at pleasantry. The owner or manager stepped in frequently to fill the gaps. The food was excellent, I recommend the Hakka chilli paneer, we had 2 orders of it.",1
4,"Lovely location, its a hidden gem and a lot better than the more commercial eateries like Dishoom and Masala Zone which I find have not got that real indian feel about it.. its very much catered to the modern western stereotype of a fancy indian.",1
3,"Need to keep it short and sweet for this place ! The food here is very interesting and delicious. We ate in the dining room and ordered a couple of dishes such as palak paneer, naan, tarka dal, chilli paneer and an eggplant main whose name I cannot remember. The food was quite good ...not your typical Indian fare with layers of oil. Now the bad part - The service was shoddy ...we waited and waited for our starters and mains. The server was polite but seems like it is not managed very well. A big '0' for the value for money part :( :( The portions were shockingly small ! Now I am not a big eater ...but if I don't feel at least half full ..it is a sign that the quantity sucked. Not sure if the portions are this tiny because they are bending over backwards to remain on Oxford St ! Please avoid this place if you want a bang for your buck. An average meal for two will burn a hole in your pocket and leave you hungry for more (literally!). Such a disappointing meal :( and such a high cost 50 GBP for it !",-1
5,Nothing short of amazing ate here twice while I was in London nobu never lets me down!!!,1
3,"Our Monday night experience at Nobu was MEH and only made it to A-OK thanks to attentive staff and management. The food alone would NOT have made it to A-OK. 
Going to Nobu for her birthday after the completion of The Championship (aka Wimbledon for folks that are not interested in tennis) is our friend's tradition. So we looked forward some treats. All three of us love sashimi, but for variety, we thought the seasonal tasting menu would be a good idea. Wrong! The tasting menu was MEH at best. I rarely had worse. And it is hard to get less value (£100 per person). The tapas size dishes were generally over-sauced. On the seafood starter plate had salmon, but - in my opinion - salmon doesn't belong on a sushi/sashimi plate (unless you are feeding kids that are afraid of raw seafood). The marinated hamachi was one of the few enjoyable bites. It would have been better without the marinade as I like to taste the ingredients. Do not get me wrong. We all love spice and spicy dishes. I mean extreme spicy as long as the spice doesn't cover the ingredients' taste. Here Nobu generally failed. It got worse with their Wagyu course. No idea where that old cow came from. There was no sign of tender fattiness that Wagyu is famous for. Just pieces that remind one of shoe leather: both in texture and taste (and I am only exaggerating slightly). It was time for a call to management. They actually brought us a replacement dish. A Peruvian  style beef dish that was simmered rather than fried. It wasn't a great dish either, but the cooking method seemed to be more compatible with the beef they offered. The spice - a sauce that tasted a lot like tabasco from a bottle - didn't really agree with beef. The manager said that it is a traditional Peruvian spice. If true, I conclude that I do not like Peruvian spice. 
Frustrated with the food so far, we ordered a few pieces of sashimi and finally Nobu didn't mess up. Mackerel and o-toro were excellent. The scallops might be good for the location, but living in New England spoiled us, and therefore cannot win awards. The razor clams were out. Otherwise, the fish choices seemed pedestrian. Mackerel and o-toro are the winners. 
On the beverage side, I asked about their Daiginjo. Our waitress said that the Daiginjo is very bland and she recommended one of their other dry sakes, Onigoroshi (at half-price). As I was hesitating, she offered to bring us two cups to try. The recommended sake was not bad, but had too many strong flavors with a hint of a bitter, chemical aftertaste. We stuck to the Daiginjo and were very happy after three large carafes for three people. The standard Nobu Daiginjo has a typical, clean, delicate Niigata flavor. Definitely done right! May be too delicate vor the Peruvian side of the restaurant. 
Eventually we made it to dessert, which was pleasant and covered some of the earlier pains. Picture to follow ...",-1
5,"Went for my birthday dinner and loved everything. 
We had the ""classic"" omakase, which consisted of a good balance across starters, cold dishes, hot dishes and a dessert. Everything was fresh and flavourful, particularly the signature miso cod. 
Ambience was nice and modern, though it did get quite noisy toward later in the evening. I wish it had a bit more of an exclusive and quiet feel to it but otherwise, enjoyed the simple yet posh environment. 
Service was spot on. Our waiter was proactive in explaining the menu and prompt throughout the evening in bringing out drinks and dishes. 
Would most love to return",1
1,"There once was a place called Nobu.
It was so new it no one knew.
That one day to the next
It would change from the best
To a place filled with rules
So sad that the fun
Left forever
That is the modern Nobu. 
A shadow of its former self.
With twice the assholery.",-1
3,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon just as it opened, and there were plenty of tables available. I had the set lunch menu with 2 apps, 1 main, 1 dessert. For my 2 apps, I got the sashimi selection and tuna tataki; I got the teriyaki for my main, and there was only 1 option for dessert. 
Everything was fine and the service was not bad. It's not worth the price, but then again you don't come here expecting to eat the amount you pay for. I was worried the hosts would be very snobby but that wasn't the case. I'm giving it 3 stars because really the food and service don't stand out; I'm glad I was able to try the infamous Nobu but I probably won't come here again until I start earning my meager accounting salary.",-1
5,"Believe the Hype....Exceptional service, exceptional food, LOVED NOBU, cant wait to try another NOBU next time I travel.",1
4,"Good and solid japanese food.  Consistent with their other locations around the world. I feel if you you been to one, you been to them all. My advice: Try a Nobu that's not in the city you reside in, just for the experience.
We ordered all the usual stuff:
beef tataki
sashimi(uni/toro/hamachi/scallop/abalone/cuttlefish/wagyu/ etc)- very fresh
sashimi salad
rolls - avocado roll and tuna roll (the kids loved them)
salmon avocado hand roll - substantial and bigger than expected
black cod - cooked perfectly
wagyu w/truffle 
Worth it, however there's other places also worth trying.
Lunch menu is good, too.",1
4,"Great food - consistent with Nobu anywhere in the world. Good service. Good bar selection. Although it would be nice if the bar had high stools, or bistro style tables with high stools. While you're waiting on your table or for the rest of your party, you're practically sitting on the floor on the very low stools, which I didn't love as a tall person.
Also, the signage to the restrooms are slightly lacking. And if you use them on the way out, expect to get lost when you exit on the floor below and have no idea where you are relative to where you entered, unless you're a regular.
Aside from some tuning on the venue, the sushi is good, fresh, tasty, and well plated. It's Nobu - you can't leave feeling too disappointed.",1
5,"We decided to try walking in for a Saturday night and was fortunate to get a table (2 of us).
Definitely was skeptical due to the loud music and fancy decors, would the food let us down? 
Fortunately the legendary Nobu lived up to the hype. The scallops were fantastic and some of the best we've ever had. Fresh, sweet and all the flavours on the plate complimented each other. Specifically the kelp was a textural and flavourful delight. 
All the sushi we ordered was fresh and very well prepared. Even the pork belly was delicious, with great texture on the skin and flavours coming through the preparation.
The pricing was reflective of the Mayfair location and Nobu fame. Well worth it however for a special time or you wanted to treat yourself.",1
2,"It isn't really Japanese. Everyone from the wait staff are Eastern European. I doubt they speak Japanese. I could barely understand their English. The food isn't really Japanese, except they use soy-sauce.  Okay food richly decorated.
The salmon tar tar is just soak in plain soy-sauce. Yuck!
It is loud. One cannot carry on a conversation. Every time a customer walks in all the wait staff will yell out something that could almost be confused with a Japanese greeting (いらっしゃいませ). At least they did it with convictions.
I would skip this one if you are look for food instead of an event.",-1
3,"The sushi/sashimi at Nobu's is not the freshest and would make the best sushi chefs cry. But, overall, the chain produces a consistently pleasant dining experience, with some signature dishes that people happily go back for: kelp salad, artichoke salad, rock shrimp tempura, miso black cod, chocolate bento, etc.",-1
3,"The decor is tacky. Food is good, but I doubt it's worth the price tag. A bit of a disappointment. But it's ok, it was a business lunch and I didn't pay for it personally.",-1
5,Great service. Just what you would expect from Nobu. The tiger prawn tempura is my favourite. Top quality food. We were well looked after. Subtle yet great atmosphere.,1
5,"I've LOVED Nobu!! I was taken there for my birthday treat and it really was a treat!! 
We arrived on a Tuesday lunchtime so it was fairly quiet and were seated immediately. Prior to entering the restaurant, you can give your coats and bags to the cloakroom and then go up the stairs to the main restaurant. 
When we sat down we were given a choice of still or sparkling water (however I would've just gone with tap but I felt too shy to say at the time) and given a drinks and food menu. 
To drink, I ordered a summer breeze cocktail (vodka, prosecco, raspberries and soda) which was really light and refreshing whilst my boyfriend ordered a virgin Mojito. The cocktails came fairly quickly and were really good! 
When ordering we had a few bits that had caught our eye, however I asked the waitress her opinion. She was very knowledgeable and when she saw that we were ordering two dishes which had various tempura bits in, she said that she would arrange for them to arrive at separate times which was nice of her. 
We ordered the Chicken with Teriyaki Sauce and Tempura which came with salad, rice and miso soup and that was delicious!! The chicken was extremely tender and the sauce was sweet and not too sticky or dry. 
We also had the octopus jalapeño which was slices of cold octopus in a jalapeño sauce. I thought that it was different but I liked it. Very tasty. 
Next there was Lobster Tempura with a Creamy Wasabi sauce and that was absolutely divine! The creamy wasabi sauce complimented the lobster and wasn't over powering. Definitely my favourite dish so far. 
We couldn't go to Nobu without having sushi so we ordered the California with Crab & Avocado Inside Out cut roll and it was really tasty. I've never had crab sushi before but it was great. 
For pudding we shared a Chocolate Bento Box which had a flourless chocolate fondant with almond ice cream. The menu stipulated green tea ice cream but I asked if we could change it and the waitress was happy to oblige. It was delicious but very rich. In hindsight I should have ordered something fruitier! 
Overall Nobu was great. Definitely go there for a special occasion/treat as it is expensive however it's worth it for the food, drink and overall experience you get!",1
3,"Underwhelming meal. Four of us ordered both versions of the Omikase dinner. When a sizable piece of plastic wrap was found in one of the sushi rolls, the staff didn't really seem to think much of it. The roll was replaced with a fresh one but the manager never made an appearance to apologize. Presentation nice, service slightly above average but not special. We were hoping for a memorable dinner in London, but left with a pricey souvenir.",-1
3,"Pricey, food is good but not sure it's worth the tag. Anyway, great for people watching. Ambience is loud too but drinks list is long to make up for it.",-1
2,"For such a posh neighbourhood a very mediocre dining experience.
I'd been wanting to go to Nobu London for a while as I had tried it in other cities like Miami and found it to be a fashionable and trendy dining experience. Not so in London's Nobu. As a matter of fact it was disappointing from soup to nuts, from hello to goodbye.
We arrived, having a confirmed reservation, and well, I found the host a bit off putting and snooty, like he was quite bothered by having to work at all. That was the welcome but I was determined to put that behind us and enjoy the food. The dining room was very noisy and to be honest I can't say too much for the very plain decor which for having the upscale market clientele did not fit. The service too was very sub par. Our waitress really didn't know the menu and when asked questions had to go ask someone else and come back to relay the information, it all just felt 2nd rate. 
The food too was just OK. Some of our sushi rolls were very basic and uninteresting. Perhaps had we had a waitress who could have made suggestions it might have helped with our selections. We did know our sushi but it might have helped to have tried more of the house specials, that sort of thing. It was all just bland and unexciting. Not to mention the noise in the dining room made it very hard to converse at the table. I was quite ready to leave which is a shame because we were very much looking forward to dining there. 
To end the whole night out, a quick stop at the toilets resulted in a trek down a back staircase that felt like I was in the back of a nightclub. And the toilets themselves looked like they were from a nightclub. It really highlighted the fact that Nobu is way past its prime. We left looking for someplace else to have dessert.",-1
2,"It feels like there's an extensive menu. We tried a little bit of everything, and yet 90% of it was rather unappetizing. What we ordered: 
- Baby spinach salad with shrimp: 5/5 actually one of the only good things that we ordered that night
- Chicken with teriyaki: 3/5 chewy and overly sweet (even for teriyaki!)
- Miso cod: 0/5 Oh. My. God. This was inedible. This was supposed to be the star of the show and it was a huge let down. It felt like it was doused in maple syrup. Couldn't taste the fish. Much too sweet and hard to stomach
- Toro sashimi: 3/5 the tuna didn't taste like very fresh/high quality fish
- Tuna avocado roll: 4/5 eh, very plain but that's just your run of the mill tuna avo roll
- Edamame: 5/5 hard to mess up
- Sea urchin crispy nori sushi cup: 2/5 I'm usually a big fan of sea urchin but the crispy nori sushi cup felt like burnt/tasteless/cardboard seaweed and it didn't complement the flavour of the sea urchin at all!
- Chocolate bento box: 4/5 pretty standard chocolate fondant and the green tea ice cream was also ok
The service was really good, our waitress was very attentive, but I would personally never come back here again, especially considering the price for what you get.",-1
5,"My son took me to Nobu on my birthday and it was amazing, chic and glamorous.
Beef tataki and sashimi were were delicious.
My only observation is that since it was my birthday I believe they can do better than green tea ice cream and a candle.
Liked it better than Nobu Miami and NY.",1
5,"Wow wow wow! One of London's best restaurants!!!
Amazing quality food, atmosphere and service.",1
4,"Excellent food, as you'd come to expect from any Nobu establishment. All the usual favorites are here, including new-style sashimi, crispy rice with sushi, miso black cod, and creamy spicy shrimp. Although not very authentic, all our dishes were fresh and delicious, and presented excellently as well. 
Service is decently friendly, if a bit unorganized at times (probably due to the fact that you don't have a dedicated server) - we asked to keep a menu for perusing main courses after ordering some appetizers, only to have it whisked away by a passing waiter. Waters were refilled frequently, and new cups of green teas were brought out as soon as the previous ones were finished. 
Decor leans towards the modern; lots of wood and decent lighting. I do wish they would eliminate the irasshaimase that all the staff shout out at arriving guests - it gets annoying pretty quick, and they all botch the pronunciation anyways.",1
5,"I booked this for my partners birthday celebrations.  I was initially surprised at the ease of booking a slot and the restaurant was very accommodating.  We had been meaning to try this Nobu but had not got round to it.  On arrival we were greeted by a cloakroom attendant who checked in our belongings then we moved onto the restaurant.  The staff were always polite, courteous and very helpful.  I felt for the reputation of the restaurant and location the interior decor felt a bit basic however I tried not to be off put by this.
Once seated we asked the waitress to suggest a selection of dishes whilst also highlighting certain ones we wanted to try.  Her opinions were very helpful and honest and I would say her choices helped make our meal very enjoyable.  We ordered octopus jalapeño, lobster tempura, chicken teriyaki, Californian crab sushi rolls and cocktails.  
The waitress assessed our order and suggested the order with in which for our food to arrive at our table to maximise the dining experience, which it did.
The octopus was very nice however the pieces could of been slightly bigger.  The chicken teriyaki was very good as was the sushi.  However the absolute favourite was the lobster tempura.  It was amazing, although pricey it is well worth the cost and I would of been happy just having that, a man with simple yet expensive taste!
Once we had tackled the main and starters we shared a dessert bento box, again with staff accommodating the changes we requested, which in this case was a change of ice cream flavour.  
Overall the dining experience was amazing, well worth it but I would suggest for a special occasion as it is very pricey.  The food is splendid, the staff superb and I would say it is one of my favourite meals I have had.  What are you waiting for, go to Nobu!",1
2,"Poor service, we had to keep asking for water, waited 30 mins for a single dessert while other guests ate. Flavours were very good, presentation also, but it's overpriced. Cocktails were fantastic. Overall disappointed - I won't be coming back.",-1
3,"Before reviewing Nobu, I should note that I have been to Japan and eaten fresh sushi there.
That being said, Nobu is likely the best sushi you can have in London. Our party arrived on time and we were promptly seated. The staff checked our coats and took us to our table. The locale is very trendy with some great lighting centered just above the table. Great for taking photos of your food! Also people watching as you'll see all walks of life inside.
I expected the sushi to be the highlight of my dining experience here but instead it was the appetizers, notably the sushi tacos, the baby tiger shrimp tempura, and best of all--the roasted padron peppers. Each order of sushi tacos brings just one delightful little boat with some salted sushi and tasty salsa sauce to go with it. The taco was great with a nice buttery flavor. The baby tiger shrimp tempura stole the show. They were just perfectly fried with a non-excessive helping of creamy spicy sauce. And you'll think I'm crazy for saying this but the shrimp was laid out on the freshest bed of arugula (or rocket, for the Brits) that I've ever had. So fresh that my friend and I finished up all the tasty greens after we finished the shrimp.
I was surprised to see the padron peppers on the menu instead of shiso (I suspect they may be the same). These playful peppers are known for their random distribution of spicy. Most of the peppers are not, but occasionally you'll get a really hot one and you won't figure out until you take a bite. These were roasted to perfection and quickly devoured by the members of our party. If these are on the menu (I believe they were a special that night) I suggest you try them. Their taste is pepper-y but distinctly different. More savory than sweet and rarely found in restaurants.
The drinks menu is nice an extensive with some traditional offerings plus a lot of nice Japan-inspired drinks involving sake, plum wine, lychee liquor, and shiso pepper leaves. I was between a bourbon based drink and the japanese margarita and ultimately went for the latter  which contained red chili infused sake in addition to your margarita fixings. There's a great number of non-alcoholic juice-based options if that is more your style. The lychee beverage was just sweet enough and definitely a nice alternative for those nights you really don't want to spike that alcohol level.
Finally, the sushi. The sushi tacos had some of that lovely raw fish served at Nobu but were overpowered by the salsa and taco. The real show is with the sashimi. You order your individual piece and they'll bring them out in a grand serving plate. You get your choice of different tunas--all of which are fantastic and fresh. I had a lovely dining experience with the exception of a couple sashimis whose rice beds fell apart. These were dabbed on the underside with just the right amount of wasabi. Although if you like some more you'll have some of that as well at your table.
Ultimately this was a positive experience albeit over priced. This is likely a combination of Nobu being a trendy London restaurant and the steep prices for decent fresh fish in an inland city. As mentioned before, the show stealers were really the tempura shrimp and the padron peppers rather than the raw fish.  At the end of the day, the reality is that I had a more satisfying sushi experience at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Tokyo than I did at the great Nobu in London. I loved the arugula and padron peppers, but is that really what you should take away from this experience? Just not worth the price tag.",-1
5,"Miso black cod. Enough said.
Every dish is perfect - lobster with truffle, amazing sashimi - and the service very efficient.",1
4,"I've always wanted to come to Nobu in London so when I made reservations, I was looking forward to the experience already. The waiters are very accommodating towards my vegan needs and made sure everything I ordered didn't have fish sauce/butter etc. My avocado tartar was delightful and I have no idea what made their veggie stir fry so delicious. We ordered lovely cocktails too and the entire experience was very lovely. I like how it's an upscale restaurant but you could definitely dress up or down here. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for some fancy, Japanese cuisine in London.",1
4,"The first Nobu restaurant in London. Fairly typical Nobu style. Craving for Sushi or Omakase, the place to go! Good selection of sake, professional service, and a relaxing atmosphere! Love it!",1
3,"Nobu has always been on my to try list. However, as London has so many restaurants, I finally got around to it on an opentable deal (4 courses for 49 pounds). I was excited to finally go. Then I went to the wrong Nobu. I went to the flagship store on Berkley Street only to realized that my deal was at a different location on Park Lane. When I finally arrived at the restaurant, I was disappointed, as it looked quite plain and we even only had those one time use chopsticks. 
I ignored it all, as I was anticipating a great meal. Then it turned out to be a very OK experience. The four course we had were sashimi starter, assortment of sushi, tempura and then chicken with Teriyaki Sauce. I was expecting a lot more from Nobu, or at least a little twist or something different. If these were the dishes I want to eat, I would have gone to a local Japanese restaurant. I felt it was totally pedestrian. I understand that usually restaurants don't tend to put their best dishes in set menu deals, but come one, maybe just one awesome dish to make me want to come back and try the regular menu. Now, I have totally no desire of returning.",-1
4,"Food: We ordered the shrimp tempura for our starter (always a great way to start the dinner), the red chilli sole (delicious!) and the poussin truffle (great flavour) for our mains and added in a spicy tuna roll.
Drinks: We ordered two glasses of prosecco.
Price: 131.10 GBP for two people.  It's expensive, but it's Nobu.
Ambiance: For a Monday night it was buzzing.  There were a lot of business dinners, but also a lot of locals enjoying a night out.
Service: Our server was very friendly.  They did mess up on the timing of our entrees because my sole came out first and the chicken arrived 20 minutes later.    They apologised for the delay, but said ""the chicken comes from another kitchen""...not sure if I believe them.
Would I go back?  Yes.  Nobu is a classic and it's much better here in London than in NYC.",1
3,You've been to one nobu and you have been to them all. It's a bit overpriced and over rates at this point.,-1
5,Was at Nobu on 6/2/16. First time. Everything was as expected. Called at the last minute for reservation and they were able to get us in within an hour. Waiter was excellent taking his time to explain and to make sure we did not over order to much food. He actually had us cancel some food we ordered because we were going overboard on the ordering. Sushi was fresh and well presented. Wife had Teriyaki Chicken and it was cooked well. Tempura Shrimp appetizer was just right and dipping sauces were tasty.,1
5,"Great place for sushi and drinks!! Let's start off with the drinks...my top 3 are the Watermelon Martini, Lychee Martini, and the Pear and Cinnamon Mojito. I'm all about tasty drinks.
The food is sooo tasty! Nobu and Zuma are a must every time I visit London. Must haves are the Rock Shrimp, Spicy Tuna with Crispy Rice, Hamachi (Yellowtail) with Jalapeño Sashimi, and Miso Cod.
Overall the staff is nice but they get somewhat unorganized when it gets busy. I'm a big fan :)",1
3,"This is one of those, I must try in my lifetime places based on reputation certainly.  One of the only chances I could get was when I got the bento box on a special opentable deal with friends who had organised it recently.
Pros:
Tuna Sashimi - Wonderful
Assorted sushi was very fresh and tasty (3 nigiri and 3 maki rolls).
Black Cod was good.
Cons:
Raspberry cocktail came with deal and it was OK. Nothing special.
Not the biggest bento box in size.
Didn't think much of the décor and surrounding space at all. Very simple which is fair enough since Japanese style is like that, but it was almost too simple (especially if you were to pay a proper premium price to visit). And seemed to be a lot of staff hanging around. Not bad, but nothing special.",-1
3,"of course the food is great - however, I have had food just as great for a third of the price. I was really looking forward to my meal and had high expectations. and although I enjoyed my meal - I couldnt help thinking of all of the things I could have spent that money on and still had a great meal - the decor is nothing special and the wait staff quite rushed. 
In summary: Great food, over priced in mediocre surroundings.",-1
2,"I agree totally with Kirsten C ! Spot on. Went there tonight and was very disappointed. Main course arrived late and cold. Didn't even get a proper apology from the waiter forget about anything to make it up. Bad service! Never again! You can really eat good sushi with that money!!!!!! So yes, food didn't throw me on my back at all. 
Sorry but no, thank you Nobu :-/",-1
4,Really enjoyed their food. They add clever twists to the dishes - would definitely recommend,1
4,"Well...It's Nobu & what that means is pricey. With that out of the way...
Food: Fantastic. Quality of sushi was excellent
Service was close to perfection.",1
1,"""Good evening and welcome to Nobu London..."" Yeah, right! I didn't feel welcome at all.
At Nobu London you can reserve a table, but for a maximum of two hours. This is the new generation of fast food. Literally.
""Would you like some *something unintelligible*?"" Some what? ""Oh, you haven't been here before. Eh, what do you usually like to eat?"" My sister says that she likes spring rolls and tempura maki. ""Nice, something more?"" We actually have to ask if it's possible to wait for the last one (me, I came a few minutes late) before ordering, and maybe have a look at the menu.
When I arrive they start filling up our glasses with water. That we pay for. You take one sip and they're all over you filling up your glass again. And again. And again. ""Do you want another one?""
So, food then. We decide to order a wide range of sushi, meat, green beans and spring rolls to share. After giving our order she suggests ordering a main meal for each of us as well, because it won't be enough. We have to convince her that we'll start with this, and then see.
Ordering a couple of beers and a coke as well. Beer is thrown into the glass with no control, I've rarely seen that much foam. And they continue filling up all the time. Just to get rid of it. So we can order some more.
And now the food starts arriving. First some sushi. At least the food isn't the worst I've ever tasted. That's something. Moving the last piece of sushi from the plate, and they're all over us again removing the plate. It happens again, and again. They even ask if they could take out those we haven't finished yet.
We're kinda wondering if this is a comedy show with hidden cameras. At least not a restaurant where you have to pay £3.50 for rice in an espresso cup, and where a dinner for three adults and a child, without starters or dessert, costs £160. Remember that we ordered little food. Yet we were all satisfied. We would like to have some dessert, though. But not here.
Paying was an exciting process. Just by putting the credit card at the table we got the bill, and seconds later the payment machine. ""Insert your card here, please"". We had to persuade her to let us look at the bill first. No option whether you wanted to pay the service charge or not, even though the bill stated this opportunity.
Before leaving for dessert at Hard Rock Café I had to go to the toilet. Straight forward, to the right, in through some doors who made me wonder if I was heading toward a submarine or space ship. Then down some stairs and through a couple of corridors. Oh, there it is! If you're a man at least, women has a few more stairs to take.
After doing what I had to, I went to wash my hands (of course). Oh, another Nobu-employee. Thanks for showing me how to turn on the water, I wouldn't find out myself. Yeah, I know how soap dispensers works as well, thanks dude. And even before I got the soap off my hands he stood there with the towel up in my face. If I want another one? Does it look like I would need another one. Don't think so. And then you want money? Here is a pound, hope you're happy!
So... finding my way back is the next mission. I wasn't aware that I came here for a labyrinth adventure, but that's how it turned out. After taking some stairs, I try a door. Oh, hi dude. ""This is wrong way"" We take one more stair before trying again. Old flowers, meeting rooms and an elevator. Guess it's wrong again. After walking up and down the stairs trying some doors we found our way out of the labyrinth.
Finally out of this place we're heading down the street for a dessert at Hard Rock Café. At least we're welcome and we can even sit as long as we want.
Spare your time, money and irritation. You're not welcome at Nobu anyway.",-1
5,"Delicious Sushi, Great Service, and Lovely Sake.
We were lucky enough to get a seat at the Sushi bar on a Friday night.",1
3,"Ah, Nobu. I'd been looking forward to going to visiting you for so long.  Honestly, if I had gone here a few years ago when good food in London was hard to fine, I would have left this dinner with a full stomach and huge smile on my face despite the bill. My 3 star rating here isn't' because the food is bad - because let's be honest, great sushi isn't easy to find in London, but because the value just simple isn't there.  I wish I could say I wasn't disappointed but we left Nobu full on tempura, delicious sushi, dessert, cocktails, saki and a 200 quid bill and I couldn't help thinking of all the other places we could have gone and left just as satisfied for half the price.  
We decided to go to Old Park Lane as it was easier to get a last minute reservation (so no, not Berkley Square!).  Though Nobu is indeed right next to the Park, the view isn't what you would want or expect given the status of the restaurant and I was disappointed during a visit to the ladies' room to see how old and not-charming the walk down the stars was. These may seem like petty things to point out, but when you're paying top notch for dinner (and with comparable places now in London) this just didn't do it for me.
Sorry, Nobu. Maybe I'll like you better in NYC.",-1
3,"What can I say about Nobu. First of all, the name carries a lot of weight and you expect nothing but the best when you make the decision to eat at Nobu. They have an international reputation the maintain. 
I met a friend of mine here for cocktails and dinner on a Friday evening and was not at all surprised to find it very busy. I was on an unexpected visit to England having just returned from Borneo and was very happy that nobu could take a reservation on such short notice. 
The service was pretty good, not great but it was very busy. The food was as well good but not fantastic. I have had better sushi at a ""hole-in-the-wall"" in Hawaii and for fraction of the price. The drink menu was on point and their cocktails were quite good.
All in all not the best Nobu I've been to and not the best sushi I've ever had but it was pretty much what I expected from Nobu London. I wouldn't make this my first stop next time I'm in London. I'm not saying don't come - just look to other options before you decide.",-1
5,"Great sushi in London.
If you walk in as a solo diner, you can sit at the sushi bar without a reservation.  The service is fast, the fish is incredibly high quality, and the sushi is made with love.
If you order a couple rolls, you'll fill up on rice a bit and not break your wallet. 
I've eaten here many times, it's always consistent and good.  Service is great",1
4,"An overall solid performance, with just 2 complaints to make.
For lunch with I had a single piece of o-toro tuna sushi, the new style salmon sashimi, and a beef katsu donburi. For all this and a glass of iced green tea I payed 60 pounds.
The o-toro sushi was fantastic. The quality of the fish was exquisite, and the rice was just perfect, bringing such an amazing amount of flavour which, instead of masking the flavour of the tuna, enhanced it. There was no need to add any wasabi in my opinion as the right amount was already added by the chef. Even the ginger and fresh wasabi which accompanied the sushi was of very high quality. 10/10
Nobu's new style sashimi is, simply put, Japanese style carpaccio. The sashimi is arranged on a plate with shaved ginger, sesame seeds, and finely chopped scallions. It's then drizzled with soy sauce, and I believe sesame oil and some yuzu or lemon juice, which gives it a sour/tart flavour. Heated olive oil is also drizzled over the sashimi to cook it slightly, altering it's texture and flavour slightly. I thought this dish was great, except the dish was a bit too sour, overpowering the other flavours and unbalancing the dish, making it hard to discern the taste of the fish, or even the other components of the dish. A little less acidity would go a long way. 7/10
The main course course was the beef katsu donburi, which is a thin breaded beef steak about an inch thick, fried first in oil, the finished in a separate pan with a broth mixture where a beaten egg mixture is added towards the end of cooking such that it almost wraps around the beef. It's served over a bed of rice. It was delicious. The beef and the egg mixture had taken on the taste of the savoury, slightly sweet flavour of the broth, complementing it beautifully with it's own. The rice was also perfectly cooked and was lightly coated in the thick broth as well. Unfortunately the beef was overcooked to 'well done', which was a shame as it dried out the beef. It was explained to me before that they're unable to cook it medium-rare as it's quite thin, however I was expecting it medium or medium-well at most, rather than the well-done and dry state that it came. Although the flavours were fantastic and the rest of the dish was damn near perfect, the main component of the dish being dry and overcooked greatly detracted from the dish. 7/10.
Although the raw ingredients used here, especially in the sushi/sashimi dishes, are of an extremely high quality, the execution of the dishes was a let down. New style sashimi is an interesting idea, but the dish was too tart to be something truly memorable, and the overcooking of the beef in an otherwise wonderful donburi is almost criminal. A good meal, but not great, which is what Nobu should be.",1
2,"Disappointing.
Went here for a work dinner, so while I did not have to pay, I will still disappointed.  
I'm always cautious of Japanese restaurants where there are no Japanese patrons. I was here for dinner on a Monday night and did not see a salary-man in sight.
Do not get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the food. There was nothing great about the food either.  When you're hawking a 100 pound omakase, I expect to be impressed. I think Nobu was one of the trendsetters for what we now see as the typical western Japanese restaurant. That's exactly how it felt. Like every Japanese restaurant from the 90's.  
I love gindara miso to death, but the Nobu version was not any better than the 100 imitation restaurants. I would not return unless I absolutely had to. There are other better overpriced Japanese restaurants.",-1
1,"What is the fuss all about?
I am now wishing I had read Yelp reviews BEFORE we went.  
Picked this place to celebrate a friend visiting London, for a big milestone birthday dinner.  What a terrible choice.
Being from Vancouver and then Toronto, I was spoiled for choice for good sushi.  Ever since moving to Europe, I've had a tough time finding something as delicious as my favourite haunts in Toronto.  
So naturally, I thought Nobu, world famous, name-dropped on shows, etc.etc., must have decent sushi.  I had high expectations.
The food was...meh.
Small portions, expensive, and not that impressive.  If you're from Vancouver or Toronto, seriously, that place down the street from you that you think has average food but is cheap does the same thing.
Ugh.  To add to it, the service was downright awful.  A couple of us had set dinners and a few of us shared small plates.  Only those of us who declared ""sharing"" were allowed plates.  Other people asked, and were TURNED DOWN.  I'm not even kidding you here - ""oh no sir, you don't need a plate.""  
As soon as the sharers finished, their plates and chopsticks were whisked away.  We protested ""but we want to keep our chopsticks so we can try a piece of other people's food!""  The server looked at us like we spoke Martian to her.
We were a party of 5 - four of us had received what we ordered, finished it all, before the fifth person received his first dish.  And he ordered three small dishes.  Yes, food comes staggered in a Japanese restaurant, but this was absolutely ridiculous.  You couldn't get out a sushi roll for this guy in 30 minutes, but everyone else at the table who ordered sushi got theirs in a timely manner?
Just...DON'T DO IT.
I'm so upset that my friend's birthday celebration was marred by such a terrible dining experience.  Wish I had kept the other reservation I made for that evening instead.",-1
4,"A great established name that still seems to offer a near perfect experience. Service and food that can't be faulted within a simple Japanese decor setting that actually makes you feel very comfortable. The above comes at a ""price"" and the cocktail list could also do with some work. Tip - Go for a bento box to try a wide selection of dishes, this also include their blackened cod with miso signature dish which is a must. (Visit - 09/09/2014 Dinner)",1
5,"The food was amazing.  I mean amazing.  Crazy expensive as well, but amazing.  The must-try options are the pan seared black cod which is perfectly cooked and full of great flavour, and the yellowtail sashimi in jalapeño sauce.  Cocktails are made perfectly and service is perfect, as expected for the price.  If you're paying, take the cash for a night out and just buy a month's worth of groceries, but if someone else is buying, prepare yourself by not eating for a few days in advance and order everything on the menu because it's that good.",1
4,"Alright, haters! 
To say that the food at this specific Nobu is bad is CRAZY. The ambiance might be stuck up and unfriendly, the staff is definitely pushing to make you order as much as humanly possible, the decor is not jaw dropping, I will give you that. But the FOOD is amazing, and I can generalize on the subject not only because I have been there a lot of times, but because the last time we went, in 5, we were a little drunk and very late, so we had to just go ahead and order before the kitchen would close, and so we ORDERED. EVERYTHING. TWO of everything. 
Our check was over 1200 gbp for five people, so you can imagine the sheer amount of comida. ALL good. I am strict and relatively harsh on my reviews, but haters, don't be hatin on NOBU! it's stuck up, pricey and pushy, but you are guaranteed a divine meal.",1
4,"I love Nobu in London.  It's in the Metropolitan hotel, which is a fun, upscale hotel in the great area of Park Lane.  The food is great.  Service can be hit or miss but it's generally very good.",1
5,"Quality is ace, great service, best Old Fashioned I've ever had.",1
4,"The quality of the food at this well known and respected restaurant can't be faulted. They managed to bring extraordinary flavor and taste to octopus, a difficult task.  Every dish was well prepared and elegantly presented. I greatly enjoyed the caviar infused martini but then again I rarely meet a crisp, cold and dry martini I don't like. ( we can talk about dirty martinis later). 
Here's where I do find fault: while the service was excellent - despite the fact that the place was very busy - management has devised a clever way to add $10 to the bill. They initially offer water and immediately open and provide bottled water. Add that to the bill and the ""optional"" 15 percent tip and VAT, well you take my point, a fairly substantial bill (worth it) becomes one $13 plus dollars higher. 
So, if you eat here, and you should, have an extra martini and say: tap water please. You can always drink water at the hotel or at home. You will survive and be happier in the long run. 
That said, back home soon to barbecue and bourbon but I do sound fancier when I'm in London.",1
5,One of the best meal I have ever had! Service was outstanding and every dish was unique and fantastic! Definitely a must try,1
2,"Not inedible, but just average by even San Francisco standards. Out the door for 235 pounds. 
Not again.",-1
5,"Amazing food, very consistent. Everyone loves Nobu. My favorite dish is the sea bass carpaccio with dried miso",1
3,"Their raw food's excellent, the rest is only so-so.
Came here for lunch on a Sunday and the first things that struck me was the number of children under the age of 10. They ordered the £42 miso black cod without thinking twice and knew the menu by heart. Unreal.
The decor's quite minimal with a few japanese flower arrangements on the larger tables and while not unpleasant, having heard so much about this place I thought it'd be grander. Similarly, service could've been better. Given the number of wait staff walking around, nothing much seemed to be happening. They check all the boxes in terms of refilling your glass, taking your order, but something's still lacking--personality. It all seemed quite mechanical, like you'd expect at a chain (which I guess this is).
It took quite a while for the food to arrive but the sushi was definitely worth the wait. Very fresh, great selection. The negi toro cut roll was superb and the seaweed was crispy. The scallop sushi was sweet and smooth and they were huge! The mackerel sushi was also really good--oily with some bite. You get two thin slices on the rice instead of one thick slice, which is much more enjoyable texture-wise. We also ordered the snow crab in creamy spicy sauce, which looked a lot like a cheesy pasta bake. On its own the crab was so tasty but there was too much sauce which totally masked the flavour of the crab! :(( The rock shrimp tempura with ponzu sauce were even more disappointing. Although the serving was huge and you could tell the prawns were fresh, you could taste and feel the oil. The ponzu sauce made them so soggy that the batter would peel off as your chopsticks touched it. And you could hardly taste the sauce! When you could, it was delicious, but that rarely happened. I feel like it's the sort of dish that you'd order to keep ravenous teenage boys full on a 'budget'.
I probably wouldn't be coming back. The quality of their sushi's top tier but at that price, you can get equally fresh sushi elsewhere in London. No reason to come to this particular restaurant other than to say you've dined at Nobu.",-1
3,"BOTTOM LINE: Whilst it *definitely* ain't Kaji (Toronto) in terms of quality or creativity, the dishes are solid (but not mind-blowing) and the price factors in star-gazing opportunities.
Cost:
-£63 (~$101 CAD at time of writing) for the standard seven-course omakase (tax & mandatory 10% tip included).
Atmosphere/Decor:
-I sat at the bar where I could watch the chefs work, and whilst they were all solid (some more than others), none could compare to chef Kaji.  Whilst I realize that these guys have to prepare for more people, it just makes you appreciate how much time and care chef Kaji places into its few.  Sorry if this review is turning into an indirect one for Kaji Sushi.  :P
Ordered:
-There's your standard menu where you can order individual items and a choice of two omakase: the standard £55 one and the more ""creative"" £65 one.  I ordered the standard one:
1. Tuna tartare with special peach - The tuna was fresh, but perhaps the best part was the peach!
2. Tuna salad with shrimp - The dressing was a bit strong and hid the flavour of the tuna, and the shrimp looked and tasty somewhat bland.
3. Black cod miso - Everybody seems to rave about this as the *BEST* thing ever, and whilst it's well done, I just don't understand the hype.  Many standard Chinese restaurants can steam / grill all kinds of fishes that are just as good.  A nice touch was the tasty rod of white ginger.
4. Scottish beef tataki - As per its name, the beef was nicely seared on the outside and placed on a sizzling plate with fresh asparagus and enoki / shitake mushrooms.  The sauce was much too salty for me, but it was interesting to eat different slices of beef at various levels of 'well-doneness"".
5. Sushi platter - Standard sushi with nice rolls made from soft shell crab and asparagus.
6. Miso soup - Does this really count as a course?
7. Cappuccino icecream - You can't really go wrong with this!
-As a side note, I tried Nobu Miami a few years ago and it was good to see my favourite dish - yellowtail with jalapeno - still on the menu. I wished I had the appetite to order it again!
Service:
-Staff were friendly, if not a bit detached, and the dishes were served at a good pace.  No complaints.",-1
4,"There's no way around it: Nobu has the best Japanese food I have (yet) had in London. All the fish is so incredibly delicious, so flavorful and perfectly cooked/not cooked/marinated/spiced....just absolutely divine. 
My favorite dishes:
-Raw oysters: Seasoned perfectly with a delicious, light, sauce. Not to mention the presentation of the dish was gorgeous.
-Yellowtail sashimi: I've had a LOT of yellowtail, and this was the most incredible yellowtail I have ever had. Also seasoned to perfection.
-Black cod: Char-grilled and served over a bed of greens. So delicious and unlike any fish I had ever experienced.
For desert I enjoyed the frozen yogurt with fresh berries and some kind of incredible sauce. Supposedly they made a fresh batch of the yogurt every four hours. I am a hardcore froyo addict, and I had never experienced anything quite like",1
5,"With the reputation and fame of Nobu, it's hard to think that I haven't heard of it before coming here! I ended up here for dinner almost by accident without any expectation.
Decided to take the chef's choice ""Omakase"" at  £95 (add Sake to it and you'll get the most expensive per person meal I ever had)... it was quite a treat to say the least with every plate an experience in itself. A quite unique fusion between Japanese and South American is what you'll get here if you try this option. This clearly a chef's restaurant with innovative dishes, not a traditional sushi place.",1
3,"I was distracted from the food experience by my fellow diners on a Sunday lunch.  
Oh look, here comes a Birkin bag, with its friend, the Prada bag.  Oh wait!  here's another Birkin!  Is that ALLIGATOR?  and what about this table, 3 dudes about 20 years old, is that one wearing a $25,000 watch?  
I get the sneaking suspicion people are about 'seeing and being seen' more than culinary experience.
as for the food -- had the bento lunch.  There was a TON of food (too much, in my opinion).  and yeah, that black cod in miso is pretty good.  And actually the sushi is among the best I have had.  in fact the sushi is why I'm giving this 3 stars instead of two.  
If you want decent Japanese food I'd suggest looking elsewhere. 
If you want a Michelin starred lunch, there are better choices in London.
If you want to show off your new handbag as you leap out of your Bentley at lunchtime, book a table here.",-1
4,One of the better nobu's I've ever been to. Extremely friendly staff will definitely visit again.,1
3,"Nobu is a reputable brand known for it's quality foods and elegance worldwide, however Nobu London has fallen short in delivering the same quality found in it's American counterpart.
I've been told not all Nobu's are the same, especially if you've eaten at their New York or Los Angeles restaurant you'll most likely be disappointed. Location is good, situated in the posh parts of London Old Park Lane, Mayfair. Decor was mediocre; not their usual modern-ellegant 5-star themed interior design. Since it wasn't busy when we went service was good, prompt, & a bit over staffed. Food was reasonable for England, fresh, tasty and it really is the best Japanese food restaurant around just don't go comparing it to the US. 
Note: Unless you have money to spend (£70-100 per person) or familiar with the Nobu brand then I wouldn't recommend it value for money.",-1
1,"If I could no stars for the head asian hostess I would. Very rude and not welcoming by any means. She needs to be retrained to work at the front. After speaking with many people, apparently they have gotten the same treatment. What a shame for a restaurant to have one person cause so many customers to leave and return their establishment over that type of behavior.
The food is slowly going downhill too. It used to be much better! Time to redo the menu.",-1
4,I've been to a couple Nobu restaurants - Nobu London is my favorite.  Sushi is good as expected but the dishes are where Nobu differentiates itself.  share / do family style so to try more dishes.  Pan Fried Dover Sole with Red Chilli Shiso Salsa was pretty unique.,1
4,"this place should be a 5 star place.  but i feel like its on of those places that has gotten too big too fast, the service actually can't keep up with their reputation.  This was the meal we looked forward to when we got to london.  in fact, we were shocked when we got a saturday night reservation! Actually, other meals surpassed this., by far.  
the actual sushi and fish was amazing...probably the freshest I have ever tasted....got the toro, toro-o, yellow tail and salmon.  We also got two rolls, the lobster tacos (yay!) and the ceviche...which was ok.  The cocktail list was good, the wine list great, but the sake list was small...the reserve premium sakes almost non-existent.  Then when the waiter brought our sake he put it in an ice bucket and left.  Uh...you are supposed to pour our sake, its tradition.  Maybe ill be back to a different nobu...heard they are opening a hotel in vegas.  But I won't be back to this one, and i will not choose nobu as a special occasion again...",1
4,"The Service in every Nobu Restaurant is outstanding as for in London and food overall great but not internationally supreme in the way that Nobu is reputed to be as as my dinner in Nobu New York was far better. I would recommend to go there for lunch as it is not too noisy and you can enjoy your sushi. Quality of the sushi was excellent but I have to complain that the pieces of the sashimi are too thin to really justify the price. Service was outstanding, it is a real plus never having to wave down waiters and to know that whatever you ask for would be delivered without being forgotten about.",1
5,"Beautifully prepared sushi, a real indulgence, and toro I will not soon forget. No cheap of course, but who'd expect it to be? I certainly don't consider visiting Nobu essential in your search for great sushi but it's definitely worth a visit.",1
5,"The omakase was amazing (8 or 9 courses of deliciousness, I stopped counting after 4 courses).  The fish was sublime and fresh.  A couple of courses were ordinary (miso soup, sushi) but the rest of the courses more than made up for this, very creative and different.
Mojito's are very good (I had Pear & cinnamon).
Tip- do not turn up late if you're ordering the omakase.  They are heavily booked and hence very strict with their two hour seatings.  Due to a mix-up I was 25 minutes late and the last few courses felt a little rushed.",1
4,"4 stars for food, 3 starts for service & ambience. 
They offered 2 Tasting Menus: One traditional and another contemporary.
I am glad that each of us had the different one and shared everything.
Every dish was FANTASTIC: Well-prepared and gratifying.
What was missing was a bit of creativity, which compensated 
REALLY WELL with traditional side of Japanese cuisine. 
The service and ambience were medium scale restaurant level:
Limited-attentiveness, extremely casual & loud crowds with 
Nordstrom department-food-court decor. 
Since I enjoyed the Tasting Menu dishes, I do not mind trying their 
NY and Tokyo locations.",1
4,"I LOVE Nobu, I have been to 4 locations and plan to go to many more. The highlights
Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno- amazing
toro sashimi with wasabi sauce(not sure of the name)- thought that i had ordered something else(different menus at different nobus) it was amazing... we ordered another order of it.",1
5,"Nothing more can be said about this place then hasn't been said.  Great meal, I brought a party of 6 here and let the waitress just keep bringing us food, nothing was bad, it was all outstanding!",1
3,"Bottom-line-up-front: it's very solid japanese seafood, but the hype is so overbearing it crushes the place. The surroundings are... not my scene.
The vibe is basically that of any of the major Asian carriers' business-class lounges at LAX, but with more 60 year old men with 23 year old women.
The waiters are knowledgeable, and the menu is fairly impressive.
Advice: stick with the specialty cooked dishes, the sushi is nothing special. trust your waiter. get a view of the people, not the park - the former are infinitely more entertaining.",-1
5,"I want to take Nobu behind the middle school and get it pregnant, thats how much I like it. 
This restaurant is without a doubt my favorite place to eat and drink. It brings japanese fusion and cocktails to a new level that make me feel that other food just isn't worth eating if it isn't as great as the level that Nobu takes cuisine to. 
I had a japanese mojito as recommended by the waitress, it was a mojito with a hint of vanilla, which turned out to be an absolute gold mine. 
My friends who I went with has been to every location of Nobu's now and did all of the ordering, so I couldn't tell you exactly which dishes to order, however I doubt that you could go wrong. I recommend the flash fried shrimp and any of the fish dishes. 
It is rather expensive, but I would dare to say worth the money if your wallet is big enough.",1
5,"My favorite restaurant in London especially for special events.  Recently my wife and I brought my brother, sister-in-law, niece and wife's best friend from the US to Nobu.  We each ordered one of the omakase tasting menus.  The food was outstanding.  The black cod is the best I've had anywhere in the world including Japan.  You must try this wonderful gem of a restaurant.",1
4,"It's only taken me 13 years to get around to eating at this eponymous eatery. Not knowing the lay of the land, while strolling in from the rain it's hard not to think when you check in your coat on the ground floor, whether that cloakroom was 'the place' that Boris Becker had his 'moment of madness'. But stroll up the stairwell and you're greeted by (for the most part) uber efficient front of house staff in a light and airy dining room with large windows that provide a panoramic view of Park Lane. Not my favourite part of town, and certainly not as convenient location wise for me, per se.
I'm gonna say it, but wasn't keen on the somewhat unnecessarily loud 'nameste' style greeting that is chanted to you by staff when you enter the actual dining area. Because ultimately that means you have to hear it many more times after you're seated! 
We sat at a window banquette and like Berkeley Street, the tables are SMALL! Food wise for me the tempura while expensive remains a must (a perfect case in point that quality over quantity wins the day). And my spicy garlic vegetable Donburi was extremely delicious and generous (I almost finished it all). 
Although you can't help but think, despite the Michelin star, at the end of the day, my meal format at a linear level was akin to an (admittedly) upscale Wagamama Yasai Cha Han, right down to the sides of Miso soup and plate of pickles (or maybe Waga's is copying Nobu?) 
My friend's Bento Box though was in a class of its own, both in presentation and the vast array of foods on offer including the signature black cod. She also ordered her favourite drink, a watermelon Martini (which you won't find in a Wagas!), which she swears by. I opted for a more pedestrian Diet Coke and tap water, because let's be honest the Fijian mineral water they serve is a rip off and pure marketing hype. The carbon footprint must be horrendous.
The dining room was busy, but I reckon you could have walked in without a reservation. Times are hard, it seems, even for Nobu. I'd be tempted to go there for a (special) dinner date, but for lunch I'd probably stick to Berkeley Street.",1
2,"Our experience @ Nobu London was pretty disaster.  Don't worry about Nobu London, there are better high end sushi restaurants in London.  Just look at the picture I uploaded, the sashimi was pretty unappetite, the toro are fat toro but it wasn't a very nice piece and presentation was just so so.  I had been to other Nobu & Matsushiha in Beverly Hills, by comparions Nobu London was a disaster.  Services was ok, it was very slow and under attended during our visit but it doesn't bother me too much since I am very busy checking out all the high fashion people.   Seen and be seen is the only positive star I can think of.   Don't worry about the bill, it's expected you are weathly to dine there, 100 pounds per head minimum, we wasted closed to 300 pounds for 2 there and I wasn't rich, it was a mistake !
BTW, how come only people from the US write about Nobu London, no one from London writes about them.  Either they know it's a place to avoid or this place is really a trap for tourist ... especially from the US of A.
:-)",-1
5,"We had a great experience, which was defined above all by the food. We loved every dish, full of subtle flavours and presented beautifully. It's certainly not cheap - £80 for the 'set meal' (before the pricey drinks), but they can charge this because they make the food like pieces of artwork.
Whilst I'd prefer to give the restaurant 90% rather than 100% (the food was mainly fantastic, but a couple of dishes were only 'really good'), giving an 80% would seem unfair. This is clearly a place for foodies with a sense of style. I won't be back every week, or even every couple of months, but I will plan another visit at some point. It's a place for special occasions.
Service was good - polite and friendly. I know some have said the service is mediocre or poor, but we were very happy with the attention we received. The ambience was classy, but not romantic. There was a bit of a buzz, a bit of a vibe, and it felt good to be sitting by a window looking out towards Hyde Park. I bet it would be even better on a summer evening at dusk. 
Overall, I've given a 5 out of 5, as it's the best dining experience I've had in a long time. I'd highly recommend for those looking for something a bit special.",1
5,"I used to work in Ubon by Nobu in canary warf so i've had plenty of opportunity to taste the food and i recently came back to London so i've tried this Nobu and the food and cocktails are just great. My Highlights are:
Yellowtail sashimi with Jalapeno, Rock shrimp tempura, Beef Toban, Black cod, Pan fried dover sole with shizo salsa and the chocolate bento box Loads of other dishes are amazing too, it's pricy but worth it for such a culinary art!",1
3,"Disappointed. This is a great brand and the Honolulu location blew me away twice last year. It could be the crowd, the new staff or both. The food is fine, but the service has slipped a bit and it's not because of lack of people. There were plenty of them standing around.  It just doesn't have the energy it used to or of the other locations. Nobu, this one needs some attention.",-1
5,"Master Nobu, you are the best. I love the place. yes, it is expensive and some dishes are really a little too steep but the place is worth it, if you like fusion Japanese food.
 I have had the chance of experiencing Nobu in London, Tokyo and Los Angeles (Matsuhisa). They are both excellent and have the same menu. My favorite by far is the LA one as the croud is far less ""wannabe"" than the London Met Hotel one.
 Nobu Matsuhisa is a really creative chef and the must tries in my eyes are: black cod with miso, the new style sashimi, Sashimi Salad with Matsuhisa Dressing, Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy Sauce, any tempura (avocado and sweet potato are my favorites), Beef Toban Yaki... and of course the very very good sake!
 One of my favorite restaurants in the world.",1
4,"I was attracted to try Nobu for the first time because..I like Robert de Niro
(such an admirable actor) and also because i love Japanese cuisine! Heard so many good words about it , that had to try it myself- and i wasn't disappointed! its superb, in any aspect -the location, the service, the atmosphere, the diners, and of course  the food! The flavours, the variety, the authentic scents and spices , made me feel as if I'm at the heart Tokyo, in one of the finest restaurants there. Magnificent and very rewarding dining experience  the only thing that could have topped it up was seeing Robert de Niro in the flesh",1
3,I do not think they provide sushi in good quality especially compared with Japan. And it's a bit noisy at night. The sauce and ginger are too salty to eat with sushi. Not A good choice considering its price.,-1
4,"I was here in Jan 2011 so this review is based on my visit then.  
Great quality, great service, Although the lights were a little bright.  
This one is much better than Nobu Berkeley by far and one of the better Nobu restaurants (compared to Honolulu, Malibu that were good but not worth the extra cash)",1
1,"Pretentious, overpriced ""japanese"" food. I mean seriously, black cod with miso for 42 quid!? You can get this dish in most family style japanese restaurant for MUCH less. The fish here is supplied by Atari- Ya in Bond street, which has some of the cheapest sushi/sashimi to be had in London, so here they decide to pretty much destroy the natural flavour of the raw fish by adding all sorts of crazy sauces... (easy way to cover up if the fish isnt the freshest)
""Chocolate Bento Box"" is basically the most widely available american dessert-chocolate lava cake. Its put into a bento box with green tea ice cream... pretty much tastes like every other lava cake out there.
Save your money and go somewhere else.... ANYWHERE else. You wont see any japanese go anywhere near Nobu, with good reason.",-1
5,"I've never been much of a 'fine diner'. My long-term boyfriend is an ex-chef for Gordon Ramsay so often I get Michelin-star food in the comfort of my own home which is a lovely bonus! However, for my 21st birthday my family took us to Nobu - a restaurant I have lusted after (and hinted to my boyfriend about!) for many years.
 The atmosphere is lively and fairly casual which wasn't what I was expecting but it made the whole experience much more enjoyable as we were all chatting and laughing without any evil glares from the richer patrons.
 The food, needless to say, was absolutely divine - my favourite dishes which I recommend to EVERYONE are: Yellowtail Tuna Tataki with jalapenos, beef sashimi, wagyu beef, shrimp tempura, black code with miso and Choclate Bento Box to finish. Don't be swayed by anything else on the lengthy dessert menu - I had to send back to Mexican Chocolate Cake as I had massive food envy after seeing my mother and sisters Bento boxes! The food comes all at once and they make it really easy to share dishes (we had plates passing around all 5 of us all evening long) and it's better that way as you get to taste a little bit of everything.
 Impeccable service, lovely cocktails, great ambience - if I was a millionaire I'd dine here everyday!",1
3,Good -- not great quality. Very Expensive. Beware.,-1
4,"5 stars for food, 4 stars for ambience, and 4 stars for service.   My companions and I had some wonderful food, I initially liked the Namaste greeting but then it got old as I had to hear it a lot during my meal.  Theu had cheap wooden chopsticks that you get at any chinese takeaway and had to break up on your own and get wood splinters, c'mon Nobu...I would cut you some slack if I went there for lunch but this is dinner.  I asked for real chopsticks and received a puzzled look.  My friend asked for a black cloth napkin as she had black slacks on, again..another bewildering look from servers.  All that being said, the food was wonderful.  We shared some sushi rolls for appys, I had tempura, yum. My friend raved about the black cod.  The desert selection was incredible and artistically served.  Oh, and the cocktails were delicious too although could have been stronger.  All in all a wonderful dining experience.  :)
Getting a 4 because Nobu Las Vegas was better.  You should still check this out :)",1
3,Good sushi but overpriced.  Certainly not worth going to if you're visiting and live somewhere where you can get quality sushi anytime.,-1
5,"Of the two Nobu's in London I prefer this one for the dining experience.
The bottom line (lets get this out of the way) .....Yes it is pricey... Whooohooo yes sir it is. But I say worth it.
Now unless you are well off enough to eat here on a regular basis without needing to re-mortgage (good luck in this economy) this is ideal for special occasions for the hoi polloi....anniversaries...dates.... celebrations etc
Of the four times I have been the food has been spot on. I have always left sated and glad to have been. You cannot ask for more.",1
4,"Back in California i would have a craving for sushi about once a week. funny enough though, at my favorite Japanese places, i would always stray more towards the other dishes, because  they would just be amazing.
such was the case with Nobu. yes the sushi was amazing. fresh, tasteful, gorgeous, all that. but it was the other plates that blew me away. they had this deep fried full fish thing.... holy hell. it was filleted, so the meat was sitting directly in the sauce (the sauce.... hmmm... in my world, everything is just a vehicle for the sauce....) and the bones were fried so you could actually eat them like a crunchy snack. i was skeptical, but it was amazing.
funny enough, the food isnt as pricey as it could have been. i'll tell you what gets you: its the cocktails that bump up the bill. amazing drink list. and the servers just know when to show up at your elbow and say ""would you like another?"" and of course you would, if you *should* or not. 
my one issue: the decor and space felt very... lacking? cold? corporate? it needed something. yes i know its in a hotel, but really do we need to be reminded of it? at a place like this, the whole thing should be an experience. a change to get away from the ordinary.
but anywho. still...
sigh.
nobu. till we meet again.",1
5,Sometimes the seafood gives a strange feeling in my mouth. But the sushi there is simply delicious. I like the variety of food in this restaurant and I'm planning to go there soon.,1
5,For first class delicious Japanese cuisine this takes some beating. this is where to bring someone you want to impress-the food and service is excellent and the desserts to die for.,1
3,"Excellent tempura and black bean Dover sole
Food was good but Service was not very good
Sushi came out incorrect but they fixed it
One meal came out more than five minutes after the other two meals",-1
5,"I have been to several branches of Nobu and the Mayfair location is my absolute favo(u)rite.
My mom and I went and sat at the sushi bar. We ordered the chef's sushi dinner and plenty of saketinis. Everything was fabulous. The fish was as fresh as what I ate in Japan and everything was seasoned perfectly. Coincidentally, this was also my first Nobu experience. Maybe the sentimentality is tainting my perception... Haha.",1
5,"Always superb and special. Its the elegant high end side of sushi but as a sushi addict, if I could afford to eat here every day I would. cant remember when I 1st went- many moons ago, but if you want to treat someone special (if any of my friends read this review take note!!) then you cant go wrong with Nobu xx",1
4,"Sure, Nobu has great sushi - super fresh, good variety, but you don't come to Nobu to eat sushi. You go to have his superb Peruvian-Japanese inspired dishes. The famous black cod with miso is famous for a reason - it's really good. Soft, light, flaky cod smothered in salty, earthy miso paste satisfies that part of you that can never get full from eating raw fish. Another stand out dish is the seared kobe steak, seared rare, with some delicious alcohol-based sauce. The fat from the steak is for sure an artery clogger, but it almost melts in your mouth. Very, very tasty.
The decor leaves something to be desired - it's rather plain, but then almost all Nobu restaurants are rather plain. It's perhaps a nod to the zen-like simplicity of Japanese decor, and almost a reminder to focus on your food.",1
3,"Not a meal for the sustainably minded, that's for sure. Only the popular fish get any attention at this celebrity luncheon spot. And wow this place is expensive! (£60pp for lunch). I will say that the food and drinks were really nice. The bar serves a surprisingly subtle bloody Mary with wasabi and tankatsu sauce. I'll definitely be making this one at home, so thanks for the inspiration! 
Sadly I couldn't justify spending £32 for their signature black cod with miso. Instead I had a Latin spiced ribeye over rice, which was a delightfully spicy riff on the Japanese meat over rice dishes like katsudon and unagidon. On the more traditional end, my lady had the prixe-fixe sushi lunch, which featured only the highest quality designer fish (like bluefin and wild salmon). The hand rolled maki (the lady called them Japanese tacos) were particularly delicious. 
The low point for me was cultural... while the excellent service made me feel like I was getting my money's worth, it's make me wiggle when all the servers yell ""irashaimase"" when customers walk in and there's not a Japanese soul in sight.",-1
4,"I've been to Nobu in NYC and Vegas and decided on this location, which my wife told me was ""less of a scene"" than the other London location. I love the food here. Fresh, light, creative and spicy. 
We started with some sushi, which is always excellent here. We had spicy tuna and a California roll. It was as good as sushi can be in my book. We then chose a selection of small plates as we always do, instead of going with the larger entree portion. Grilled Asparagus with spicy salsa was an exciting opener. The always delectable rock shrimp in vinegary Ponzu sauce followed and reinforced its claim as the best selection at Nobu. Squid ""pasta"" with asparagus and shitake mushrooms in an oyster sauce has become another dependable selection that we enjoyed. Our last small dish was Peruvian Spicy Chicken skewers, which brought the heat. The staff was helpful with our wine selection and we went with a nice fruity white that balanced the heat of our dishes nicely. They also kept the wine flow perfectly measured with our meal. and it lasted for our entire dinner. We finished with the Fuji apple, which we enjoyed very much. 
Always the scene, this Nobu location did not disappoint either. There were certainly a few very large tables of glitterati and scenesters and I have never seen dresses and skirts like that outside of Vegas. However, my wife and I were able to have a delicious meal and had no problem hearing each other or being too crowded. 
The one thing I don't get is what is up with the bar. We arrived on time for our reservation and although the restaurant had just opened and was empty, we were shuffled off to their bar/lounge. I'm here for dinner and am going to put away at least one bottle of wine easy. I guess if cocktails are your thing this probably wouldn't bother you, but I looked at it as a delaying annoyance of padding the bill with overpriced drinks. My wife and I always get a kick out of places that are part club and part restaurant. As the saying goes ""a jack of all trades is a master of none."" 
That said, I was here to eat and it lived up to every great memory I have had of dining at Nobu. Excellent food and impeccable service. Enjoy.",1
5,"Yummy yummy yummy!!!!   I am so much more a fan of this location of Nobu than Barkeley Square.  Everything I tried was absolutely delicious.  This was the first time eating in Nobu that I did not go heavy on the sushi, and I was blown away!!!",1
4,"If you have the money, and you want some good sushi, go to Nobu. It's nothing particularly special and the atmosphere is casual and relaxed.
PS- Always go to Nobu Berkeley, not this one.",1
4,"I rate it a 4 for the generous serving and authentic taste. Though to be honest, I appreciated the quality/flavors of the Japanese food I had at another Japanese restaurant of less prestige called Miyama on Clarges Street.",1
3,"Went there with two friends, for lunch they have the set menu for 26 quid. I was really courious because it's such a famous place, it has to be THE BEST.
We tried the luncheon menu with beef in wasabi sauce, a mixed sushi and sashimi lunch and their signature dish, highly recomended by the waitress: the balck cod everithing with the sake tasting.
The food is really good, fresh, amazing flavours.
The cod was surprisingly delicious, perfectly cooked and with a lovely subtle sweet flavour.
I have to say NOBU has god a way with dressing sauces, everithing was so well balanced and delicious, even the salad dressing (we've been told that's made with 10 ingredients, the main 3 are onions, black pepper and japanese mustard).
The beef was perfectly cooked and the wasabi sauce simply delicious.
And I'm still thinking about the mouthwatering of the tuna.... sooooo good.
Then we tried a bento chocolate box wich is practically a choccolate souffle', served warm with green tea ice cream on the side.
The souffle' was perfect, light and crunchy outside with a warm creamy heart. And the ice cream itself was really nice, gentle taste.
But the match of them wasn't right for me, the ice cream is just too delicate for the choccolate flavour. It's just not right, the ice cream disappear on your mouth leaving only a cold sensation when you eat the two ingredient together.
The staff is really nice, our waitress has been very helpful.
Still I didn't like that they cleaned the plates away without asking if we were done (they took away the salad I was slowly enjoying on the side of everything else).
They gave us the wrong beef at the beginning, and even if everything was really good, I definitely have to say that is overpriced. It's true you're in central London and you're overlooking hide park but this is not a good reason to let me pay 32 quid for a portion of cod!!
A special mention for the toilet which are pretty small (specially because are shared with the meetings room on the 1st floor, but I find amazing the special make up side with armchairs, white light and mirrors to retouch your make up.
Still I think whenever I want to eat great japanese food I'll go back to TOSA in chiswick, same level of quality for half the price.",-1
5,"Have eaten at Nobu quite often and have to say that it is unfailingly excellent if horribly expensive...the portions are tiny so you'll end up ordering quite a few dishes and spend more than you meant to but as with everything in life............ you get what you pay for.
 Try to aviod ordering the things you are familiar with and stray from the beaten track....the wait staff are delighted to oblige....the pork belly was just incredible...cooked perfectly with the fat melting into the meat...also love love love the tempura, light as a feather....
 It's not just about the food, the atmosphere always good with an expectant air of A list spotting never too far away....appropriate attire for a night out for a girl is tight jeans...sky scraper heels and a sparkly/sexy top.....which will take you nicely down to the Met Bar for a cocktail and a bop.",1
4,"Nobu is definitely one of the best restaurants I have been lucky enough to try in London. Although just some of the full height windows benefit of the view on Hide Park, the inside environment is intriguing and pleasant; the designer managed to mix a contemporary-fashion style preserving a easily perceivable Japanese influence. While waiting to be seated at the table, one can enjoy a cold glass of champagne in the comfortable love-seats in the waiting area. Wine list absolutely remarkable although the waiters tend to pour too much wine in a single time. Had delicious fresh filleted tuna and desserts but what absolutely stood out was the black cod. Apart from the exquisite taste, smoked at the right point, it literally melts in your mouth. The black cod is definitely the reason that makes me want to be back. One caveat: when one walks through the glass doors of The Metropolitan Hotel, he has to be aware that his dinner will most likely be very expensive. However, Nobu fully deserves both its Michelin star and the price paid for some of the plates.",1
1,"Went there one night on our vacation last week. The restaurant was around the corner from our hotel. I have been to numerous nobu restaurants and i can't believe that this is a nobu. are all the other reviewers blind to the decor. half the experience of a restaurant is the experience and ambiance. this truly looks like a cafeteria. there is literally nothing on the walls, the tables and chairs are pine and there is zero ambiance...zero. the food was fine, but for the price...no way! i can't believe chef is putting his name on this restaurant. don't go.",-1
3,Discovered the place only last week. Sushi was excellent quality and my girlfriend was in love with the dessert. Very chic atmosphere. Great for once in a month treat.,-1
4,"doesn't top the NYC Nobu but does a good job of serving fabulous sushi in London
the scene was much more tacky/trashy at this one than I've ever seen in any of the NY locations, but think this is a function of the Eastern European / Middle Eastern focused wealth in London. 
risk: too much mink with your sushi
reward: delicious Nobu staples across the pond",1
3,"Extremely expensive, more expensive than America. Cool ambiance. Good service, good attitude, beautiful sighteseeing, a view to Hyde Park.  It was the most expensive almost 400 pounds for two. Around 8 plates and a bottle of wine.",-1
4,"4.5 stars. really - it was quite excellent.
we had the steak starter, a bamboo with chilled sake, king crab claw, scallops in spicy sauce, tempura roll, and i'm totally forgetting what else.
everything was so good. the steak was amazing - i literally wanted to lick the plate but then i remembered where i was (oops, silly american..). the three of us couldn't get over the tastes and how fresh everything was. 
definitely make reservations so you don't have to wait. i'd totally go back - except i'm 5400 miles away. ;)",1
2,"My experience here was nothing spectacular unfortunately.  Being sushi snob myself and having visited other Nobu locations (NY, LA, etc.) many times, I had to say this place did not meet my expectations.
I don't usually order stuff from regular menu and it works just fine at other Nobu locations, but the server here had no idea what I was trying to order.  I asked to speak to one of the Japanese chefs and the issue was immediately solved.  Still the sushi I had was nothing special.
Considering the price I paid, I had way better experience at Zuma for sure...",-1
4,"I was glad I stopped here for dinner after s long walk about in London. I was hot, tired and hungry. Unfortunately, their air conditioning was not quite up to par. I sat at the sushi bar and had a gat conversation with the Japanese young lady who served me. The sushi was fresh albeit small for my standards. The restaurant was busy and the staff professional and very friendly. Pricey but in line with their quality and level of staff.",1
5,No better sushi ... perhaps my best meals ever are eaten here.,1
1,"This was fantastic. 20 year ago. Now it's seriously overcrowded, the staff think they are too cool to be even remotely polite to non-celebs and the food is not a patch on the much better Nobu Berkeley (the one where the celebs actually go). Thank God I'm teetotal so it was just irritatingly expensive rather than really annoying.",-1
3,"Took my 11 Y/O daughter for diner on Friday evening and managed to get a table without a reservation.
 She's a real sushi lover so we wanted to try what is supposed to be the best and yes, it was very good. Everything tasted very freeh and the flavours were very crisp, but 200 quid for two of us, it ain't worth that!
 I will go back but not as often as I would have done if it didn't suffer from quite as much of the London hype as it does.",-1
4,"I love the Nobu I will miss it when I will leave London even if it will be a good thing for my economy.I did not see any celebrities but the food is so goooooood!! The best sushi and fresh food. 
Nice bar also and perfect sushi bar",1
4,"I went to Nobu a few months ago for lunch with a friend, and we had a lovely experience. We had a seat by the window overlooking Hyde Park, and it was a nice sunny day.
We had 3 dishes, some sushi/sashimi, dessert, and a couple of drinks each. The 3 dishes we ordered were - shrimp and lobster with spicy lemon sauce, pan fried dover sole with red chilli salsa, seafood toban yaki. We also ordered a selecton of sashimi - yellowtail, salmon, sea bream, mackerel, sweet shrimp. For dessert, we both had the chocolate bento box. I had a couple of mojitos with the meal, and my friend had a raspberry cooler.
Shrimp & lobster with spicy lemon sauce - A salad of fresh leaves and enoki mushrooms, topped with shrimp and chunky lobster pieces, and a tangy lemon sauce. The dish wasn't swimming in sauce, but there was enough to coat everything and it helped to lift the flavours of the shrimp and lobster. This was a perfect way to start the meal, as my tastebuds were now tingling.
Pan fried dover sole with red chilli salsa - this came out next, and I was blown away by the presentation. There were 4 fillets of fish, on a frosted glass plate, swimming in a red chilli salsa, and right in the middle, was the head and backbone of the fish, deep fried and curled up into a ""C"" shape, with the tail suspended in mid-air. The fish was nice and fresh, and again, the sauce was very tasty. Not overpoweringly spicy, but enough to make my tastebuds tingle. We wiped the plate clean.
Seafood ""toban"" yaki - this came out last, and I am glad they left it til the end. It was basically a flat claypot with a lid (the ""toban""), and when you opened it, the aroma that came out was unbelievable. It had a lovely savoury, vinegary smell, and inside the toban were clams, shrimp, fish, swimming in a lovely soy/vinegar sauce. The seafood was firm and fresh, and the sauce was the best of the 3 dishes. It was so good, for the remainder of the meal, I kept stopping to savour the smell as other tables had their ""toban"" yaki delivered to them. I really enjoyed this dish.
The sashimi came out next, and by comparison, the ""wow"" factor wasn't there, compared with the previous 3 dishes. The fish was definitely of good quality, but I suppose there wasn't much difference between Nobu's sashimi and other places I've been to (e.g. Inaho, Yoshino). As before, the fish was firm and fresh, but the sweet shrimp was slightly slimy. 
To finish, we had the chocolate bento box, and it was a chocolate fondant with a scoop of green tea ice cream in a bento box. The fondant itself was good, nice and warm with a lovely gooey, liquid centre. The ice cream was the best green tea ice cream I've had, it had a lovely deep smokey green tea flavour. A good way to end the meal.
I also had the vanilla and apple mojito, and the pear and cinnamon mojito. I enjoyed both, and preferred the apple over the pear, as the apple flavour was more distinct, compared with the pear. The glasses were quite generous, and the vodka was nice and strong.
The meal ended up costing over £200, which is quite expensive. I would definitely recommend their special dishes, but wouldn't necessarily go back for the sashimi, as you can get similar quality sashimi at other top japanese restaurants. Worth going to for a treat.",1
5,"It was our initial visit. Having spoke to good friends and examining the testimonials we had been quit eager for dining here. The service was extremely fine. Very attentive. The climate was satisfied yet inviting.They're going the extra distance to be certain their guests are content.This was the most amazing plate That i've ever had!I strongly recommend this restaurant for anyone who loves foodstuff. Very accomodating staff, and always there when you wish them.
The sushi chefs are fantastic and just serve the freshest sea food. I've recommended this restaurant to a lot of, lots of individuals and none have already been dissatisfied!!",1
5,"This is home away from home for me. The service is excellent, you're taken care of from the moment you enter the restaurant until you leave. Everything is delicious and made with the freshest and highest quality ingredients. You have to get the yellowtail sashimi with jalepeno, tuna tataki with ponzu, rock shrimp tempura with creamy spicy sauce, black cod with miso, and the chocolate bento box which is flourless chocolate lava cake with green tea ice cream. These items are just a few of my favorites, you can't go wrong with anything you order.",1
5,"I was lucky enough to be taken here for a corporate event, which meant a private room, someone else picking up the tab and the chance to try a bit of everything. All I can say is 'wow'. This is one place that lives up to the hype and (if it's possible) tops it. I'm not even a big fan of Japanese food, but you'd have to be mad not to love Nobu.
 I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you pick from the menu, but the famous black cod with miso lives up to its reputation, the yellowfin sashimi was absolutely outstanding, and the seared beef with spring onion and garlic chips left me speechless. I've never eaten so much raw or seared food in my life, but I am now completely converted.
 The staff were friendly, incredibly efficient and looked after us brilliantly, and I really can't fault the place for food and service.
 The main restaurant looked bustling and atmospheric from what I saw, with plenty of movers and shakers and an appearance from Kylie (or so the tramp outside told one of my fellow diners!)
 If you want a memorable dinner, this is definitely the place to go. Just bear in mind that everything you eat afterward will be a disappointment!",1
5,"I have been to both the Nobu restaurants in London, and this one is my favourite. The restaurant area is spacious, and the large windows all around one side provide a nice effect.
 As you would expect from a Nobu restaurant, the service is of a very high standard, and they really made me feel fussed over (I like that). We had various delicious dishes, and my favourite was definitely the black cod - that is my recommendation to anyone reading this review!
 I'm not at all interested in 'celebrity spotting', but for those of you that are, you are sure to spot some famous person or other in Nobu.",1
4,"This is the restaurant that changed the landscape forever. Japanese cuisine in London was almost non-existant and inedible 15 years ago and then Nobu came along and set the standard. It's still one of the best - simple, fresh and minimalist - not fussy. It's not 'fun' or particularly 'trendy' but it serves some of the highest quality sushi in the city. Ask them to deep fry the shrimp heads when you order amai ebi.",1
1,"While the Nobu (s) in California rock, this pretentious ""Overdressed Red Lobster"" is awful.  From the crappy drink I got at the bar to the snobby, anorexic hostess, I knew I was not in for a fun night.  I got sushi and several items I had loved at the Nobu in Malibu only to find that everything smelled ""fishy"" and the signature Black Cod with Miso was like eating a ""Dr. Scholls gel insole with Miso""....",-1
3,"HOW COME MY PREVIOUS REVIEW IS NOT SHOWING??
 anyway, 
Just wanted to say...
 I wonder if NOBU uses MSG in their food OR SAUSES. I keep getting a migrane EVERY SINGLE TIME after eating there. I DO NOT have food allergies and I do not drink alcohol. If I ask the metre'd, I'm sure they will say that they don't use MSG... I wonder...?",-1
5,"The first time in my life at Nobu London was in 1999, we were in London on a short break and had on the day the brilliant idea we want to go to Nobu, and got a table through a few pestering phone calls to a great friend and chef I know, he worked with Mark Edwards on some promotions. (Mark is sort of Global Head Chef and a partner of Nobu Matsuhisa, Nobu has 15+ places from LA to NYC, London to Hong Kong. These are part of the Myriad Restaurant Group, where Robert De Niro and Drew Nieporent are amongst the partners, all big playersthen there is a brand owned by Nobu himself, called Matsuhisa, more boutique style, all very complex and strategic)
 Back to our experience, I only realized once seated in the restaurant what a celebrity packed hotspot this was. We came from a Swiss mountain village, so this all in a sudden felt like being seated in the first row of a Film Premiere. Anyway, I don't think this interest anybody, the point is, today in 2007 the restaurant still has a great energy, buzz and nothing is inferior then it was back in 1999, except that the customer base is a touch less celeb-ish, more mixed, tourists, punters out for a great treat, business men, etc.
 Nobu London maintains a 1 Michelin Star since years, and still has one, the service is still very efficient, not always over the top friendly, but the prices are kept steep if not over the top. The Japanese Food with a twist of Peruvian influences is absolutely wonderful, the energy and vibrancy in the restaurant is world class. A magic place that has its price tag.
 If you go there, never miss the signature dishes that are part of the fame. Edamame beans, Yellowtail Jalapeno, Rock Shrimp Tempura (order with 3 sauces) or Creamy Spicy Shrimp, Black Cod Miso, and then have a selection of Sushi, it is top end, can't get much better then this outside Japan. No matter what, don't miss the desserts, they are a class of its own, from a pastry chef that worked for Adrian Ferra at El Bulli. To drink, maybe try a Bamboo pitcher of Junmai Daignjo quality Sake.
 I am not always convinced about the new dishes; they are great if one is a repeat customer dining often in Nobu, but for a one off treat, stick to the classics. The thing with the one off treat people is a bit reflected in the customer picture, at the steep prices i.e. for 2 people you easily hit the £200+ mark, and an exorbitant service charge knocked on top of the bill, understandable
 For quick and more affordable meals, the Sushi counter, where no reservations are taken, is also a great treat. You can get a good flavour of the buzz in the place around £110+ for two.
 Overall, it is an institution and there are newer places on the market, the likes of Zuma, who are for sure heavy competitors and have taken over some of Nobu's regular clientele and fame in the last years. In the end I think, one is a Nobu-san or Zuma-san, all depending on the first experience you had, maybe I am influenced from the 1999 one, and therefore definitely a Nobu-san.
 (""Nobu - The World's Sexiest Restaurant"" The Observer, April 2001)
 NB: Then there is the new Nobu Berkeley Street, for great food go to Park Lane, then for drinks to Berkeley, more clubby feel, the food is not the same, just the prices.",1
5,"This is one of the best Japanese restaurants I've ever been to. 
I went last month for a friends birthday and i had a brilliant meal and evening here.
The food was very well presented and even yummier than it looked. The only downside was the tiny tiny portions. I had a great sushi dish and the waiter recommended a wine - which happened to go with the meal very well indeed. One of my friends tried a black cod and i have to say it looked and tasted delicious. But my sushi was better ;)
 The staff are really helpful and friendly - not what you would expect in a ''celebrity hang out''.
 Our meal was expensive, myself and my partner put in £150 for the two of us.
 Was it worth it? Yes. Would i go again? Only if i couldnt find somewhere just as good but cheaper and without the off putting paparazzi outside!!",1
2,"I went to Nobu with a coworker and was looking forward to an excellent dinner. To start with, the restaurant is very posh, everyone looks better than you, but at least its dark so you can't quite be sure. I really do like the vibe and the music playing during dinner.
We decided to get a few sushi dishes (both nigiri and rolls), some cooked dishes (some tempura calamari, some sort of lobster, etc) and overall the food was just ok. I am from San Francisco and believe we have fresher tasting fish in the bay area.
If you plan on going, I would suggest to stick to a variety and ask for waiter recommendations (though ours, to be frank, was not very good at suggestions). Overall, if you remove the ambiance and good looking folks, this place is just mediocre, and I would have to say all hype.",-1
4,"This place is excellent because of their Sushi. The bar is very impressive and the sushi fresh and delicious. You can taste the quality.
Service is okay, but it takes some getting used to. Prices are above average but you can have as much or little as you want. :) Noone will stare at you for ordering only two pieces of Sushi!",1
3,"Nobu is London's own Nobu partly owned by Robert De Niro and a trendy spot with real sleek and minimal decor. 
Food is great, I recommend the Chef's menu with a variety of the restaurants dishes, all perfectly sized and superb in taste. 
Although prices are very expensive the restaurant is worth visiting if you can afford it. 
Luckily I was invited :)
It is one of the most talked about restaurants in London but not the best in my opinion.",-1
4,"U can't find anything nicer tha Nobu! I have tried a few Nobu in different countries and i am impressed with the one in London. Although the food isn't that surprising, nothing really particular. But the atmosphere of the restaurant is fabulous. I am a big fan of sushi and sashimi, basically a super fan of all sorts of japanese food. i think whoever loves japanese food should visit Nobu one day!!",1
5,The sushi was pretty damn fine here. My boys have been eating sushi since they were being potty-trained and they were most impressed. We ate at the sushi bar and were entertained by the mastery of the chefs. I have since eaten at Nobu's in NYC and this London location was much better in sushi quality and taste. This was a great meal to the end of our short trip to London. We'll be back--one day!,1
4,"Haven't tried Nobu in New York or Hawaii, but boy, did I have a nice meal here.  The BF had a business dinner elsewhere (and while usually I can wangle an invite, it wasn't to be, despite my belief that I'm the life of any party) (narcissist), and so I came here.  I ate at the sushi bar and met a great French guy eating alone too, so we ended having a very nice dinner and swapping restaurant recommendations in San Francisco, London, and Paris.  Just my kind of evening.  The food was excellent, and the restaurant was not snobbish at all.  (I'm so used to San Francisco low-key, and excess formality always hits me as, well, excessive, so it was very pleasant.)  The service was a bit stiff, but the sushi chefs were fantastic and warm.  Very enjoyable.",1
5,"I've only relatively recently started to expand my tastes in food and had tried Sushi elsewhere with some friends, I liked it but wasn't convinced one way or the other.
 However, I was fortunate enough to be taken to Nobu by the Chairman of my current business and it was a great evening. I may have been a bit lost on my own but he knew the ins and outs of the menu and ordered a selction of dishes that blew you away. When your not the most confident with new menus it really makes a difference to go with someone who really knows what he's talking about so my Nobu experience was really of the highest order.
 This was food on another level completely and really gave me an appreciation of what quality seafood is.
 My wife was more interested in if I'd spotted any celebs but it was a quiet evening on that front",1
4,This time they had removed Blue Fin from the menu because of it being endangered. i thought that was very responsible of them. They could just continue raking in a bundle and leave it on the menu- but they are doing the right thing. The new style sashimis are all awesome. Try them all.  it's the hamachi and jalapenos that have me coming back for more.,1
4,"I love me some Nobu and this location is one of the easier ones to get a reservation at or a walk in for the sushi bar. We ate here twice last week and as such I can say that the service was good, as was most of the food I ordered. The only downside was that they kept taking my menu from me despite my protests and that they also seemed to be impatient when we were ordering and not offering much help. That aside...I know what I like and had no problem finding a number of tasty dishes to satisfy my hunger. While this location is accessible I recommend the one in Mayfair, its a bit nicer and more upscale.",1
5,"Nobu had been on my restaurant hit list for quite some time when a friend was rewarded for some sterling work by her boss offering a rare carte blanche for her to dine wherever she liked, with a friend. Lucky for me, I was the friend. We somehow nabbed a Friday night reservation and kicked off with cocktails at the bar before being guided to a lovely table looking across to Hyde Park. Everything on the menu looked great, but when the waiter came to take our order and we looked up with those we can't decide faces, he kindly suggested we select the chef's tasting menu. What the hell! We weren't paying. 
The miso was delicious, the sushi fresh and sashimi dissolved on the tongue. The famous Nobu miso cod was just as good as we'd heard, with a subtle sweetness lingering after each bite and spicy prawns came sizzling to the table in an oh-so Japanese way. Finished off with the refreshing taste of green tea ice cream. Now Nobu has changed rank to my Restaurants to Hit Again Soon list. Warning - NOT credit crunch friendly unless some kind benefactor donates the cost of dinner here.",1
4,"I love visiting Nobu at The Met whenever I visit London. My must haves are 1 - 2 portions of the creamy spicy shrimps, black cod and the crab sushi.
With a dry cold sake.service is always good, I try to grab a bite when I arrive in London and usually manage to find a space at the bar.
It's slightly expensive but well worth the price.
Much better (according to me) than Nobu Tokyo.",1
4,"Nice place and good food, but a bit overpriced I find.",1
4,"Eaten here a number of times and it has always been very good. Black cod with miso is a must try, but the Dover sole is also excellent. Warm wild mushroom salad is also very nice. The novelty does, however, wear off after seeing the bill so try the Nobu bento box which is great value, has the black cod as a taster within, and at about £20 will not break the bank. Although the majority of the lunchtime guests are dressed very casual it can still seem a very formal restaurant so be prepared as the odd waiter can be a little off  guess the friendliest are sent to perform on x factor. Seriously though, a must visit for lunch just to taste some real tasty treats.",1
3,"Lovely restaurant, loved food and sake. i and my friends were there last week, I like it, of course I prefer Berkerley, it looks more romantic and chilled out place",-1
4,Good stuff.  Yellowtail blew me away.  Nice vibe.,1
5,What i fantastic experience i had here. Food always taste better when you dine in a stylish and modern place. the staff were pleasant and very helpful. I didnt expect how much the staff try to help you. A great place. Highly recommended.,1
5,"Great, great food. Never thought the dining space was that special and its a nightmare to get a table. But for once, it's one of those in-demand venues that you understand what the fuss is about. The food is outstanding. Sushi fresh and in the main hits the spot. The whole Peru/Japan fusion thing works really well too- I guess cos they're on either side of the Pacific! Everyone raves about the Black Cod. Yes, it is cliched to rate it. But I'm sorry, it IS out of this world.",1
5,"Pricy but still my absolutely favourite restaurant in the whole world. My favourite dish is the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos - YUMS! The sushi's great . . . the tempura with the three dipping sauces is divine. Lovely setting - great service, great food . . . what more could you want?",1
4,"I love the Nobu in Manhattan, and this (original) London outpost comes pretty close in terms of food quality. Sushi ranged from good to nearly great, plus a memorable salmon skin salad (though slightly too salty). Sakatinis were reliable and we had a decent onigoroshi sake which was good and not badly priced. Overall, a good place to eat, but be prepared to pay over the odds (just make a reservation for the New York branch instead - better value) and the ambience is somewhat hotel restaurant like. In summary, Nobu London epitomizes London - you get great stuff (food, service etc.) if you are prepared to pay, and pay. All your staff will be foreign (eastern Europe), well dressed and pleasant. I hope they get some of the massive tip revenues the place generates.",1
4,"If you're feeling fancy or want to impress someone, Nobu is your perfect destination. It has the best japanese food I have ever tasted. But the suroundings that you're eating in is the most impressive factor. It has a very clean, sleek feel to the restaurant and the view is one of the best in London, right out on to the beauty of Hyde park and the twinkling lights of Park lane.",1
5,"This is my favourite restaurant in London, and probably in the world, along with Nobu Berkley. Yes it is expensive but I went expecting that and it wasn't too much of a shock. It is possible to spend £200 for two people on just food here, if you go for things like the wagyu beef and lobster, but it is also possible to spend £60 going for the cheaper dishes. A must every time for me is the black cod with miso - it just melts in your mouth and the taste is exquisite - well worth the £26 price tag. Definitely recommend this restaurant.",1
1,"My experience here wasn't great. Very bad service, noisy. The food good but very expensive according the general value of the rest. Not really worth the high prices I don't think. Would have been better off going to another restaurant I think!",-1
5,Outstanding! Me and my parents went and the waiter offered to make us up a tasting menu. We got to try nearly everything and it was all absolutely amazing! Well worth the price and gives me faith in Michelin stars.,1
4,"Nobu, well known to be the best Japanese frestaurant in London and rated the 17th best restaurant in the world. We went there for my friend's birthday last month. Booking is essential in this restaurant on any day as it gets really busy with bankers, celebrities, businessmen, etc. We ordered Nobu signature's dishes (Black Cod with Miso, Braised Pork Belly with Miso, Ginger Salsa, Snowcrab with creamy spicy sauce) and Green Tea-ramisu, and Chocolate Bento as dessert. The food is excellent, and the bill came to £200 (wine, service charge inclusive). A bit pricey but it's definitely worth a try.",1
5,"The Service was really good . The staff were really friendly and helpful. Very attentive and quick. They presented the menu really well .
 The Food was excellent . Really tasty and each course was served in the right quantity. The presentention was unique and made the difference. The price i thought was reasonable and i really enjoyed every minute of my dinner I will definitely go back soon.",1
4,sushi is yummy! cocktails are delish!!!!! fab place to go with mates!,1
5,Was leaving a review for somethng lse ant though I should put my 5 cents in. Still one of my favorites along with Hakkasan but Some excellent food with a cool crowd. Only downside is the resident Papparazzi outside ignoring me as I come and go with friends.,1
5,Amazing and varied Japanese cuisine in a modern decor.,1
5,I have fond memories of sitting at the sushi bar here.  The sushi was fresh as can be and the otoro just melted in my mouth.  The sushi chefs were mesmerizing.  I was expecting more of a scene but was pleasantly surprised by the casual nature of this locale (even a few families with small children in the mix - aren't those kids lucky!).  I look forward to returning on my next trip to London.,1
5,"overall, the place itself is nice. the food is delicious but pricey, the decor is nice",1
5,"Went for lunch nach with a colleague. 
Staff is probably Japanese. 
They have a live stream of a camera on their website which makes it easy to check how busy they are. We went on a Thursday and is was rather quiet. 
Food was good. The portions are pretty good and you get extra free rice with some dishes if you are still hungry but is is not necessary. 
I would go again.",1
4,"If you are a fan of noodles, this is a prime spot. We had the Udon (tofu) and Soba (chicken), and now I'm hooked. This visit was really worth the cost: We had sashimi, beer and noodles - total cost 38£! Also the green tea is really nice and refreshing. Service was very quick and polite as well.
The place looks a bit rough, but don't be dissuaded. The food is yummy.",1
3,"I've had better, but if I lived in London, I'd be a regular.
What I liked about Tokyo Diner was the interior design of the restaurant. When inside the restaurant, I really felt like I was in Japan. I didn't get to see the second floor, but the first floor is very cramped. I had to wait outside the restaurant for about 20 minutes.
I got the gyu don, and it wasn't too special. I am huge tofu fan and I enjoyed the age-dashi tofu.

1,"Dined here with my family last night .... positive reviews on Yelp. We were tired after a long day of touring. This spot had such positive reviews on Yelp and it fell SO FAR SHORT of our expectations. Pros were quick service & good green tea. Cons were the food ... ordered the Chicken Katsu Bento ... fried, breaded chicken cutlet - dried out, no flavour. My sons had the Chicken Teriyaki... soaked in sauce. Husband had the Salmon Bento - better. Seafood salad was forlorn & limp. Chicken was dry and without flavour. Cold, cooked veggies accompanied the meal and had an odd taste to them. Beyond disappointing.... DON'T GO. A disappointing & a disastrous food experience.",-1
5,"I'm shocked I've never written a review for this place before, but seriously my favorite Japanese restaurant in London! It's one of my priorities to eat here at least once during my stay, and been here more than I can count even before it became so popular. Definitely happy for their success!
Typically I always order the salmon don, but I've tried the salmon bento box as well and thoroughly enjoyed both. I had ordered the crispy tofu, which was so fresh and silky! Amazing!!!!
The restaurant offers authentic Japanese cuisine as well as the tradition of not accepting tips, which is pretty cool. Feels like I've been transported straight to Japan!
My favorite restaurant!!! Try it!!",1
5,"An amazing and real Japanese restaurant! I really feel like I was back in Japan
The restaurant itself is really small but feel comfy and welcoming, especially on a cold day. The atmosphere and the decoration really reminded me the kind of restaurant I've been on a weelky based when I was living in Japan.
The service is nice, quick and they're paying attention when you need more water or warm tea.
The food itself was delicious and as good as in Japan! I ordered the chicken katsu don: it was big and fullfill and warm, exactly what I was expecting !
I totally recommend this place for people looking for real japanese food and for Japan's restaurant atmosphere. Of course it's much more expensive than the same in Japan but, the price worth the quality and these real japanese culinary experience.",1
5,Real Japanese home food! Feels nice and cozy and would love to come again to try other menu!,1
4,"This place has become a reliable choice for me - not somewhere I'd travel into town for specifically but perfect for a reasonably priced meal in central (usually pre/post cinema nearby!).
My mister loves it, I think because you can order an extra large 'omari' portion of rice for free if you're feeling hungry (which he always is). I think we both also appreciate its simplicity, with basic wooden furnishings and straight-to-the-point staff, which I guess lends it authenticity. There's also something endearing about its no-tips policy which I'm told is the norm in Japan.
It's a menu of no-frills Japanese dishes and I usually go for one of the donburi bowls which I find quite filling (and the boy usually finishes mine too). He's quite fond of the chicken katsu curry too, and we usually pair it with mugs of hot green tea. The food is nothing particularly creative then but executed well.
It's not the cheapest at c£9-10 a main but very reasonable for the area, and with the added perks of speedy service and a haven from the crowds (esp if you sit in the quiet basement area). Recommended if you're craving an asian food hit in the area - I know we'll be back!",1
4,"There was a wait early on a Weds night. This had to be a good sign of greater things to come. After our twenty minute wait, we got seated in the downstairs dining room. We ordered Katsu don and the spinach with sesame seeds. I have to say that this was the best katsu don that I have had in a long time. And it was wonderful to be served Japanese tea and for it to be refilled constantly throughout the meal. This meal was thoroughly enjoyable!",1
5,"Fantastic place, tried a bit of everything. Drinks wise: the plum wine's delicious, but very strong and sweet and the Asahi beer is fantastic, but it's a bit dry, so take that into account.
As for the actual food: we had a Bento box, which was larger than it seemed from the pictures, the salmon which has absolutely delicious, the rice tofu which also served as a great starter and a salmon sushi set with two nigiri which hit the spot. 
The waiter was terrific, very nice and prompt with fast service. I can confirm that you get free green tea with refills and snacks, and absolutely no tips. Great Japanese vibe to the place as well, feels like a corner of the country right there near Leicester Square. Absolutely delighted with the experience. We came out full and satisfied and what we paid was more than fair!",1
3,"I was skeptical about eating Japanese food in Chinatown, but I was pleasantly surprised. They have a pretty limited menu but do cover the basics. I ordered zaru udon and chicken karaage. The zaru udon was average. The chicken karaage looked really ugly but ended up being moist and tasty. 
It is higher than my standard of normal pricing for Japanese food, but for the area seems average. 
Seating is limited but there is a downstairs section if you're not picky about being able to see out a window.",-1
5,I love this place. Despite a fascination with Japan I've never been and this place really hits the spot. It's very affordable and has a minimalist atmosphere. The food is truly Japanese dinner food it's not fancy but it's very well made and tasty.,1
5,"Decent place to get Japanese food. They offer complimentary tea and snacks. They have a wide selection of Japanese food. Service was also great. They donate all ""tip"" to charity ehich is a very good cause.",1
4,"Stopped using Yelp for a while after returning to the States, but I saw this partially finished review and it brought me back to my experience of the place. 
Food: We had the Tofu Don Ju, Katsu Curry, Nigiri Set, and Wakame Green Salad. All of the food was pretty good, although I wouldn't say it was amazing. Definitely check the place out and try their food, but don't expect anything gourmet.
Service: This place has absolutely amazing service and I love their tipping policy. They were extremely fast with taking out order and were always available to help us out. Our tea was never empty because the waiter always refilled it for us when it got low. As for their tipping policy, the waiters don't actually accept tip. Rather, all tips go to a local homeless charity. To me, I think that's a really nice gesture for the restaurant to its community.",1
4,"You've likely walked past Tokyo Diner a dozen times and never thought twice about it. It's the fun looking Japanese restaurant in the middle of Chinatown, and to be fair, you've probably been walking to a Chinese restaurant when you have actually gone past it, so fair enough if you haven't been in. 
Stop! Go in. Eat. Enjoy. 
Tokyo Diner offers some truly authentic Japanese food, with great service and atmosphere. The dishes on offer are exactly like what I saw on offer while I was going through Japan, and it was great to see such traditional dishes like cold noodle dishes or the simple tofu side dish with spring onions and ginger.  
It's not exactly the cheapest restaurant, both in Chinatown or for Japanese food in London, but when you consider there's no tip asked for, green tea is included and the food is great tasting (plus you can order extra rice for free), there's not much you can really complain about!
4 stars overall for great service, great food, but not the best nor cheapest!",1
4,"I really like this place. It's cheap and cheerful. It kind of reminds me of being in Japan too.
It's reasonably priced given its location, with bento boxes ranging from £12-20. While the quality is not the best of the best, it delivers. The service and food is quick and efficient too.
I was also surprised by how tasty the sashimi was. There might be a wait though as this place is small. Oh and the Szechuan place next door, Baiwei is very, very good! I once did starters at Tokyo Diner and main courses at Baiwei.",1
5,"A consistent performer! This is a restaurant you will want to keep coming back to! 
The restaurant is set on the ground floor and basement and can get packed very quickly. But don't worry, you're likely to get a table from my experience.
The staff are always happy to serve and the food is prepared in good time. The food is always outstanding and I don't have a bad thing to say about the place - so what are you waiting for?",1
5,"Very good food, good portions, and great prices. 
We were promptly greeted by a friendly hostess, and our party (including children) were seated in a nice corner table. Shortly, free green tea, and crackers arrived while we reviewed the menu. 
Authentic Japanese items are abundant throughout the menu, however you can tell they are accustomed to different taste choices (or picky little kids). You can simply pay 70p to change from bone in chicken to boneless in some of their dishes for example. We were not rushed to finish our meal, only asked if we needed anything every little bit. They don't take tips, but you wouldn't know that given the attentiveness of the staff. 
We will be back!!",1
4,"Good Japanese restaurant in Chinatown. I had a craving for pork Katsu curry on a rainy day and looked on yelp for recommendations. This place received quite a lot of good reviews. The place is no frills and simple service. You can let the server know whether you want more or less rice. I asked for less rice because I don't really eat much rice. The Katsu curry came with a side salad which is nice because I have to consciously order a side of veggies or a side salad when I'm traveling and living out of my suitcase. Portion size was still big, taste was good, and price was affordable.",1
4,"I popped here before a yelp event for a quick bite to eat and was really surprised by this place! There weren't too many vegan main options, but most side dishes were suitable and not too pricey so you could get a few. I had the hiya yakko which is a chilled tofu cube. A great big chunk!! It was plain, but lovely and fresh and i ate the whole thing up. I also had the veggie maki, which was six pieces of sushi with cucumber and six with Japanese radish. Yummy and veryyyyy filling. The prices here are quite random. Veggie dishes are generally cheap, but meat ranges from reasonable to pretty pricey. One of the many benefits of eating vegan =p
This place is interesting as a business as they are focused on using sustainable produce and give lots of information about their principles on the menu, which I thought was really cool. Their website is also interesting as it has a live webcam of the restaurant, which they say they use to attract potential staff and chefs =] very different!",1
4,"Great Japanese food, nice staff and an okay environment.
We waited in line for about 10-15 minutes before being seated.
We ordered quite quickly, and got out food in pretty good time.
The food itself was really great, I wish I'd order more.
I got two side dishes (as I didn't think I was going to eat that much) and my partner got a main course.
We both had miso soup which was brilliantly made, and quite a big portion.
The prices were a bit high, but we were happy to pay due to the quality of the food.",1
3,"If you are exploring Chinatown, this place is hard to miss. Husband and I decided to share a bento as we wanted a light snack (but weren't starving). We ordered their teriyaki chicken bento and paid extra for substituting the thighs with chicken tits. 
The neat thing about ordering here is you can ask for a bigger portion of rice at no extra charge. We did that and even though the portions were good, everything was so bland. From the teriyaki chicken tits to the assorted marinated veggies - ehh. Really fresh sashimi though. Good presentation but probably will venture off to try another place for Japanese bento. 
Side note - if you bring in bubble tea from another place, you cannot consume it in the restaurant. 
Side note 2 - The black shaped large ceramic spoon in the center of the bento holding three green beans is not to be used as a spoon...oops.",-1
5,"I really like Tokyo Diner. It's by far the best affordable Japanese restaurant I have visited outside Japan. I will admit that having first tasted Japanese food in Japan, I'm truly spoiled and have always found it hard to find the same level of excellence elsewhere. The vibe of this place reminds me very much of Japan though and that adds to the experience.
I have been here on three occasions and would definitely return. I tried the bento box with salmon the first time and thought it was definitely worth the value. The next times I tried the sushi (simply delicious) and a good bowl of curried udon. The free tea that is served makes me incredibly happy and I'm happy that the restaurant is relatively small, even if that means you usually have to wait for a bit to get a seat.",1
5,"Really good fast food that will not break the bank.   wine £8.50 a bottle!     
I always feel like a pig when I come here as I always feel that I order half the menu but I end up eating it all as it is sooooo good.",1
5,Good Curry Katsu. Wish it was more spicy but overall amazing. Small cozy space. Free hot tea.,1
4,Cold broccoli was delicious.  Had the bento box.  Many things I have never tried at any Asian restaurant before.,1
5,"The service was friendly and quick, and we were enchanted by the food!
The zaru soba was fresh and tasty. The nigiri, however, really took the cake. Every piece had wasabi lovingly nestled between the sashimi and the rice, which made for a savory and authentic taste. Unlike some other Japanese restaurants in the area, the portion of rice was not overwhelming compared to the size of the sashimi, resulting in a far more balanced flavour.
Another pleasant surprise was their eco-consciousness. All their fish is environmentally sourced, as is their electricity!
Tip: they don't take tips. Which is why we're writing this review, because the least we could do is spread the word about their amazing food and warm service!",1
4,"Excellent sushi! I got the nigiri set (some sushi, some nigiri) and the miso soup. Soup was quite good, not too salty, but no tofu in it. The sushi+nigiri were excellent! Rice was a bit sweet and delicious, and the fish was quality.
Ambience was relaxed; not loud, not quiet. Easy to hear anyone you're there with. The venue is quite small, I wouldn't go there with a group of more than 4, but 1-4 is appropriate. Service was solid; they're friendly and attentive, and our food did not take long to arrive. Bit odd that the soup came at the same time as the nigiri set.",1
4,"I've been coming for over 10 years, amongst the dross in Chinatown this is a really solid restaurant that ticks all the boxes. 
It's clean, fast, friendly and everything there from the donburi, to noodles to the sushi are all solid.  It's classic Japanese food done well and it's nice to see it still going strong.  It's not haute cuisine you go for here but comforting meals you know and love.",1
4,"Good meal for the price.  Located in Soho and very busy area in the evening.  I got the chicken katsu curry.
Recommend this place for a cheap meal.  Cash only.",1
4,A good spot in Chinatown to grab some quick sushi or a bowl of rice and protein. Nothing special but the staff is nice. It's biggest pro is that it is open late and not the typical dark pub. Serving staff is very friendly.,1
3,"The food here is great and very authentic Japanese cuisine. So far, we tried the katsu curry with rice and the nigiri set. Both are extremely delicious. One great thing here is that you can get a bonus on rice if you ask for them with any donburi or curry rice. 
But there is something less to be desired about the owners' attitude toward their customers. I tried to be friendly and speak Japanese with them, but they were extremely protective and replied in English sternly. Service level could be improved to make this store a better experience to be honest. But at least people will not be disappointed with the food! This place can also get quite crowded during weekends due to being a relatively small place.",-1
5,"Found this place via Yelp. I love the tofu appetizer and spicy fried chicken better than katsu chicken over rice. Gosh, I was simply amazed by the tenderness of the tofu",1
5,"Amazing place and great food! You should definetly go there if you want real Japanese food. 
I had the Gyu Don and my mom the vegetable curry... both were incredibly good! 
When you arrive they give you tea, I also ordered the Miso soup that was lovely!
Highly recommended!",1
4,"I was a bit skeptical as Tokyo Diner is right in the middle of Chinatown and the name sounded a bit odd as well. The ambiance is simple and clean with attentive staff. Prices are very reasonable and they do not charge service nor do they ask for tips.
We tried the sashimi, kastu curry, and chicken karaage. The chicken had a great crust and was super juicy. You have the option of white or dark meat for the chicken karaage which I do not see often. The fish was fresh and nicely sliced.",1
5,"Tokyo Diner is a gem. For starters, the food is delicious--this seems like a good place to start. I've been here twice and have tried the udon noodles and their salmon teriyaki set lunch. The shop itself is small and cosy. The staff is courteous but no-nonsense. Table turnaround happens quickly here and they are unapologetic for it. That being said, the staff is extremely accommodating to diners and offers a great deal of information about their food and the customs associated with a Japanese meal (no tipping, free tea, free extra portions of rice) on their menu. 
Another thing I love about this place is their extensive lunch menu (so cheap) and the further discounts they offer--if you rock up between 3-6pm (their least busy hours) they offer a £1 discount off of their already affordable fare. 
When planning a meal in Chinatown it can be difficult to be decisive--as delicious food surrounds you from all angles--but the next time you're faced with a moment of indecision, I urge you to check this place out.",1
3,"Very good katsu curry, but nothing exceptional. If you enjoy having the traditional Japanese katsu curry, this is your place! I also read on the menu that you can get an extra-large portion of rice at no additional cost. 
I really enjoyed my food. It has been a while that I just had a katsu curry without anything fancy or the chef hyping it up. Good tasting and fresh :) It reminds me of what a katsu curry originally taste like.
The place is nicely decorated to look traditionally Japanese, so very simple. They do try to maximize the space as much as possible, so I felt like I was having lunch with the people sitting at the next table. Perhaps this is part of the appeal. 
If I am hungry in Chinatown and unsure of where to go for a sure-thing good tasting meal, I would certainly return. However, I would not travel just to eat here.",-1
4,"Katsudon! That's what you should get here :). They make a mean katsudon and it's very good values (large portions). You get hot tea and rice crackers while you wait for your food. It gets a little crowded in there, but I've never had to wait too long to get seated.",1
1,"Yuck. Ordered 4 rolls. None of them tasty. Fish wasn't particularly flavorful, too much sauce on top of rolls that had it, and 3 of the 4 were mostly rice. No refills on the green tea, and no sight of these rice cakes everyone is talking about. No low-sodium soy sauce. No WiFi. Edamame was fresh, crisp, yummy. Miso soup was also good. We ordered an extra edamame, ate the centers of our rolls and left hungry. Boo",-1
5,"I love myself a bit of Tokyo Diner.
Having not been here for about a decade, I needed a good post-cinema meal, and a lightbulb went off in my head reminding me that I hadnt been here in 10 years.
Note: my stomach has just started rumbling thinking of what I had here :)
Small,  but perfectly formed, Tokyo Diner is kinda on the outside of Chinatown, but it reminded me of Asia: relatively understated in decor with all attention going to the food, with service very quick and no nonsense. The staff were very friendly, and I like how, if you're especially famished, you can ask for an Omari portion which is larger but free serving of rice. Mmmm.
As it stands, I was particularly hungry and got myself Omari with a Katsu which was dreamy. Tokyo Diner's authentic no-tips policy took me back to the land of the rising sun, and I shall be defo coming back here, as soon as I can.
The maps of Japan have also had a knock-on effect of making me wanting to travel again, so at least I have something else to daydream about for a few days :)
Price wise, £10 for a meal which isn't bad for the centre of town.",1
5,"A girl took me here on a date once. It was great. We had sushi and we also had a big tofu thing that looked disgusting but was delicious. 
Things didn't work out but I kept returning to the Tokyo diner. On dates. And the girls are always impressed by me. ""Wow, what a find."" 
When I say impressed by me, I mean by the sushi. They soon forget about me. 
And pretty soon I'm going to take some girl there and I'll bump into the other girls there and it'll all get a little awkward. Especially if the first girl is there, because she'll know that it wasn't my little find, it was hers. 
Anyway. The sushi's good. If you're pretty and like sushi, maybe I'll take you there sometime.",1
4,"I'm a great, great, great fan of Ramen or any other noodle soup. I always wanted to go to this authentic Japanese diner, but it was normally too full to even step into it. Meeting up with some friends on a schedule that included a pub quiz later on in Walthamstow, we were early enough to get seats. 
The service is nice. The chairs are incredible uncomfortable. The menu is great. The food is great. the space is so small that whenever someone opens the door the draft will hit you wherever you chose to sit. The food is worth it!!",1
4,"We where strolling around Leicester Square really hungry but didn't want any of that fast food stuff... there in a corner we found this nifty little place just waiting for us. 
Place is small but nicely kept, menu has several choices to choose from and we pretty much liked everything, but mostly: Salmon Tataky, sushi plater, sashimi and the chicken karate. Everything was fresh and quickly served and for london, I don´t believe it was that expensive for what we got.",1
4,"From the exterior, Tokyo Diner looks simple and isn't eye-catching. However, the inside is beautiful, clean and as if you walked into Japan. 
The menu is descriptive, explaining what goes well with what and on the front of the menu is a little description explaining they don't accept tips. I felt this was helpful to avoid embarrassment or avoid any insulting behaviour. 
I ordered the Nigiri set which was plenty for lunch along with edamame and miso soup. The fish was very fresh and presented wonderfully. There was just something about the restaurant I really admired. It was quiet, many diners ate on their own and they were comfortable doing so. 
The price was extremely affordable, the restaurant very clean and the service I found helpful.",1
5,"Beautiful Japanese food, lovely service, given the location, I thought it would be one of those ""fake Japanese restaurant"" - secretly own by non-Japanese Asian. However, I was pleasantly surprise that this is not the case - if it was, they hide it very well.  Lol
I particularly enjoy the curry, and for those who are VERY hungry, you can even ask for extra rice too!
Highly recommend!",1
4,"Eating here honestly just made me miss home more, I guess. I'm not Japanese, but growing up in Taiwan there was no shortage of good, cheap Japanese food, and I guess this place is the closest to that standard I could find in my short stay in London, with somewhat reasonable prices.
Their katsu curry is my favorite. Crispy fried pork chops in hearty curry - what more can I ask for, really. As for appetizers, I often get the chicken karaage - it's just simple, no-frills Japanese fried chicken. Yum. The free tea and rice crackers give it an even more authentic feel, and the staff was always nice to me.
Unfortunately they do not do takeout (apart from sushi, if I remember correctly) - hopefully that might change? At any rate, a nice place for ordinary Japanese fare, nothing fancy.",1
4,"My mum lives far enough out in the sticks to not have a good sushi place close by, so as soon as she gets into urban areas, she has one craving: SUSHI.
So after a long morning of shopping in Covent Garden, I unleashed my Yelp App to pick the best place for sushi - and Tokyo Diner popped up. I've been past the place a few times and never considered it since I thought it looked a bit ""gimmick-y"", but if the Yelpers say it's good...
... And as usual, Yelp did not dissapoint. It was really good!
The prices are what you would usually expect. And even though the place is a bit ""cliche"", it does feel very authentic.
The food was nothing super special, it was plain, simple tasty Japanese food, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would also recommend it for if you have some similar cravings when in China Town :)
(Man, I totally have cravings from writing this article already!)",1
4,"3 stars for food + 1 star for value/service. 
I had a chicken katsu curry and it was pretty bland even after dumping shichimi on it, so it would have been nice to have spiciness levels for the curry. Fukujinzuke would also have been nice.  Additionally some shochu options would be cool.",1
3,"If you are looking for Sushi, almost any other Sushi place will be better. Little selection.",-1
3,"I'd really give this place a 3.5 stars if I could.
I've passed by this place so many times and finally stopped here for lunch the other day.  They have a pretty good variety of items on the menu - and I went with the katsu curry.  I thought it was good but it didn't get me excited enough to give it 4*s.  The age dashi tofu is really good.  I'll have to go back and try some of the other things on the menu.",-1
2,"Pretty unimpressed.  This place is right near my office, and my wife and I always notice the line outside, so we decided to check it out one Friday evening.  I'd call everything ""okay"" and give it 3 stars if it weren't for the tuna.  
I generally avoid ordering tuna these days due to the general overfishing problem with bluefin, but my wife loves it, so we usually wind up with at least a couple pieces.  The ones from Tokyo Diner were outright bad. Greyish (should have been our first clue), tough, and distinctly fishy-tasting.  If I were running the place, I would have let people know that there was no tuna we were willing to serve that night rather than dishing out that mess.  I would have respected that decision much more.
It's also crowded, fairly noisy, and the service was so-so.  Not my scene.",-1
3,"Summary:
+ A Japanese canteen, that's exactly what this place is 
Overall: 
This place is a Japanese canteen. A canteen in Japan. Canteen japonaise. 
I don't know what else I can add. 
The food is definitely authentic. Their food is kind of comfort food that would be served in a canteen. (For the third time. I won't say that again.) Their food is decent but not special. To use proper foodie terminologies, they are ""hmm yummy"" but not quite ""OMFG! You gotta try this sXXX. This is f-ing AWESOME!"". 
 
The restaurant is very small and it's right at the heart of China Town so it gets packed. 
I have never been impressed by their staff, though. Most of the time they are rather blunt. I thought all Japanese people were nice and polite. 
In one of my recent visits, I overheard two waitresses chatting quite loudly at the back (in Japanese) for quite a long time. Maybe it wasn't the busiest time of all but it doesn't feel right. 
But they can get away with it. They are at a prime location with high visibility. The food is decent. So there is enough influx of tourists (they are one-off transactions) and locals who need a quick and filling meal. 
I will still go back for the high cost performance. I only care about food.",-1
3,"Husband and I ate there tonight based on the number of great reviews, however I have to say this place was pretty average and a bit over priced for the food you receive. The menu isn't very large and it's crazy that the bento boxes were about £16-19! I ended up eating some teriyaki chicken ( only comes with about 4 small to mid size pieces) and is £7.20. The chicken itself was pretty tasty but not amazing. I would have priced it at £4.50. Also since this doesn't come with rice I had to order it separate. The miso soup was a bit bland, I've had better. My husband had the katsu curry and said that both the curry and the katsu were very bland. The included salad was not the best. We've eaten at many Japanese restaurants that were better and cheaper than this one.",-1
5,"I used to come here all the time with my friends when I studied abroad in London. The chicken karaage bento is wonderful, especially washed down with some plum wine. I'm not a huge fan of katsudon, but I had a friend who loves it, and the Diner's was some of the best we had. Everything seems very fresh and tasty and basic, but in a good way. Japanese home cooking, I suppose!
 Waits can get long in the evening, but they seem to move everyone in and out very fast. The waitresses are very nice--but no tipping! Despite the plethora of restaurants in Chinatown it's sort of a culinary wasteland, and Tokyo Diner is a respite and a delight.",1
4,"A simple no fuss Japanese restaurant.  There is nothing  I could fault about the food in this place. I couldn't give it 5 stars because it was just simple Japanese comfort food, nothing out of ex-ordinary and all the usual Japanese dishes I could get in any other Japanese restaurant. Tokyo Diner focuses really mainly on one plate dishes like donburi and also their famous big portion bento boxes. There are also sushi platters but it just does not have a large a la carte menu. It's a place for a quick fulfilling dinner if you don't fancy Chinese in China town. 
I do love it's concept of 'No Tipping'. With its free tea, Japanese crackers and no service charge it felt like a Japanese Wong Kei's with better service and better food. Portions were just as big though with free refills of rice for those extra hungry ones. Awesome.
We started with starters of agedashi tofu, spinach goma, miso soup and pickles. The tofu was average, not the most silky I've had but still very satisfying in a very well made dashi sauce. Spinach goma stood out the most although I wish they let it warm up a bit rather than it come out straight out the fridge, Still I love the nutty sesame sauce that made this dish so moorish. It tasted just like peanut butter but sweetened and gave the dish a slight sticky texture. It no longer felt healthy but indulgent instead. Wasn't a fan of the plum pickle that was too sour but the rest was fine.
My main of pork katsu was massive with a lovely marinated leaf salad on the side. It was one of the better ones I've had with next chunky soft carrots and potatoes in the curry which was perfectly seasoned and flavoured, not too sweet or salty. The katsu was perfectly fried, a nice crunchy batter into a thick succulent tender piece of pork. Rice was fluffy and cooked perfectly. A good choice.
However weirdly enough I preferred my boyfriend's tamago don. Something so simple like on egg on rice was so good and comforting. Where my katsu curry cooled down very quickly my boyfriend's dish remained hot throughout due to the egg acting like a blanket. It was soft, mouthmetling and cooked in a dashi stock that wrapped it in a nice savoury flavour. Together with the al dente sticky rice it was just the perfect combination. 
We also shared a zaru soba which was faultless again. A nice portion, noodles cooked as they should and sauce flavoured well. 
The most disappointed part was our cold sake which tasted like they had watered it down. Still it did not effect our overall opinion of the place as we were very satisfied with meal. 
I do love this place and will probably return very soon. The automatic push button door was a nice touch as it made my boyfriend feel nostalgic about his holiday memories in Japan as apparently those doors were common over there. Also that and the light wooden tables, Japanese staff, a large map of Japan and the rest of the decor. With that in mind and the cheap generous prices do prepare to queue or get there a bit early.",1
3,"I don't usually eat japanese food in chinatown, for reasons quite obviously stated in the first half of this sentence. I heard this place was pretty reasonably priced so we popped into here because I couldn't touch the dim sum places until after this stupid chinese notion of not eating prawns after surgery. And in chinatown - every dumpling you eat is like a lucky dip- you don't know what meats they have. 
I would usually head for proper ramen in either bone daddies or tenten but due to not being able to walk very far 4 days after surgery, and i NEEDED to get a haircut because damn, i need to feel pampered after having such a shit time with my medical problems, I decided to treat my cousin here. (he chaperoned me so I didn't get bashed about in london, our family is close knit like that!)
It's basic- you get some set lunches, where you would get pickles, rice, what you ordered and soup and I love thats how simple it is, it's the epitome of japanese clean eating so you don't feel so msg-fied afterwards. I enjoyed my lunch!
Reasonably priced? for the simplicity- I don't really want to pay over £20 and we weren't that full, so no, I think that I can definitely find better japanese deals elsewhere.",-1
4,"As close to a traditional Japanese experience you can get without hopping on a plane.   Tokyo Diner has barely changed in the years it's been part of China Town, but this really is down to the fact what they are doing, they're doing very well.   The bento boxes here are probably the best value for money - though saying that, it's hardly pricey to eat here - there's a good selection of traditional Japanese food including a small sushi menu. The jasmine tea and little crackers are free, which is always a nice touch and there's absolutely no tipping aloud! This is considered rude in Japan and the same applies here, so keep your change to yourself and just enjoy the cute corner of our very in Japan in London.",1
3,"Distinctly OK.
Overcooked fried tofu & katsu in general; it's a bit cheaper but about par for hte course in C-town.",-1
4,"I chose this place for a first dinner date, having read the previous reviews on here and got a verbal confirmation from a friend that it was good. 
We stepped through the nifty sliding door, and we greeted and sat almost immediately, menus in hand. We ordered sushi and edamame, and while we waited we had the free green tea (which was rather good and not horribly stewed).
Menu wise it was very well labelled, I liked that they were clear on ingredients and common allergens. They also admitted there may be a language barrier with the server so in case of special requests to make sure the server understood.
The food came quickly and it was clearly very fresh- the rice was perfect and the fish was flavoursome and of a decent thickness. I could have done with more ginger but I'm sure they would have provided if I'd asked.
Despite it being reasonably busy they didn't rush us off our table after we finished the food but continued chatting, even pouring more tea for us.
Polite, efficient, good value. I will be going back!",1
5,This is one of the few places were you can taste authentic Japanese cuisine. Be sure to treat yourself to crunchy Tsukemono pickles or udon noodles. Of course free green tea only helps to cherish your meal.,1
4,We were pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. It is really clean and it had really good service. For me the fact that I could get a Bento box with sashimi was a perfect combination.,1
4,"Last Saturday we went to Tokyo Diner. It was a great choice. We were also very lucky because we got seated right away, but immediately after us (around 7.30) people started to line up.
Tokyo Diner is all about one thing: great standard Japanese food. The setting of the restaurant is very basic and small (don't dress up for this). All staff is Japanese and very friendly & humble. They refuse any tips because ""it's not part of the Japanese culture"" (their words). They don't sell Tuna because they believe in only serving sustainable food. As much as I love tuna, I can only truly admire this choice and position they take.
The food was really good. We didn't eat as much as we normally do at a Japanese place but had a fair amount of salmon sushi (really fresh), pork with curry (tasted like other ones I had before) and Udon noodles (almost the most recommendable dish of the menu! Only £8 for the noodles with chicken and better than any other trendy Udon place I've been to in Soho).
Overall, all the prices are VERY reasonable (almost cheap) for such quality! It's about £2-3 for a beer for example. And the total bill (and in the end, we were full) was only £50 for several beers, glasses of wine, fresh sushi, pork, udon ... 
I definitely go back when I'm around in Chinatown!",1
4,"Nothing fancy, but the food is good and the staff friendly.  The price is good and the overall quality satisfactory.",1
5,"A great bet for a pleasant, non-greasy meal at a very convenient location. 
Remarkably tranquil inside, for such a busy area. As soon as you walk in, you're seated and served rice crackers and green tea by the attentive staff. The menu is not as expansive as other places, but everything they serve is reliable and less greasy. My comfort foods are the soba noodles and aubergine or tofu with dashi. Besides the food and service, it feels good to support a small business that has a strong ethos. One of my go-tos.",1
3,"Seems that whenever I am in Chinatown, I pass by this place. Since I often go to Chinatown to get my Chinese fix, I have been ignoring this place until today. This is a very down to earth diner. The food is well prepared and delicious. You can get Bento, noodles, sushi, and your standard Japanese starter dishes here. My friend and I ordered a sashimi plate and Agedashi tofu to start. At first we thought 10 pound for a plate of sashimi wasn't a bad price, but when we saw the 7 small pieces of sashimi, we realized it wasn't the deal of the century. The Agedashi tofu was really good. I had the Katzu don which I liked. It was different from the Katzu I am used to, in this version, Katzu was cooked first and then cooked with eggs to form a pancake that covered the rice in the bowl. It was very yummy and very filling as well. 
What I like about this restaurant is the attention to details. You will find the most comprehensive menu here with information about gluten and nuts/seeds content for each and every one of their dishes. They also clearly stated on their menu that they don't accept tips! Overall, a good place for a quick meal.",-1
5,"Very busy restaurant near the Prince Charles cinema the food was very good and of high quality we had the sashimi set, and a Couple of bento boxes. Service was excellent and attentive. Highly recommended.",1
3,"I would like to give this place a 4 star, but it just lacked a little something to push it into that category.
I love Japanese food, and it's quite possibly my favorite cuisine out there. I can't tell why I wasn't too impressed by this place but here are my general thoughts on my dining experience here:
1. I thought the prices were just a tad higher than for what they were offering. 
2. I was hoping they would have more options on the menu. I know this is probably a silly thing to say considering how extensive their menu already is, but I was really expecting an izakaya style place and this was not it at all! And if it is, it is a very limited menu for an izakaya.
3. The food was just filling enough.
4. Despite the Japanese speaking servers, I still felt this place didnt feel Japanese enough, it feels like I'm in Chinatown...probably because it is in Chinatown =P
In the end, maybe my expectations were just too high before I came, or I just have my own idea of what good/inexpensive japanese dining should be like.  It's a good fill your stomach on a decent variety of food, but nothing about it deserves special attention.",-1
3,Absolutely one of the best Japanese homemade food in London. I tried several other places this week because I really miss authentic Japanese food. Unfortunately many of them are not good enough. Food here is more fresh and authentic. Love their side dishes so I order bento very time. Worthy. Service is good today. One girl was very nice. But the cashier lady was distracted. Of course they should operate a no tip policy because there was no service at all( unless you consider ordering food is a service)Btw last month I also had a really bad experience with the old lady in the cashier desk. So arrogant. Never met such an Japanese in Japan. But well I love the food here so until I find some better options I still will come,-1
3,"I never thought I'd judge a restaurant by its entrance door, but I did.  Sign of a quality time ahead, I say.
I've passed by the restaurant dozens of times but never stepped inside.  It's deceptive on first impression as the space appears to be small, but the sign at the door that says ""seating for 100 people"" sums it up pretty well.  We were taken to the seating downstairs, where we were joined fellow diners in a windowless basement.  We promptly ordered the £8 Oyaka don (chicken pieces with scrambled egg and brothy rice), and a fried chicken bento box which was a bit of a letdown for £16 (you get several pieces of fried chicken, 3 pieces of salmon sashimi, some veggies).  I'd recommend the rice bowls.
Overall, it's decent.  I'm a bit obsessed with Japanese food so I'm glad I found it.",-1
4,"Considering it's somewhat of an institution, I'm a little ashamed to say that I'd not heard of Tokyo Diner until about 2 months ago, despite having walked past in probably hundreds of times in my life.  Anyway, now that I've been it renders my introduction totally pointless but hey, I had to write something there.
TD prides itself on being open 365 days a year from 12 until 12 - they're basically the guardian angel of Japanese food.  As of the time of review (Jan 2015), they haven't been opening on Mondays due to staff shortage - whether this is a temporary or more permanent measure I'm not sure, but I'll update the tips as and when.  A couple of other things:
- they don't accept tips (as it is not a Japanese custom) giving any mistaken tips to the homeless
- they don't serve tuna (eco decision)
- there's a full list of allergens in their food on the back pages.
There's nothing outlandish about the menu - it's pretty much on par with similar places such as Eat Tokyo - soba, curries, donburi, and a smallish selection of sushi/sashimi - simple and good.
When I went, I tried the oyakodon (a hearty combination of infanticide and matricide - it's a delicious chicken omelette cooked in dashi stock), wakame seaweed salad, and chicken karaage.  The salad was fine, although not as tasty as I expected (could've done with more dressing.  Japanese dressing is the beeeest) and the kara-age was decent, if not the best; that said, the flavour was good as they've got the marinade right.  The oyakodon was solid - not overcooked and with a strong dashi flavour.  Prices are reasonable - £8.50 for the oyakodon, curry dishes are around £10.50 - whilst not cheap cheap, the place is good value given the quality of the food.  As it's well known to everyone apart from me, it gets fairly busy, but it has quite a bit of downstairs seating; service isn't super friendly but it was reasonably efficient when I went, so all's good.  Overall, I'm glad I finally got round to trying here and definitely recommended for a good, simple dinner.",1
4,"I've been here a few times and it seems like they have a lot more space than they used to (both upstairs and downstairs).  I imagine it would still fill up on a busy night but it was a Monday so we didn't have to wait.  I had sushi with a side of more sushi, miso and edamame.  Overall the sushi wasn't amazing but it was still very good and definitely for the price.
It's definitely one of my favourite places to go around Leichester Square.",1
3,"I was there yesterday for lunch. Nice place, authentic Japanese food in London's Chinatown.
I had a great sauce chicken katsu don - YUMMY ! The resto has a strong Udon menu but perhaps lacking in the sashimi department. 
I also appreciate its sustainable development policy re not serving tuna. 
Would definitely return.",-1
4,"The Tokyo Diner doesn't serve Tuna due to ecological concerns. They donate all their tips to charity, and they give you more rice if you ask for it.
The people in the Tokyo Diner are nice people.
It also helps that their food is also pretty good. It's not going to change the world, but it's well-prepared, honestly priced and arrives as soon as it's ready. This can cause some social complications if someone in a group orders a quickly prepared dish (something like the aubergine - something I strongly recommend - which is served cold), though. The lunch deals are all very good value and come with a selection of pickles, miso soup and a side dish that varies day to day. Everyone also gets free tea (and refills!) and some rice crackers to munch while they wait.
The only slight downside is that there's no tempura on the menu, which struck me a bit strange for a place focused on bento-style meals, but it's not exactly the end of the world.  On balance, it's one of the better 'authentic' Japanese places around here.",1
4,"Not like the other places I usually eat Sushi at, but i decided to give it a try! Fresh, light, and many interesting choices.
I would return back with my wife for sure! she would love it.",1
5,"In bubbling Soho and Chinatown it's difficult to make a choice for a restaurant. They all look similars and you wonder if the quality is everywhere good not to be disapointed and unfortunately it's not ! 
That's why I definitely recommand to go to this address. It has good prices, ethical concept (they don't use tuna because it's a specie in danger even it's cultural for Japanese to normally eat it) they don't take tip and ask instead to come back and bring friend ! Love the concept :-)
Inside the decoration is classic, wood table and some Japanese flag as decoration. You have lunch menu or a la carte suggestion. You can go for hot meal such as soup or fried meat or fish but also some sushi and cold sashimi. 
I've been a couple of time and never been disapointed. The service is efficient, polite and friendly even quite shy as it's common in asian culture. Might be busy but worth make a try and even try a bit if the queue is not too long. If this one is full, then walk around and catch one with as much as stickers as possible from all the guides and travels books that have rated the place, the best way to find something else !",1
2,"There's nothing really much to say about this place. Everything was pretty mediocre. The atmosphere, the service, and the food were all very average. Me and my friend were close to running out the door after having been served our drinks, but our morale enforced us to stay put!
The only thing bringing my star rating up a notch is my passion for Japanese food, and well.. I suppose I did get to eat that (as unsatisfying as it was). Plus, I needn't pay for tip, which saved me change for a post pick-me-up.",-1
4,"I loved this restaurant. Really funky with excellent food at good prices (service is included). Crowded, but space available.",1
3,"I found this place on Yelp after craving sushi late night after a long day working and not wanting room service.
I opted for the sashimi set at 11:40pm. They close exactly at 12:00am and no yelp, they do not offer take away... 
Sushi was typical but not exceptional. As the other reviews say, the place is run by Japanese and is a good place to stop by but not anything special.",-1
4,"Tokyo Diner was one of the first Japanese restaurants to open in the Chinatown area. I remember peering at the menu at the time, wondering about this new cuisine invading the homogeneous Anglo-Canto food in the rest of Chinatown.
At those prices, it was definitely worth a punt and I haven't looked back since. I usually go for a bento box as I get some sushi (essential for me) as well as another dish included. It's a complete meal in itself.
It's not swanky and a little cozy but a reliable cheap Japanese meal.",1
2,"Usually have a great meal at Tokyo Diner. Good Hoso Maki and spinach as usual. Problem was the Soba noodle soup and edame beans were drenched in salt/ soya sauce, the kind that gives you headaches after. I fear they might be adding salt based additives to the food now so will unlikely be returning!",-1
4,Really good value and great quality. We were quickly seated and served with complimentary tea. Our food was served quickly and came with miso soup at no extra cost. Couldn't ask for more given how much every other restaurant in that area overcharges.,1
4,"Service is ok but the sushi is fantastic. The salmon is as fresh as it gets. Try the salmon nigiris, Salmon set, miso soup, and salmon tataki. The place is very casual and in the middle of chinatown, the place has a very laid back feel with traditional japanese vibe.",1
4,"I've been here several times with friends and I'm endlessly amazed by the friendliness of the service, value of their menu and fabulous taste of the food. For Japanese food that's more authentic than the usual London offerings, but still affordable, you really can't beat it. I would recommend the pork katsu bento box, which comes with candied sweet potato and other delights.",1
3,"This place is a good place to stop into after a show.  There isn't anything especially good but it seems like mostly a traditional Japanese sort of place and I appreciate there consideration of the environment in terms of over-fishing of tuna.
The service is slow at times which is unusual since the place is so small.",-1
4,"Totally Japanese~ some people may not get used to it, but I love it! It's smooth and soft~ noodles are terrific! However,  sushi is a little bit loose, so it is easy to fall apart. Anyway, good place to try Japanese food! Definitely try it out!",1
1,There is a reason you dont tip. Worst service in chinatown and that's pretty bad. Cheap meal does not make up for the rudeness from the polish and japanese staff. Avoid this place it has gone downhill.,-1
5,"Very nice place for an authentic sushi dinner. Was there in line with a vacation in London. I already made the place out via the internet from Germany and specifically went there one evening.
Nice area for nightlife around it.
Two stories, ground floor and cellar. I got a table in the cellar, where it was a bit crowded but the atmosphere was nice. While I waited for my order I was served a pot of jasmine tea and some japanese crisps. Nice gesture.
Sushi was quite tasty and the price was alright.
The restaurant made the decision, that they do not serve tuna due to the catching conditions. They state that nice sushi is also possible without tuna. They shall be assuered. Respect for that. Next time in London, next time at Tokyo Diner!",1
4,"These guys are saints. Quite amazing that they manage to keep up standards and politeness in the heart of the west end. Reminds me a little of a single trip to Tokyo a decade ago.
Free rice crackers, green tea and extra rice. Tips and wasted food strongly discouraged by the owners",1
3,"Very good food but service...well, lets be nice and say it was ""odd"". Off for another beer.",-1
2,"Not bad, but not the greatest by a long shot. Good for a cheap and quick dinner or lunch, but not much else.
Ordered the chicken katsu, which was pretty good and miso soup. Pretty standard, but when you're cold and freezing (as I was back in January 2010 when I ate here), miso soup is AWESOME. 
If I'm ever in town, probably won't make the trek over here...",-1
3,"I used to come here a lot, but have mostly stopped going since finding out that there is meat stock in all the katsu curries, including the vegetable one which leaves only maki and other cold dishes for vegetarians :(
 It is otherwise a fun, if slightly cramped, experience. This is great value food for central London, and it's a good relaxed place for a quick meal if you're catching a movie in Leicester Square. I just wish they did more I could eat!",-1
5,"Great food, great atmosphere, great service... if you can get a table! :)
 One of the best Japanese restaurants in the area, and a huge cut above the likes of Wagamama.",1
5,"An awesome way to experience Chinatown! The soup, sashimi, tea, salad, rice, and everything else were very tasty and came out quickly. The staff are also very attentive",1
4,Limited sushi selection but fresh and delicious. Great value for money.,1
3,"After skirting by this place maybe 87 times in my life...I finally decided to go in.  And I've repeated that decision.  So that means it's 3 stars (somehow this review seems very unenthused).
Great prices and tasty noodle and rice dishes (unagi mmm!) - I would skip the sushi though, seriously...just no.  If you're looking for something that's open relatively late for this city, perhaps after a show (I had just watched Jude Law's modern portrayal of Hamlet, complete with skinny jeans), then this would be the spot to go to.  
Don't expect to be able to sit and wax lyrical over something or other for hours and hours; it's in the heart of Chinatown and next to a bar complete with colorful patrons spilling out looking for a bite.  
I do love people watchin here though !!",-1
4,"You get a lot to choose from in this part of London so it can be very confusing. Tokyo Diner is one of those rare places in this area where you can guarantee good food and excellent service.
Many places in the city will treat you like tourists and often the food is simply not that good unless you are willing to pay to venture the more expensive choice restaurants. Tokyo diner is therefore a rare find.
I therefore go here for a quick lunch and order the Chicken Teriyaki Bento box which I highly recommend. This place is excellent value for money. I suggest you give it a try.",1
5,"The Tokyo Diner is the best place to go for some good value sushi in Central London. Its just a short walk from Leicester Square tube station, and its open till late. This makes it a great place to go for a light bite to eat in case you are totally past the reasonable dinner-time due to a late movie or show. 
Contrary to expectation, they hold a different view to service and its value. The menu lists the inclusive prices for each item, with service charge as well. They don't accept tips either. The service is excellent - they serve green tea and rice crackers as soon as you arrive, and keep refilling your cup through the evening for free. 
I love the hospitable efficiency at this Japanese diner. There are some good value Sushi sets at 6 pounds and more. There is a large variety of starters and some soups as well. I would strongly recommend visiting this place if you love sushi, and if you don't, well you just might start to.",1
5,"Well what people say about London is quite true, food ain't all that great. But this place won my heart over. While my 2 week stay in London, for the first couple of days kebabs and pizza held me over but it wasn't before long that I started craving for Japanese food. Lo and bohold, I came across this goldmine. What made me even more happier was that the servers spoke Japanese! Service was good, we weren't being ignored or rushed. I find it fascinating that they don't accept tips! 
Will be back in August, can't wait to go back there again!",1
5,"One of my all-time favourite places to eat!
No nonsense, pleasant and great, great food. And a spot of peace and quiet from the hurly-burly.
And it's great for those with challenging diets.",1
4,"I used to go here all the time; went back recently and not much has changed, which is a good thing! It used to be extremely cheap but now it's a bit more. Still very cheap for Soho without being as dodgy as those Chinese buffet places all around the area. Bonuses include complimentary tea, free extra large portions if you want them, and strictly no tipping (which keeps prices even lower in real terms). The food is not extraordinary but there's plenty of seats and it's quick. Lots of people people have a katsu dish of some description because it's reliable, but the bento boxes are also good.
 One minor gripe: they missed one of the dishes from our group and we had to wait quite a long time for it. But they responded well: since it was so late in the end, we asked not to pay for it. They agreed without being stroppy, and it was struck off the bill.",1
4,"Great place to have lunch if you're in Central London. Situated on the edge of China town, this place makes a refreshing change from the sometimes stogy fare on offer. 
The Lunchtime set menu will set you back about £8 and it really does fill you up.
In the evening there is more of an a-la carte feel to the place and the prices go up a fair bit, but it's great for either pre or post theatre munchies.
Well worth a visit.",1
4,"Tokyo Diner is tucked behind the Vue Cinema on the corner, and looks a little odd and unconventional that's because it is - the place is a golden find! The other night, pre-Batman, saw a power cut in this street, but happily there were still tea facilities and an incredibly friendly staff on attendance, easily making up for some dishes being unavailable due to London's dodgy grid.
 2 things to know before you go:
 1. Tokyo Diner have a sustainable food policy, which means no tuna at present, but the rest of the menu more than compensates, including authentic japanese dishes like Zaru Soba (buckwheat noodles on a bamboo mat, you dip the noodles in the given soy-based sauce then slurp), and delicious agedashi tofu which was pretty much inhaled rather than eaten.
 2. No tipping! As they don't tip in Japan, any money mistakenly left on the tables is given to a London homeless charity. This hippy-esque approach only serves to increase my newfound love of the place, I'm so happy to report the food was as good as the philosophy behind it.
 So, excellent pricing structures, a smile on arrival and a great location will make Tokyo Diner my next pre-cinema dinner choice.
 Dinner: around £9-15 per person for food and tea.",1
5,"The best Japanese food I've ever tasted.
The bento box set meals and katsu curry are not to be missed, and try the eda mame if you want to try something new and tasty.
Can get quite busy, but the prices are very good, especially for central London.
If you're ever in the area, and are feeling peckish, be sure to drop in.",1

 Ironically in the middle of Chinatown there is Tokyo Diner, a cheap but decent Japanese restaurant. Even though the owner appears to be English (if you agree with me that Richard Hills does not sound terribly Japanese) the place has a distinct Japanese atmosphere to it. I have just been to Japan couple of months ago and Tokyo Diner feels very much like one of the Izakayas I went to in Kobe. I am talking not only about the furnishing and (as far as I can judge it) Japanese waiters but also the fact that, just like in Japan, tips are not taken, that you pay on the counter when you leave and that green tea (I think it was Hojicha) is served free of charge.
 The menu is really weird but at the same time rather entertaining: you can spend ages reading the detailed description about every dish as well as some trivia about Japan and Japanese food. In addition the menu contains 5 whole pages with allergy information regarding the nuts/seeds and gluten content for each individual dish.
 The food only partly lived up to my expectations. I was a bit disappointed actually by the Hoso-MakiI Set (6.20). The rice was too sticky and the salmon didn't taste that fresh. The vegetarian cucumber and pickled radish maki were much better actually but also they did not quite satisfy my palate which has become used to the outstanding quality of sushi in Japan.
 I love all kinds of Japanese noodles and particularly when I am hungover, as I happened to be at this particular occasion, nothing is comparable to the healing powers of a Japanese noodle soup. I chose the Curry Udon with Chicken (8.20) which was a very decent bowl of soup drenched with the rather mild but strangely addictive flavour of Japanese curry. The udon were not quite Koya quality but really not bad at all.
 It is not the best Japanese restaurant I have ever been to but considering how cheap, friendly and uncomplicated it is, it is well worth a visit for a quick pre-theatre bite or for a hangover cure.",-1
5,"Tokyo Diner is everything you could wish for if you're looking for a no-nonsense delicious Japanese eatery, and comes with an elaborate menu and background information on all the (authentic) dishes.
 The vegetable curry udon were juicy and aromatic, the Tofu Katsu Ju, apparently one of the chef's own creations, brings a smile to my face with its crispy breadcumbed tofu and flavoursome miso based sauce and the edamame are nice and fresh. As a vegetarian, or even vegan, you're more than welcome and they mark vegan dishes especially.
 Then there's the free green tea that the friendly staff top up without needing a prod, free large rice portions (ask for an oumori portion), and the refreshing 'no tips' policy, and I'd say it's a winner. Sugoi!
 (PS: Wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a fancy dining experience, but at the prices offered, it's definitely fantastic value for money)",1
3,"Average.
The sushi menu was limited.  I read a little anecdote on display about how the Japanese will travel across the country (of Japan) for freshly prepared soba noodles.  But, um, the soba noodles I got were so obviously not fresh.  
Is this a dishonest or an ingenious marketing strategy?  I can't decide. 
In any event, Okawari is just down Lisle Street, and it has a bigger sushi menu and lower prices.  If you want a more stereotypically Japanese dining atmosphere, stick with Tokyo Diner.  But you'll get more for your money at Okawari, and that's what counts, I think.",-1
2,"I'm sorry, I just wasn't feeling it. I wanted to like it. God, I wanted to have an awesome meal when I took friends out to thank them for helping me move, but it just didn't happen.
I went with a couple of friends for whom Japanese food is not a specialty and so weren't sure what to order. I gave some advice, but their tastes (ie meat!) are different to mine so they asked the waitress. Very unhelpful. There was just no sense of 'oh try this' or 'if you like that then this is for you'. It was as if she hated being there and was nervous about anyone saying anything that resembled a question and didn't know what to do when it happened.
We ordered edamame to get things started.... which was fine until one of the party found a live maggot crawling over them... ok, so you don't eat the skins, but... just..... no. not for me, thanks. After the earlier 'conversation' with the waitress, we felt at pains to point it out, and we were tired anyway so didn't want to kick up a fuss.
The rest of the food was fine. Nothing spectacular but a good cheap option in a great location, just set back from Charing Cross Road, a minute from Leicester Square station.
I'd like to go and try it again to see if I caught a new girl on a bad night, but I just don't want any more maggots on my food.",-1
5,"Simply astonishing! Authentic dishes, might the most delicious food I have ever eaten. The food is just amazing, portions are as big as they come and on top of that there's green tea for free. There is a wide variety of food to chose from for some reasonable prices. Recommended!",1
5,This restaurant is great it looks so japanese! The sushi was soo good I really love it. The green tea was for free. I cant wait to visit London again and have dinner at Tokyo Diner?,1
5,"Fantastic. Friendly and informal but not in the least bit scruffy- as soon as we sat down we were given a complimentary cup of green tea and rice crackers and our food arrived very quickly. My udon curry was delectable, I've eaten plenty of East Asian food in my time but this was something else: flavoursome and spicy without being too hot and a generous portion to boot. Excellent value for money given the location and drinks are VERY well priced.",1
3,"Before bentos, katsus, sushi and noodles became ubiquitous in London thanks to the like of Japanese Canteen, Wagamama and Wasabi, there was Tokyo Diner. 
Tucked away in a corner in Chinatown, Tokyo Diner is an authentic Japanese-run restaurant serving unadulterated and homely staples of modern Japanese cuisine including katsu curries, udon noodles, donburi, sushi and bentos. The menu and dishes are straight forward, but the quality here is far superior to that of the aforementioned chains. You will actually see Japanese people eating here, which is always a good sign, as are the tight crowds during the evening rush. 
The food quality here is superior to that which I've seen at 99% of the 'Japanese' diners in London though this is in part reflected in the prices. You can get away with spending under 10 pounds but I often find myself going closer to 15. 
I love the Japanese touches which make the dining experience here particularly welcome and authentic. There is no tipping or automatic service charge, you can request a complimentary large-sized portion of rice if you're extra hungry and the nifty automatic door which is cleverly disguised to look rather old and run down is a nice trick too.",-1
3,"""We do not take tips"" 
The above words are what you see first. The food is ok. I had the Mini Una Don ( Grilled Eel served with rice and sauce ) and it was tender and tastes good. 
Don't know why they said ""NO"" to Tuna but serving eel as both are getting on well are on the endangered list!!! They serve hot tea; which I liked as its aids in digestion. 
The first restaurant I visited in China town. I would recommend food lovers to try it.",-1
4,"This is very japanese style restaurant with no tip required. The food is worth the money and there's green tea served unlimited. The atmosphere is very cosy and it's very nice during winter or cold days. Open most of the days and hours, it's definitely a good restaurant for money value and city lives.",1
4,"Having been to Japan I find this the closest to the dining experience there. From the sliding door, great noodles and paying at the desk when you leave. This is as close as your going to get to eating in Tokyo without going there. If you like Japanese food definitely give this a try.",1
5,"Great cheap meals always to be had here! Their portions are very generous and for 10 squid you'd get a full meal. I love their salmon donburi, the freshest salmon sashimi over a bed of rice. You can also ask for more rice free of charge, but the restaurant asks to make sure you are able to finish your meal as to prevent food wastage.",1
4,"This place is quite small and you will probably have to wait if you go during a busy time, but it's worth the wait.  It's got character, lots of maneki neko and decorations from Japan (I want their sushi clock so bad!) and good service.  I had sushi one time and udon noodles another time, and both were very good.",1
5,Really love this place. best japanese restaurant in london so far. will definitely return when visiting the city again,1
4,"The food here is really good. Traditional Japanese. Really good katsu curry. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is the price, though the serving size almost makes up for it.",1
3,"Not bad! I wasn't sure what to expect, but dishes were authentic and good. It's not fair to compare it to Japan, where the ingredients are better quality, but I am glad that a place like this exists, if only because I abhor Wagamama. This is where you can get things like hiya yakko (cold tofu), katsu curry, tsukemono, and una don. Very good value, great hours, and central location.",-1
5,Very good japanese diner. The place is china town in London Soho. The dishes are cheap and cheerful. The servants speaking japanese and english. Awesome ambient. All in all my favorite japanese restaurant in Soho! A good space for discussions of japanese studies.,1
2,"Maybe it was an off night, but I did not have a very good experience here. It's too bad, I had really heard nice things!
 I went for a chicken and egg stirfry-type dish. The panko was soggy and the egg cold. It just seemed like it had been sitting out for ages.
 My friend had the salmon sashimi which looked a bit better, but he wasn't raving by any means. couple those with one beer and one tea and the bill was nearly £30!
 I would have been ok with half that.
 I'll go back just on the off chance that this was an anomoly, but I was not impressed with Tokyo Diner.",-1
4,"Kind of quirky Japanese restaurant that's really all about the food.  There's no décor worth mentioning, but there's a cozy feel to the place nonetheless
Their Bento boxes are all really fantastic and they have a whole selection... each one comes with sushi and a refreshing seaweed salad.  I always go for the veggie box, but my friend swears by the delectableness of the Katsu chicken box.  I also recommend the edamame here - well-steamed and sufficiently salty.
The staff is always extremely fast and efficient, but the establishment is so popular that it still tends to get crowded fast... I've never waited, but I also usually go at pretty off-times.  
Even though the service is great, in-keeping with Japanese tradition, the servers don't accept tips... however, if you insist, they will donate the money to charity - which I just think is so generous and kindly - a real reflection of this place's vibe and ethos.
This philosophy, which flies in the face of greed, is also reflected in the prices... everything is supremely reasonable... especially for sushi and considering the level of quality you're getting.  It may not be the swankiest sushi joint in London, but it's certainly an all-around delicious and enjoyable place.",1
3,"Not bad for a casual and quick dinner.  We had oyakodon bowls I think.  Pretty good.  They confused our orders at first and I had to wait a while for my order.  It's small in there, but warm and cozy to get out of the cold in Leicester Square.",-1
4,"Great food, unpretentious environment in a very convenient location. I recommend this place to people who like Japanese home cooking.",1
4,"Sushi is my favourite Asian food. I recently found out where I can have the freshest and most delicious Sushi. In middle of Soho, at Newport Place, there is a 2 floor petite Japanese restaurant called the Tokyo diner.
Japanese run the restaurant, the service is attentive when needed and discreet when not. Remarkably for Central London the prices are very reasonable.
On arrival they serve green tea and rice munchies. I strongly can recommend the broccoli, eel and the bento boxes (a selection is made for you already). 
This little gem I recommend to couples or a small group of friends. I keep it as my secret hideaway for me and my best friend to catch up after work every week.",1
3,"Think we stepped on the wrong foot upon entry by asking if this place was Japanese -run. The look on the waiter's face was priceless as he said, ""Yes, I'm Japanese is there a problem with that""? Personally, I only eat sushi from Japanese places. Just like I wouldn't go to a Muslim joint to order pork, I don't eat Chinese sushi. Anyway I had the unagi set and then a salmon set after. I wasn't sure if the waiter was going to put some extra unwanted ingredients on my food from pissing him off at the giddy up, but It wouldn't be the first time. The unagi was tiny and for the price I could have gotten a whole eel in Tokyo. The salmon was decent but skint as well. I'd go back if I happened to be in the area but not going out of my way. The menu was interesting if you're into greenpeace and saving the whales and all.",-1
4,"Service, Service, Service. 
You've maybe never had a meal where your hosts were so attentive to your needs, and in a humble restaurant that appears to pay close attention to the ethics of serving food. They refuse to serve some popular sushi fish because of the unsustainable fishing practices that have depleted their stocks; they provide smaller portions for most dishes with the option to get more for a small price in order to prevent wasting food that people don't finish, and to top it all off the price that they ask for the meal is final and there's no haggling over a tip for the service. It's included.
I suppose I should have gotten to the food by now, which is great! Even if you can't have your big eye tuna sashimi, their sushi rolls are tasty and the noodle soups can be quite filling. They also serve beer and sake.
Tokyo Diner isn't very big, and it's not exactly a secret as these reviews and the front window, almost entirely obscured by stickers from various London food guides, can attest. Still, it's a great find and a choice place to stop for a lunch or dinner in the area.",1
3,"Quite decent food, for very basic expectations. You get a meal for £10 that would cost £3 in Tokyo, but nevertheless nothing particularly wrong with what they serve. That particular day, the waitress was unacceptably rude, especially for a Japanese restaurant, but perhaps it was simply bad luck.",-1
5,"A Japanese friend discovered this restaurant and it soon became a favourite of ours (me and my husband). We have eaten here over a period of at least 10 years and have never been disappointed with the food or the service.
 The restaurant is on 3 floors, but the service is excellent no matter which floor you are seated in. 
All of the food is fresh and of excellent quality, and you can have noodle dishes, bento boxes, sushi and loads more! The cost is very reasonable and it's a great place to take friends, especially if you are attending a film in any of the nearby theatres.
 In proper Japanese-style, they don't allow tipping.
 This is one restaurant I always recommend to any friends visiting London.",1
4,"One of those rare central London things - a cheap (for London), reliable and good quality restaurant. Not a place for an occassion, but perfect if you've been out shopping, or are going to the cinema. My favourite is the Salmon Don, warm rice served with salmon sashimi, omlette and seaweed.
 This is a place I often visit on my own, often before meeting friends for afterwork drinks (we all know the dangers of drinking on an empty stomach).",1
5,"I love this place. You sit down to crackers and unlimited green tea and read through the menu which tells you that large portions are free, tips are discouraged (or donated to charity) and that until tuna isn't being fished to extinction they will not be serving it. The restaurant serves a delicious range of food at some very reasonable prices. If you can get there during the week at lunchtimes it's even better value.
 Try it out!",1
4,"This has to be one of the yummiest and cheapest Japanese restaurants in central London, serving food day and night Tokoyo diner is usually always bustling.
 There is a great range of bento boxes, sushi and rice dishes, the only problem is choosing which one to have. But i recommend what ever you have to team it with a plum wine!
 The food is well priced and they do not except tips!
 Nestled on the corner of China town and 2 min's walk from Leicester square make this small restaurant a little gem.",1
3,"Edamame was tasty as it normally is, and the broccoli was really good - cooked in a dashi broth with small pieces of fried tofu - it was served cold, which was surprisingly nice. The sushi was all fresh and the nigiri were a good size. They give you free green tea with your meal as well, and in Japanese fashion, they don't accept tips (anything extra you leave behind goes to a homeless charity). There's also no tuna on the sushi menu as they refuse to serve any unsustainable fish. This part of town is full of little Japanese restaurants but this is one of the best I've been to - it's not fancy inside but the service is friendly, fish is fresh and it's pretty moderately priced for sushi.",-1
5,"Authentic, good food and excellent price / value relation. ""No tip"" policy, free green tea and free large servings on request. Wide selection of typical food including Bento Box menus for GPB 11.50 to GPB 16.40 or an Udon soup for GPB 6.90 all incl. tax and tip!",1
3,"After having to walk across half the city due to student riots (go Tories - radicalize! radicalize!) I decided to stop in here for a quick bite before the long bus ride home. I have been wanting to go here for a while since I saw their vegetarian bento box, advertised as absolutely vegan, and partly intrigued by their marketing strategy of ""no tips - it's just not japanese"" which is prominently displayed on signs throughout the restaurant. Because I was on my own I was shown downstairs, into a somewhat depressing cellar space. Before ordering you can specify that you are extra hungry, and get a larger helping of rice for free (apparently if you do this too late you are out of luck for some reason - why you can't  get this if you ask later is beyond me. Another nice addition is the free Japanese tea; though I did have to go out of my way to get them to refill (service was only OK and it was one of those places where you can't seem to make eye contact with the wait-staff). The cost of the bento box is not cheap - 10.50 Pounds - but that's probably about standard for this area. The food itself was so-so. The four tiny sushi were just ok, and definitely not fresh. There was very little in the way of wasabi. The rice was OK, and the cooked vegetables tasty, if not stellar. The sesame seaweed salad was excessively oily. The best thing about this place was that it was reasonably filling, and there were no hidden costs; the downside is that the food just wasn't that nice. If you can get a table upstairs the ambiance would certainly be better.",-1
4,"Good option for Japanese comfort food in London's Chinatown. I like the tonkatsu and the katsu curry here. Tokyo Diner was a regular stop on my more recent trips to London when the pound sterling hit stratospheric heights against the US dollar.  There is seating on three different floors, but the best, IMO, is the ground floor.",1
4,"This restaurant has a great location just off Charing Cross road near Leicester Square. I've been twice to this restaurant and I'm glad I went the second time because the first left me with a bad impression.
The secret to this place is that it is not about sushi. If your looking for a Sushi restaurant instead of a Japanese food restaurant I suggest you look elsewhere.
The second time I went I ordered the Chicken Katsu Bento and it was extremely good. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the sashimi portion, which consisted of two slivers of low quality salmon.
The service is fast and friendly. All food, excepting the sushi, was great quality, well prepared and very tasty. The price is very reasonable for what you get, so although it isn't cheap (or expensive) it is very high value.
Not a michelin star ""foody"" destination but a great place to enjoy an efficient, tasty and good value meal.",1
3,"Perhaps the most authentic Japanese restaurant in London. I do not find the food as cheap as some reviewers implied, unless you are ordering from the off-peak deal. Misato, another Japanese cheap eat not too far from Tokyo Diner does cheaper food at larger portions. Tokyo Diner serves decent Japanese food but unfortunately not memorable. However, I do like their no-tips policy. Coming from Asia, I don't particularly agree with tipping, especially under pressure. Will I be back? Probably.",-1
5,"Wonderful place - good, simple sushi, great location and a great price - and how refreshing to find a sushi restaurant that will not serve tuna for ethical reasons!",1
4,"Excellent value for money in central London, Tokyo Diner serves, unsurprisingly, tasty Japanese food. The bento boxes are particularly good with a nice selection of different things. The chicken katsu curry was also good, served with a mountain of rice, crispy on the outside but not too grreasy, succulent on the inside. You can also go large on your portion size for a nominal extra. It's also open quite late which is good if you find yourself starving after the cinema or a late one at work, although it doesn't quite stretch to post-pub hours.",1
4,"Great value. Simple (and seemingly traditional) Japanese food served up in big portions. 
Friendly and straightforward with nice extras like free tea and free extra rice when you ask for 'omori'. 
Highly recommended for tasty interesting food on a budget.",1
5,"I've spent many a happy evening at Tokyo Diner. London is fully of pricey Japaneses, catering for poncey business people, but this is a fantastic option for people who like Japanese food but happen not to be investment bankers! The sushi set andkatsu curry are especially good value, and there's a great choice of Japanese beers, eg, Kirin, Asahi. It's a very cute little cubby hole, and all the staff are Japanese. You really do feel like you could be in a little corner of Tokyo somewhere. Like restaurants in Japan, they do not take tips. Overall, the management obviously prides itself on providing a great, good value service - 100% recommended!",1
5,I will always love the Tokyo Diner as it was the FIRST place I ever ate sushi. It's a fantastic little place - run by an Englishman who lived in Japan for a long time. It's the perfect place to introduce someone gently to Japanese cuisine. The sushi nigiri sets are lovely and very reasonable. Great katsu and curry too. Nice decor and ambience - really wonderful little gem in the heart of Chinatown,1
5,"Tokyo Diner is one of the cheapest restaurants in central London with terrific-value katsu curry and free omori portions of rice. A couple eating here will come away with change from £30 after eating a main, a miso soup starter and having a drink each. The katsu curry - whether chicken or pork - is the most popular dish here, but the sushi is also excellent with good salmon and tuna. It's also big enough to be able to find tables for people even on a Saturday night. This mild curry is made in generous portions. It is mild with potato and carrot forming the bulk of the dish. The breadcrumb-covered meat sits atop the curry.",1
4,"For a quick and easy oriental meal, Tokyo Diner is very consistent. Good food, reasonable prices and a friendly atmosphere make this a pleasant stop for a quick meal. The food is good, with a menu covering a variety of Japanese meals and a selection of sushi. Its at the bottom end of China town, near Leicester Square and so can be visited without needing to wade into the chaos of China town itself. Not much else to be said  it does what it says on the tin!",1
2,"supremely average in every way. The sushi is bland, and as sign of a poor sushi place, has no yellowtail (hamachi). I also ordered udon noodles with chicken - the chicken was great, but the soup was tepid, and pretty average. I found the copy writing on the menu to be condescending (slurp your soup and open your mouth a little to take in air as you slurp - it improves the flavour.. (awful)). Ah, but the green tea is fabulous. I will not be going back",-1
4,"Lovely little Japanese diner 2 minutes fom Leicester Square station. Very cheap for central London, but great quality food and fantastic service. I was on my own and felt totally comfortable sitting in there at a little table - no double takes or incredulous/pitying looks! They have vegan dishes here too which although I didn't have any the table next to me were cooing and exclaiming over their deliciousness!
I had some sushi, tea and a glass of wine and it came to less than a tenner, I would heartily recommend this little place (and it is little).
I love their no tipping policy too - they make it perfectly clear that the price they sell for is the price they want you to pay and state that if someone accidentally leaves some money on the table they automatically give it to St Martin's in the field - but to save the embarrassment, why not just put it in the collection box by the till anyway?
Someone else on here said they felt patronised by the little written comments like We don't mind if you slurp your noodles whereas I just found them funny and sweet notes meant to put you at your ease.",1
5,"Low prices, high quality. This is one of my favourite hidden gems of central London. It's open late (limited menu after 11pm) and the food is fantastic. You get free unlimited green tea and a little something to snack on while you wait for your food. Everything is prepared fresh, in house. One quirk is that they don't accept tips. If you try to be sneaky and leave a tip anyway, they will just donate the money to charity. Lovely people, lovely place. Notably, they're open 365 days a year.",1
5,"very nice good ! and very thypique , i like this !",1
1,Waited patiently for 45 mins for a meal that never arrived. Won't be rushing back,-1
4,"Good solid Japanese cuisine with no qualms. Totally unpretentious, reminiscent of a Tokyo noodle house. I like to have the katsu don, which is a solid meal of pork cutlet and rice cooked together with a savory omlet, tasty with their brown sauce. I've never had to wait for a meal (no reservations), and the prices can't be beaten. Great place to go if you're out on the town and feel the munchies coming on.",1
5,"Tokyo Diner is such a relaxed spot. It is styled like a Japanese restaurant in the middle of Tokyo. From the side way sliding doors, natural wood interior and Japanese waitresses all waiting to take your order, you'll feel like you've just arrived in Japan. I've been here several times because the place is non-complicated. The menus have everything you'd expect from a sushi restaurant with ramen and great bento box dishes to enjoy. I usually come here for the lunch time bento box and I find them very filling. I recommend this place to my friends and to you as it is a hassle-free Japanese zone. However, it does get busy during the evenings so coming during the day when the sun is out is probably best. Lots of Japanese calligraphy on the wall and a good view of what's happening downstairs in Newport place. It is a good place to have a conversation with your friends and there are also pegs on the walls for people to hook their jackets and bags for extra security. The price ranges from £7, which is good enough for such a lively and peaceful atmosphere. I found that the sunny days in the upstairs area were the best days to come here. This is a good place for couples, yet you might have to book in advance if you'd like to bring a group of four. The Tokyo diner is not large enough for big parties unfortunately.; (",1
5,"Came here after a visit to the British Museum and was able to sang a table. The service was excellent and prompt, and I opted for the two course menu. The house wine was also good for the price.
The scallops were perfectly cooked and paired well with the apples. The duck really shined - the skin was crispy and the meat was succulent and delicious. I also had the tarte tatin for desert, which was not overly sweet and paired with a very nice custard.
The atmosphere was cozy and warm, and the prices were reasonable for the location. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.",1
2,"Poor service and bland food. I'm pretty easy to please but neither the food or service could make this a place I would recommend. 
This is an overpriced tourist trap at the best. 
The French onion soup was bland. How does a French restaurant serve bland French onion soup?
Our fries were brought out 20 minutes after the rest of our food. 
So many better places to eat than this and at much better prices.",-1
5,"Came here with a large group for dinner. We all got the two courses set because we were hungry. Sets come with fresh bread with oil (yum!). We also ordered two bottles of wine. Service was slow but polite. The atmosphere was incredibly relaxing and it felt like one could stay at the table all night talking and unwinding. I got the braised lamb with stuffed mushrooms as a first course. The mushrooms were well seasoned and topped with a generous helping of herbs and goat cheese (double yum!). The lamb was cut into thick, juicy slices and resting on a bed of roast potatoes, steamed carrots and green beans, mashed potatoes, and ratatouille. Absolutely fabulous. Everything tasted amazing. The only incident was the small deep fried ball of meat that came on the side of my plate. I thought it looked like some sort of deep fried organ so I didn't eat it... I wonder if it landed on my plate by mistake during serving.",1
5,Fabulous little bistro we happened to find while getting away from the normal tourist trap establishments.  Owners were working hard as staff was either on holiday or out ill.  They did a terrific job and we loved our delicious meal and wine.  Everything was fresh and made to order.  Prices were extremely reasonable.,1
5,"We headed here after spending an afternoon at the museum. We were slightly early for our booking, but were seated immediately, while waiting for our friend to arrive.
Service was lovely. They only had 2 meal menus, but since we were hungry, they allowed us to order extra starters.
The food was excellent. From starters to desserts - pate, lamb kidneys, the sea bass, lamb and duck - each one perfectly cooked. And some of the best French fries that I've eaten in a very long time. 
They had some excellent wines and the whisky cheesecake was outstanding!
Wish I had found this place before my mum and dad visited, would have loved to take them here on one of their many visits to the museum.",1
5,"This was a delightful and cozy spot! We we thrilled to find it! We love French food and this place hit the nail on the head. 
The food is incredibly reasonable especially considering how amazing it all tastes! 
The staff was wonderful - they answered our questions happily and were very attentive. They even offered some suggestions of things to go on our trip to Paris. 
My husband and I shared some wine, French of course, and were pleased! 
For appetizers we had the goose rillete and  baked goat cheese - it was an amazing start to our meal. 
For dinner my husband had roast duck, which was perfectly cooked, and I had seared sea bass which was delicious! The skin had a crispness to it without drying out the fish. 
We ended the meal with cheesecake which honestly, was the best we've had! The texture was almost whipped it was so smooth and light.  
Without a doubt I would recommend this restaurant. There is nothing about the experience that I could give lower than 5 stars to. If you ever find yourself in London, on or near Bloomsbury way, stop in for a bite. You won't regret it!",1
5,"What a treat! We ducked in out of the rain and found a table - our good luck. The service, the food (bouillabaisse x 2, bread, salad, wine, coffees), and the setting were wonderful, it's a very charming place. 
   Other choices include a veg prix fixe menu and assorted food for carnivores. Good value, a great meal.",1
4,"I travel to London fairly often for work so I am usually out dining alone. The food was fantastic and the service was pretty good. I had two lovely ladies waiting on me, however, I asked the less experienced waitress for a wine recommendation and she had no idea what to say, so I ended up with a bottle of house wine, which was perfectly fine, but I would have loved a recommendation on a proper french wine as I'm always looking to broaden my palate and learn more about wine in general.
Still, a wonderful experience overall, highly recommend it!",1
5,"This tiny French cafe was a great choice during our stay in London. We were craving something fresh and yet still delicious. They have a pre-fix lunch menu with a salad and a meat option. The salad the day we visited was a roasted pear salad, it look so good but I wasn't hungry enough for multiple courses. I did end up with a salad though and so did another guest in my party. I ordered a butternut squash and goat cheese salad and it was perfectly dressed and a larger serving- I would recommend! The other salad ordered was a warm chicken and avocado salad- which was also very tasty and a large portion. We also had a steak and Brie sandwich on a fresh baguette- it was perfection. The bread was so fresh and soft yet the outside perfectly crispy. Everything we ordered was great and I would highly recommend this spot! The upstairs area is smaller and doesn't have air conditioning, which is fine normally but we were visiting on an 80 degree day- so just keep that in mind! The downstairs area is larger and cooler, but lacks the charm of the upstairs area, however this would be better for larger parties! Go here!",1
3,"Maybe I was just unlucky, ordering the wrong dish... I couldn't eat more than half - it tasted weird. The bread had little gnats flying on it too and was too hard, like it'd been cut up hours before. 
I like the ambience of the place though, and the waitress, though she seemed stressed. I hope she gets a vacation or something good soon.",-1
4,"We really enjoyed Savoir Faire.  Although our children are not fond of French food, the menu had enough options to please everyone.  The waitresses were very helpful and friendly. We found the food to be good, and the atmosphere pleasant.",1
4,"My friend and I had a late lunch here around 2:30 pm on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. We came from the British Museum, which was just a short walk away. It was fairly empty at the time, so we had our pick of indoor and outdoor seating; we picked a small table inside, right by a window, and got a nice view of the street and nearby buildings. There was also plenty of seating, as well as toilets, downstairs, although no one was sitting downstairs because it was so sunny outside (the downstairs area was quite dark but would probably be cozy in the evenings). We were greeted promptly by our server.
Both of us ordered the butternut squash and goat cheese salad (my friend is a vegetarian). The food came out pretty quickly. I was pleased with how generous they were with the toppings; they had completely covered the greens with goat cheese, sliced nuts, and squash. The salad came with dressing on, but I'm sure you could ask for it on the side. It was really tasty; there might actually have been too much cheese, but as goat cheese is my favorite, I was pretty happy with it. The salads came with 1 basket of bread that we split; we wound up ordering more, since there wasn't that much in the 1st basket. The bread was accompanied by some seasoned olive oil, which also had sesame seeds in; it was pretty addicting for me as a bread lover. However, as it was a French restaurant, I was expecting the bread to be better; it was good, but I wasn't as blown away as I have been at some other French/Italian/Spanish restaurants.
For dessert we split (well, I had 75% of it) a pear tarte tatin (when asked, the server informed us the dessert special of the day was mango sorbet). The tarte was a good size and really tasty; it was served warm. If my friend had been hungrier, I would've wanted to order 2 desserts, as the tarte wasn't really big enough to split equally between 2 people (although I have a big appetite so your mileage may vary).
The restaurant had a great atmosphere and a nice view of the street. We were allowed to take our time and weren't bothered much by anyone throughout our leisurely meal. The facilities and tables were clean. The ceiling was decorated with some humorous sayings, so look up if you visit. Our meal came out to be about £15/person, including 1 glass of wine, 1 dessert, and an extra basket of bread. I really enjoyed my lunch here and would happily return if I'm ever in the area again.",1
5,Lovely lunch where everyone left happy and satisfied with their meal.  Excellent service.,1
5,Great French food. Good value and price for London. I love when you can get your own carafe of wine. I had the fish special and my husband had the lamb. Both were delicious. Highly recommend.,1
4,"A cute spot to grab good food and a drink or two.
I enjoyed the Aperol spritz. It wasn't too bitter and it was refreshing. 
The bread you get with dinner is nice and soft. It's served with oil for dipping.
For dinner I ordered a mixed greens salad and the vegetarian tagine. The mixed greens (smallish) included frilly greens, a few slices of tomato and a creamy dressing. It was alright. The tagine was pretty good though. It included cooked carrots and apricots in a flavorful sauce with mint over couscous. I just wish there were a few more different veggies in there. 
My sister ordered the large vegetarian butternut squash and goat cheese green salad. It was super flavorful and the portion was generous. She also ordered the fries (chips), which were a little thinner than I normally like but not bad. I do like how there are several vegetarian options.
Our waitress was pleasant and helpful. 
The decor is fun and nice. I enjoyed the quotes written on the ceiling.
If I come back to London I would visit Savoir Faire again.",1
5,"Loved it! Great food, reasonable prices, great service. Very small place and not a chain. Would definitely recommend!",1
5,"SO. GOOD. 
I've been for lunch a couple of times and simply cannot fault this place. 
The service is exceptional and they are even accommodating when I have a baby with me. 
The food can take a while to come out but when it's as good as it is here, I can't complain. 
The lunch deal is a steal. 
The staff are incredible. Thank you.",1
5,"I had the vegetarian 2 course special. The goat cheese caprese was good. The Aubergine ""cannelloni"" were amazing. They were strips of eggplant rolled around a mixture of ricotta with olives drizzled with tahini, and surrounded by green beans, potatoes and roasted tomatoes. If someone would cook like that for me, I'd cheerfully become a vegetarian. One of the best things I've ever had. The service was friendly cheerful and the whole experience was great.",1
5,"After a day at the British Museum we found this location via the other great reviews on Yelp, and it didn't  disappoint.",1
4,"Visiting London for the first time, a friend and I tried this restaurant. It was in close walking distance to the London National Museum. The food was food and they have a two course special for early dinner. However, if you do not have a reservation you are not allowed to sit on the ground floor but are quickly whisked away to the basement to dine. The food came out quickly, however the waitress disappeared for a long time when we were dining and it took about 30 minutes longer to finally get our check.",1
5,"This quaint little French restaurant was one of my favorites that I had visited in London. The food is authentically mouthwatering, not to mention for a great price. The staff was exceptionally nice. The whole evening was elegant, unpretentious, and definitely something I'd like to repeat. Flawless!",1
4,"This place is indeed an affordable French gourmet restaurant. They have a 24£ 3 course meal deal that is very good value for money! Usually when you choose a set menu you get very limited choices but this place has so much to chose from it was hard to pick just one! As a starter I had the chicken liver which was REALLY yummy. As a main I had the  beef bourguignon which was really tasty. We ended the meal with a chocolate mousse which was good. 
The service was really good. Our waitress was very friendly and made great recommendations when asked. 
The place is a bit tight and if you sit downstairs it is windowless. 
I would definitely go again and highly recommend this place!",1
5,"STELLAR SERVICE. They were open Xmas day, didn't need a reservation, the food was delicious, the ambiance was ""quaint Parisian cafe,"" and the service was exceptional.",1
5,"This was the best meal my wife & I had in London.  We arrived just after lunch service had ended (after a long day of wandering around the British Museum) and were still able to order off the lunch menu.  We had the restaurant to ourselves for a little while and we felt welcome and very comfortable in the cozy and inviting dining room.
My wife had the steak and brie baguette with onions and horseradish mayonnaise and I had the steak frites. Both of our meals were simply amazing. I followed it off with some chocolate mousse which was the best mouse I have had since my last visit to Paris last year.
This restaurant should be a must stop for anyone in this part of London.",1
4,"Very clean (although small) tables, toilets, and nice service. Had lunch combo for £14+ it actually charges me £16+ maybe for the service fee. The combo comes with a starter+entrée or entrée+dessert, either way you like. I have the soup of the day for starter, which is chicken vegetables soup. It was really good. The soup is neither too salty nor greasy, with lentil, carrot, and some other veggies. I ordered fish soup for entrée and I think it would be better if they can squeeze more lemon juice in it. 
The carafe and water glasses are not very clean though. But the bread is superb. My boyfriend ordered Lamb kidney for starter and Duck leg for entrée, he said it was flavorless but I think they are okay. 
This cafe would be good for you if you are looking for some delicate food with light flavor, and also, if you have enough time since the waiting time is a little long than I have expected.",1
5,"This is an amazingly affordable French restaurant with a set menu which include (joy!) a good selection of vegetarian options. The interior is cosy (but there is a downstairs eating area in the basement as well) and slightly 'shabby-chic' (which extends to the cutlery and glassware as well).
The main event is the food: the two course menu is £24, but there is a cheaper vegetarian menu as well. Desserts are £5.90. For the price, in this area of London, it represents fabulous value, as the quality is very good, mostly in the classic French style.
On two recent visits, service was very good - friendly but unobtrusive, and they made a real effort to seta us when they were busy one evening.
I shall be back.",1
4,"We went without booking, but the waitress so kindly helped us get a table instead of just turning us away. Through the dinner, service was top notch, and I really appreciated it -- never take it for granted! 
Food was solid as well. I had pork belly, which was very flavourful and rich together with the purée. My bf ordered foie gras as starter, which was probably one of the best I ever had. 
Absolutely adored the ambience -- very artsy and cozy at the same time. Great lighting and perfect for dates. 
Would love to go back soon!",1
4,"With a quiet and quaint atmosphere, this restaurant provided genuine French cuisine. The Christmas menu provided only a few dinner options and only 3-4 alcoholic drinks to choose from. Of the small amount of choices, the food was savory. The price was on the heavy side of what usually is attributed to this restaurant (due to the holiday limitations). The staff was friendly and made accommodations for canceling an order midway through our meal when one of our diners decided they weren't hungry (no charge).",1
1,"This is the worst restaurant in London. We have the worst experienced, the receptionist lady is very rude and un accommodative, she showed us a table and prepare the table just wiping it with wet clothes and sat the utensils down on the wet table, so dirty We are very shocked by her action. The whole place looks really dirty and unhealthy",-1
4,"Excellent food and very close to British museum. This place serves the best French food in London for the price. Two course meal for about 23, might sound like a lot but the quality is excellent. The goose appetizer and lamb were the meal for me and it was delicious. 
Service can be very slow especially if you sit downstairs but the food compensated for it.",1
5,"This French gem is flawless. Food deserves a Michelin star for its high quality preparation and presentation. The service is also peerless. Staff is friendly and amicable. What else can be said---We've eaten here twice for dinner and once for lunch in just the last week. I can and would eat here daily if I could. If you enjoy a high standard like I do, this shiny little bauble is for you! Magnifique! London has so many great places to eat, but this place stands out for its quality sure, but the vibe is also great, no pretense, just fine food at great prices. Feels like a local Parisian bistro. Go!",1
5,"This restaurant is a true gem! Loved the food and service. I highly recommend this place.
The steak was delicious as well as the bouillabaisse.  If you are in the area I would definitely try it out!!",1
5,"Great French food and great prices. The server was very nice and knowledgeable about the food and the atmosphere was romantic. Perfect dinner for our last night in London. The foe grass was fabulous, cooked perfectly, every ingredient on the plate made sense. We had wild mushrooms with fresh goat cheese, pork belly, beef bourgeoning and bread pudding toffee, perfect way to end a perfect meal.
I am definitely recommending this restaurant to anyone that visits or lives in London.",1
5,"Hands down--Wow! My husband and I were in London on vacation for 10 days. We were staying in the Covent Garden area and went to Savoir Faire for dinner one evening. Easily the best meal we had in London (yet nowhere near the most expensive). We hit some big name restaurants and none of the cooking was as spot on as Savoir Faire. The preparations were beautiful and delicious. 
Savoir Faire is a small, unpretentious, neighborhood restaurant. It is casual and comfortable, but the food is the epitome of French style. We had a very affordable bottle of Chateaudeuf-du-pape. I have to admit that I have forgotten after a almost a month away from home what we had for a starter. We both ordered chicken for dinner. It was moist and delicious with a wonderful array of vegetables, perfectly prepared. We shared a dessert. Everything was perfect. 
This is the restaurant I will be talking about and recommending to anyone I know heading to London. It is small, so make a reservation, but it is a must try.",1
4,"So I have to admit...  I'm not really a fan of French food.  It's usually so rich and heavy and that's just not my thing.  When my coworkers and I were on a trip to London and the cuisine agreed upon by the group was French I was not super excited.  But this meal ended up being great!  
They have a two course set menu for around 23 pounds.  The various appetizers tried at our table were the grilled fig with goat cheese, the octopus, the mussels, and the fried halloumi - all were excellent and original.  I would give a recommendation, but really that's probably try them all.  The mussels may have been the most unexpected in serving and flavor - they came out of their shells in a special serving dish, and the sauce was incredibly garlicky and delicious.
For entrees, our table had the duck, beef bourguignon, lamb shank, and the vegetable plate.  Again, everyone loved theirs.  The sauces were delicious and balanced out the meat perfectly.
And after our fantastic meals, we couldn't stop without dessert.  Our table shared creme brulee, chocolate mousse, and tarte tatin.  And again, everything was excellent.  The chocolate mousse was very rich without being too sweet.  The tarte tatin was very different from ones we have had in the US - the apple was a different texture but delicious.  The creme brulee was excellent as well.
The restaurant itself was small and very cute.  A great ambiance.  There were paintings all over the wall, which were definitely different than what we would see in the US, but it was a great little European find for us on our trip.",1
3,Food was not amazing. Just ok. We were looking for true French cuisine but this was pretty plain.,-1
3,"Inaptly named. Nice food, poor service. In a restaurant w few people folks itching to get their bill. Food was tasty, especially chocolate mousse, and good price, just slow and hard to get attention w service",-1
2,"Food was excellent but the chef was clearly overtaxed on a Friday night, leading to delays in food arriving. To make matters worse the owner and his wife, gruff white haired elderly couple, arrived and were served their food immediately, bumping me and other customers back (my entree didn't arrive until an hour after ordering).  Owner then curtly refused to take anything off the bill though his own meals had preempted the paying customers.",-1
4,"This was my very first dinner in London, and I was definitely satisfied. A few friends and I came here after seeing how it was so highly reviewed on Yelp, and when we got to the restaurant we were surprised (but I guess happy) at how empty yet small it was. There was probably only one other table occupied, and a total of 7 tables in the room we were seated.
The menu contained a lot of options, but I wanted something light so I ordered one of the vegetarian dishes. I can't remember what it's called, but it had mushrooms topped with mashed garbanzo beans/chickpeas and a side of broccoli and carrots. I'll admit that when the food first came out I was a bit skeptical since it's not the prettiest dish, but the first bite destroyed any doubt. The taste and texture of the mushroom paired with that of the garbanzo beans was amazing, and the broccoli/carrots were wonderfully cooked as well. I especially liked how the sauce was light and only used to enhance the taste (rather than drenching the food in sauce, which is kind of common nowadays in a lot of restaurants). After finishing I was well-satisfied and happy.
Overall a great place to eat if you like authentic French food! I loved my experience here (food, service, and the super cute decor).",1
2,"I really like this restaurant,  the food is amazing and the service is friendly.  The prices are reasonable and the decor and atmosphere are both great. 
The waiter when we were there personally recommended one of the wines, and it was lovely to see some of the diners chatting to each other at different tables,  like it's a place to be socialable and actually talk to other people - something which is very special when you see it in London. 
I couldn't give this restaurant a higher rating though because of its 2 star hygiene rating by Camden council,  I don't really understand why such an otherwise amazing restaurant would take such a lax attitude to food satety but it isn't a good sign. 
Hopefully they'll take it on board and try to improve as it's otherwise a wonderful independent restaurant in central London, a welcome alternative to so many identikit chains.",-1
5,"Holy moly... Fantastic food!! So I guess I like French food? If THIS represents French then YES! I started with the baked goat cheese, moved onto the duck, and wow. The flavors are simply astonishing... Although the duck texture was average. Even still.. Epic dish! This is a return over and over places folks! 
Oh and... Price? It will make you spin your head... The prices are that of a typical chain... Not too high. How? I dunno but I am coming back tomorrow.
Ok update (3 minutes after posting!) the texture of the duck is killing me... SO chewy! But... Still 5 star. Why? Flavor... Unique flavor in the whole dish... Everything on the plate is so enriched in unique and DELICIOUS flavor I don't care. Plus it's only a few pieces like that.
Sorry 4-star review people who always do 4 starts even when they say it's great! (Why oh why do people do that?)... This is 5 star at its best!
Oh... And I hate the French. But you get five stars for food!",1
3,"I was looking forward to this meal due to the strong reviews...However I was disappointed. To start, I ordered the grilled figs with blue cheese and mint. The figs were neither grilled nor was there mint. In fact the figs were raw and cold. For my main entree, I ordered their honey glazed duck with red wine jus. While the flavors were good, the duck was way over cooked by French standards. If you order the duck you must you must clarify that you want it medium rare.",-1
5,"Cest tres bon!!
Well this was just a fantastic evening I have to say. The owners ever present in the dining room help to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Stepping off a busy London street you are immediately transported to a bistro that could be anywhere in France though I like to imagine myself being somewhere in Provence, wild fields of lavender filling the air with an aroma like to no other....anyway....back to the food!
For my starter I went for Goose Rillettes served with Spiced Plums, the rillettes had an excellent texture, neither too fatty or to smooth, there was still a nice consistency to it. I sometimes find rillettes made more like a pate, blitzed to hell and back. The goose with the sweet and spicy plums was a lovely match and very tasty.
For my main Herb-crusted Rump of Lamb with Celeriac Puree, Balsamic braised Beetroot and Herb and Tomato Jus. Im a sucker for lamb with a crust and this was done supremely well. Cooked with great attention in a pan then oven roasted to melt in the crust the lamb was still beautifully pink. Celeriac is one of my favourite vegetables and the puree was smooth and well seasoned. Delicious.
Washed all of the lovely food down with a bottle of red, reasonably priced and delicious.
Finished the night with a French coffee and toddled off into the night very content.",1
5,"The reviews turned out to be spot on. This is some extremely fine french cooking for an affordable price. There are two menus, the lighter menu is 15 pounds and includes an entree and your choice of a dessert or appetizer and then there is the 23 pound dinner menu that includes an appetizer and entree. Both are available at dinner periods and both are delicious (I ordered off the pricier dinner menu while my partner ordered off the 15 pound menu and we were both beyond satisfied). I had a glass of house red (£4) and we both shared a dessert afterwards (£6.50) and the best dinner I've had in London came to a well-spent £50.
Service was prompt and friendly and they were even able to fit us in without a reservation, though we came very early. If you plan to eat here after 5:30 I would definitely make a reservation. Off of the cheaper menu I highly recommend the duck legs and off the more expensive menu the lamb shank is delectable.
PROs:
- Great french cooking
- Not dirt cheap, but for what you get it feels like theft
- Very close to the British Museum, 5 min from the main entrance. About 10 minutes walk from Holborn station.
CONs:
- It gets busy quickly, even on weekdays. Make a reservation unless you are willing to take a risk.",1
5,"I had lunch here 6 weeks ago after visiting the British Museum and loved it so much I came back today and brought my parents.
The fig with ham and goat cheese is absolutely amazing, as are the beef bourguignon and the lamb shanks. The bouillabaisse is amazing if you are looking for a lighter option.
Get the house wine by the glass, it's great too.
Overall amazing value for money.
Only con is food takes a little too much time but 100% worth it!",1
4,"Strange decoration but excellent food. All ingredients are self made, including the sauces (hence the name). Good value too given the quality of the dishes. Try it.",1
4,"We ate here on our first night  in London. The bistro was a short walk from the hotel. We also had lunch here on our last day in London. 
Ambiance: small casual restaurant, dining on the street level and a dining room downstairs. Not very lavish but quaint. The location is great for people watching, located on a busy intersection. The narrow staircase and lighting on the way to the loo could use some work.
Service: two servers at dinner were very helpful, efficient and welcoming. The servers for lunch were not as pleasant, one hardly said a word but smiled a lot. The other server yelled at tired Japanese tourists who sat on the chairs outside. Not very hospitable.
Food: we really enjoyed our dinner here. I ordered the baked mussels which came in an escargot dish and had the traditional butter, herb and garlic butter. Great for dipping the wonderful bread. My wife ordered the steak frites and I had the calf's liver. Both were very good. No dessert. 
Lunch was not as flavorful. We ordered salad, Caesar and the house salad. Neither were exciting, lettuce was not crispy and the vinaigrettes were not very flavorful. Add the less than enthusiastic servers, I wish we went elsewhere for lunch.",1
4,"I came here with a friend for a bit of a nicer dinner out. We are both students and they advertise this place as an inexpensive gourmet French restaurant...perfect! 
The service started off as very attentive and we ordered a bottle of house white wine. The waitress quickly brought us a bottle, poured it, and left. Before we knew it we realized she had poured us each a glass of red wine-not what we ordered. This issue would have also been prevented if they showed us the bottle of wine and permitted us an initial taste as every other restaurant does. After much confusion with another waitress who was on her first day and barely spoke English, she was able to help us to amend the issue and she then brought us our white wine. She filled the glasses to the brim-no exaggeration.
The starter and main meal was delicious. My friend got the mussels which I would highly recommend. The lentil moussaka was also delicious. Salads were pretty standard, nothing amazing. Overall I would recommend this restaurant.",1
5,It's a casual French having only a course menu for dinner. It's reasonable but tasty and a big portion!! I liked the soup with smoked salmon and cheese and British traditional beef stew.....,1
3,"3 Stars = ""A-OK"" and that's how I felt about this place. The food was good (4 stars), the atmosphere and decor makes it more of a homey places. Basically, the two didn't match well together. It almost seems like a great top chef lost his job at a Michelin Star restaurant and went to work at a ""normal"" restaurant.
Whether or not this is a good or bad thing is up to you and your personality. I usually expect the two to match because of the company I'm with, but if you are just a casual dinner looking for great food, this is your place. The food and it's presentation is far beyond the way the restaurant looked and operated.",-1
5,This is a gem of a restaurant. We went before the theater and had wonderful food- the mussels were wonderful as well as lamb shank and duck. Very reasonably priced also.,1
5,"It's rare for me to return to a restaurant on a second visit. But this restaurant is nothing short of divine.
I still dream of the mussels cooked with garlic and Pernod and lemon essence. Everything else left me in a dreamy haze!
Run, don't walk here!",1
5,"Beyond love, beyond adoration, I truly venerate this place. 
When in London, I stop for multiple meals here. That's me in the alcove to the right of the entrance and someday,   I'll probably just take up a fortnight's residence there.
From kidneys, to foie gras, to whatever the special is, food has always been amazing and service attentive.  
The only sad thing, is I walked by this place for years before dining there. When I think of the  delightful meals that could have been, I could cry, but I'm making up for it now. Mea maxima culpa. 
Eschew the high street chain and the mediocre and dine like royalty in a relaxing, unfussy bistro.  Last meal? Dine here! Who needs heaven when you've tasted the food of the Gods.",1
5,"I do not regret choosing Savoir Faire for my birthday dinner, even though it was a complete leap of faith as neither of my friends who accompanied me on the special occasion nor myself had been there before. The place is small and a little quaint, and quirky with the, interesting, wallpapers. It seems really underwhelming upon entrance, but the food we had was truly phenomenal especially considering the prices.
The two-course prix fixe menu was a great find in an otherwise such an expensive city. I had mackerel as an appetizer followed by sea bass. Both were cooked and seasoned really well. We also had a bottle of tempranillo and finished the meal with crème brûlée and lemon tart. It truly felt like fine dining on a shoestring, and we got the best of both worlds. My friends also raved about everything they ordered (caesar salad, lentil moussaka, etc). 
I believe we overheard the servers speak French, which only provided a reassuring sign since there's a better chance the chefs are French as well. The service might be a bit lacking at times - or am I just too used to the American standards - but it doesn't detract at all from the overall value of the restaurant.",1
5,Still at table as I write this. Mussels with garlic sauce presented like escargots was perfectly garlicky. Fig appetizer was excellent. Chicken was lovely. Duck breast was spectacular!  Love this place. Oh and the music playing is perfect.,1
3,"There are pictures of naked ladies all around the restaurant, so I do not recommend bringing your adolescent son here for a meal with his school mates.
The menu is reasonably priced and the wines are, too. There are two levels and the bathroom is so small that it made me have panic attacks. Not really. I'm a man, I can handle that kind of stuff.
But seriously, the sink was so tiny if my hands had a nervous system, they would have panic attacks. Not really. They are a man's hands. Don't get it twisted.",-1
5,"At first it doesn't look like much, but very soon it surprises in a very positive way. The atmosphere is very nice, the staff is friendly and helpful and the food... The food is one of the most delicious I've had in a long time in a restaurant. The meals might not be cheap but they're not expensive either - and for that taste they're worth every penny!",1
5,"Early dinner after the British Museum. Wow! In my 8 year old daughters words, ""They are so nice, and they make very good food."" We had the fried mussels. Like escargot, with mussels, and excellent French bread. For entrees, we had the lamb shank, duck Magritte with chocolate ganache, and bouillabaisse. All were excellent! Dessert was necessary, so we had chocolate mousse and cheesecake, as well as cappuccino. I can heartily recommend everything.",1
5,"Outstanding!  We both had steak and fries with salad and half a bottle of the house red, all of which was delicious.  The cheesecake and crème brulee for dessert were both excellent. the service was impeccable throughout and the whole meal was very good value for money indeed.  I can't rate it too highly.  We'll definitely be back!",1
3,"A cozy restaurant with fresh ingredients with a homecooked touch. I actually felt as if I was sitting in a house being served by my friend's family. The food is good, but waiting almost an hour to have it put in front of you was tough. I had a group lunch and we were on a tight schedule so we promptly ordered at noon hoping to be done before 1PM since we had class. We all ordered different things around the table and were served our appetizers while we waited for main courses. As we were sitting there, I could tell we were getting antsy and constantly checking the time because we knew we were running out and we were going to be late. Not really sure why it took nearly an hour for the food to come out, but I think it's something they should work on for people on a time crunch during lunch time.
When it comes down to the food, it was nice. Not exactly out of this world amazing, but it was definitely a nice light meal. The service was good since we were the only ones in the restaurant, but my only gripe is the long wait for the food to arrive at the table. Maybe I'll be back, but not when I'm in a hurry.",-1
5,"Came across this very nice and cozy place. We made a reservation for dinner. It was sooooooo worth it.
First- The service was very nice and helpful. The food came quick even though there were a lot of people. 
Second- The most important part... the food!! It was excellent. Its French cousine. I got the ceasar salad. It didnt have the ceasar dressing but they had something better, balsamic vinegar dressing. It was delicious. My mom got the escargot. She said it was good. 
 For the main course, i got the beef burger with a mini-salad and fries as a side dish. The patty was cooked to perfection and the fries were not greasy at all.
We also got the cheesecake, and it was good. 
 Overall, I would come back.",1
5,Heaven by way of mussels and lamb shanks. I just stumbled upon this place thanks to yelp. Cozy French casual restaurant in Bloomsbury. Good value for gourmet food and the staff 's really attentive and nice. I will come back!!,1
4,"Great food and drinks at a reasonable price. Service was a bit slow, but other than that would highly recommend!",1
4,"Went for dinner before a show. Surprisingly, there was plenty of availability on a Friday night. The staff was friendly, the 50's French music added to the ambiance, but the food was only slightly above average and the service took a bit too long given our theater time constraints. The best part, though, was the reasonably priced meal.",1
4,"Really good Rillettes, Foie Gras, duck, rib eye, Creme brûlée",1
4,"I thought i'd walked into the wrong restaurant.  Be warned this place is not classy or refined ...its rustic to put it nicely. Further perhaps because it was 5:30pm Tuesday, the place was empty except for 5 senior couples.  This part i didn't mind but a 6th old couple walked in and decided that from the 10 empty tables they wanted to sit next to us ...and then proceeded to stare and eavesdrop for the next 30mts whilst we rapidly finished our meal.
Anyway to backtrack a little, when we sat down were were given 4 menus including the price fix menu, pre-theater menu, al la carte menu and drinks menu.   After consulting yelp and foursquare i decided on the goats cheese and the lambshank and the wife got the sea bass.  The food was excellent and made up for the above shortcomings.  The prices were very good given we were just outside convent garden tourist-ville.  We will definitely go back...but maybe after 7pm next time to try a different vibe!",1
4,"Bijoux is the best way to describe this gem serving hearty food in cozy, slightly eccentric decor. It almost seems a bit out of place on the bustling New Oxford Street, yet step inside and you are miles away from the the noise and chaos of the city. This Bloomsbury neighbourhood favourite is a bit a France in the heart of the city. 
The traditional French bistro menu is simple food cooked very well. And at very reasonable prices! As the locals seem to know. Our mid week supper felt like a feast here.",1
4,"First things first: the food is glorious. It's also reasonably priced, especially considering the quality. 
I had my dinner outside, so I could watch the passersby and enjoy a cigar. The interaction was almost as good as the meal. I was asked for directions and change. Thank goodness the server was well versed in local geography and blessed with patience, as I was essentially useless for all queries, save those regarding my cigar. I was scolded by - I think - a Cuban expatriate for smoking Castro's cigars. Just for the record, it's Honduran. 
The half-carafe of  house wine is better than passable, but not exceptional. The service, while relaxed and non-hurried is friendly and enjoyable. 
I don't post nearly enough recommendations here on Yelp, but here ya go: I recommend Savoir Faire. Oh, and the free wifi is nice. It is, in fact part of the reason you are reading these bon mots. Bon appetite!",1
3,"The food was good, but the service was really slow. 
There were two reasons for this, it was only the second day of one of the servers, and we were one of the two couples that were downstairs, and I think it was a little of out of site, out of mind.",-1
4,"My mother and grandmother were visiting London and I was tasked with finding a place near them for a nice meal on a Friday evening. 
I am pleased to say that Savoir Faire ticked all the boxes we needed for this situation: we needed decent food but not too expensive, with a decent atmosphere but not too loud, walking distance from Russell square, and able to take booking at short notice. We tried a few Italian places near by, but they were not picking up the phone. Their loss, as Savoir Faire allowed us to book online with very little notice; and all four members of our party enjoyed ourselves.
The menus were printed on a couple of sheets of A4, in about as slapdash a fashion as you could muster, and then stapled together. But that didn't detract from the selection of great sounding French dishes. The selection was a little modest, but it did have a ""light menu"" of smaller plates and salads. Ideal for the varied crowd at our table.
From the photos I expected quite small but beautifully executed gourmet French dishes, but in actuality it was more classic cooking at affordable prices. That is no bad thing: I cannot resist a beef bourguignon and this one did not disappoint. Flavoursome beef just melted in the mouth alongside creamy mash and rich sauce. Even the most basic of seasonal vegetables; carrots and broccoli, were lovely. Everyone else seemed very pleased with their lamb shank, chicken salad, and duck breast.
The service was great too; numerous waitresses were very attentive, swift with drinks, and then left us to chatter long after our last course was finished. The freedom to relax and finish drinks after a meal is a real plus on any venue, I absolutely detest being hurried out of the door or hassled for the bill.
The menu as I mentioned was a little on the small side from what I'd expect, but it was by no means bad, and everything we ordered food-wise was excellent. The only real complaint I could give was that the Irish coffee I had afterwards was pretty foul - but I'm not going to get on the back of French restaurant too much for this mistake.
If you like classic French dishes, a good atmosphere in a relatively small place, and a good bite to eat at short notice, you should definitely pop in here.",1
5,"I wouldn't go as far as calling it French, but a interesting menu none the less. 
The menu is printed on a single piece of paper and therefore limited. This was my first time here, but I'm thinking they change it often. Regardless I like small menu's, because - as we proved again this evening - it normally means everything is freshly made
Everything we ordered was fantastic and not to expensive either. You can get away with a 2 course meal for £20",1
5,We enjoyed our dinners between the Caesar salad and French onion soup.  Then we had salmon and beef bourginon that were excellent.   Service was excellent   They gave us time between courses.  We would highly recommend this restaurant.  We came without a reservation and they were very accommodating on a Saturday night,1
5,"Well when the kids like the foie gras you know you're off to a great start!  
Excellent meal--we had the sea bass, steak, chicken and mussels and everyone thought it was yummy. 
Our server even helped avoid a meltdown from our youngest with a quick discussion about drink choices. Well done!
I would highly recommend this place.",1
4,"I've just eaten a fantastic traditional beef bourguignon in this restaurant... It was server with vegetables and ""purée"". Reallly good! I'll come back here asap!",1
5,"Amazing! The baked mussels were incredible, you may need extra bread to soak up all the goodness. The duck with cranberry was cooked perfectly.  The clementine compote was so flavorful and sticky toffee pudding with whiskey creme sauce was the perfect way to end the meal.",1
5,This place is great! service is impeccable and the food is made with precision and care. ordered the liver and beef daube and it was excellent. perfectly cooked and presented. also order the creme brule and choclate mousse. All desserts are made fresh daily!,1
4,"This review covers two different visits:
1- After our exhausting British museum visit one afternoon, my friend and I stumbled upon this tiny restaurant and recalling that it had been packed the previous night we figured it would be a good place for a much needed dose of caffeine and sweets.  At the time we were the only customers there.  Turns out they have the best latte and Banoffee pie in town, and with a French name you'd expect nothing less- except when we got their business card we noticed that the owner is actually Persian!  Classic switcheroo!  Service was also good (by one of the owners I believe).  There we rested like weary travelers of the days of yore, connected to their free wi-fi, snapped a pic or two, and eventually headed out, highly satisfied with our experience.   4 stars
2- We returned a few days later, in the evening this time- hoping that the delicious offering on our previous visit was a prelude to amazing things to come on the dinner front.  We made a reservation and when we showed up the place was packed, which we took as a good sign, but there was an eerie tension in the air - most customers either looked irritated or were actually complaining about something - it looked as if many had been waiting for a really long time for their food to arrive.  This time, our waitress had a bit of an attitude problem, which for a small family run restaurant was a little unusual, but luckily wine came to our rescue, there was no great delay with our food and when it did arrive, while not mind-blowing, was above average.  The place definitely has an 'intimate' setting, not necessarily in the romantic sense- well perhaps that too- but it definitely feels cramped when busy, so be prepared to get fairly up close and personal with your neighbour.  As a result, it doesn't score highly for me on the comfort front.  3 stars
p.s.  nowhere is this size inconvenience more... ummm... inconvenient, than the shockingly small bathroom - absolutely horrible- it's midget sized I tell ya!  Avoid a call of nature at all costs - or perhaps try it to fully appreciate my horror!  
Overall 3.5 stars but since we can't do halves, I'll round it up to 4.",1
4,"Savoir Faire is a great value French restaurant that remains competitive, despite the emergence of superior alternatives elsewhere. I've been here three times now for my work's Christmas lunch over the years (including 2013) and have been happy each time. 
Savoir Faire's chief strength is its impressive value and quality for the prices charged. Sure, it's been overhauled by Le Mercury on Upper Street, but it's nevertheless much better than most restaurants in its price range. Meat is tender, vegetables well-cooked and desserts satisfying. Service is friendly and accommodating, to the point of allowing us to this year stay a little longer to indulge in some post-lunch quiz action.
Here's to Christmas 2014!",1
4,"Completely unfancy in setting and presentation, but delicious and lush in taste! The menu is amusing in that it's 2 photocopied papers stapled back-to-back. Odd to say the least. The dishes are offered as a set menu or with a few a la carte offerings.
The food was just yummy. The rest of my group had hot dishes, but I went for the unique sounding chicken salad. It was the nicest salad I think I've ever had! So many fresh and well-prepared ingredients and beautifully char-grilled chicken to top. The creme brulee wasn't the best ever, but it was tasty (and I can rarely resist a creme brulee)!  My husband had the beef bourguignon and raved about it. 
A quirky little place, but one I would be more than happy to visit again!",1
5,"Loved it.  Thought the food was completely reasonably priced for the quality of the meal!  Also, was nice to have a break from fried food or Italian.  
It was a comfortable place to eat, and was in high demand.  Make a reservation!!",1
3,"After reading all the great reviews about this restaurant we decided to give it a go recently. Overall an ok experience, but nothing really that stood out, hence we probably won't be going back.
So to the details... As we arrived we were seated downstairs and the whole area smells of a cellar or a damp basement, which isn't very pleasant but you quickly get used to it. One of the reviewers mentioned images of 'naked ladies' plastering the walls, which we've seen none of - a bit disappointing:)
The service was very friendly and attentive, but the food took forever to arrive, so make sure that you allocate plenty of time if you decide to visit. We ordered a french wine (unfortunately I don't remember the name of it), which was recommended as 'owners favourite' and it was in fact quite nice and affordable.
The dishes are quite big, so even the most demanding stomachs shouldn't be left disappointed, while those with smaller tummies make sure to NOT eat the bread that's brought in at the start, I know it's fresh, with a crunchy crust and tasty, but otherwise you won't be able to finish your dishes:) 
I had lamb following recommendations of numerous reviewers and my wife had duck. Both dishes were quite nice, but they were very much like home-cooked food I haven't felt anything exquisite about them.
So to sum up, the service is great, food takes a while to arrive, the dishes are more like home-cooked rather than French exquisite cuisine.",-1
5,Wonderful lunch after a visit to the British Museum.  Reasonable prices and delicious. Very kind people and accommodating to my children. Eat here!,1
5,"Was looking for somewhere near the British Museum to get an early dinner, and came here because it had so many good reviews on Yelp. Thanks, Yelp.
The prices are very reasonable for central London and the food was great, with generous portions (I went for the mussels and then the steak, two courses for £21). Add what turned out to be a very nice bottle of wine for £20 and it was about £70 for the two of us. We ended up staying much longer than planned, and never got the feeling we were being chivvied out of the place. I'd definitely go back here if I was in town, and I'd recommend it to others too.",1
5,We were in London for  week and staying in a hotel near the British museum. There were not a lot of choices for dinner within walking distance so we searched YELP for help and found this one. It was just down the street from the museum so we called to book a table and they had one for us.. We strolled over and were promptly seated at a charming table by the window. It was a relaxing atmosphere and the owners were wonderful hosts making sure we were well taken care of. I had the pork belly for dinner and it was beautifully crisp on the outside and succulent on the inside. Yum! The best meal during our stay.,1
5,"We had lunch here after a visit to the British Museum.  We are foodies who have visited Paris, and the fare here is delicious.  We enjoyed the Roast Beef and Brie sandwich, the roasted Chicken with Avocado and Tarragon Aioli sandwich, and the Chicken Caesar Salad.  All three were delicious, as was our Crème Brulee and Mousse au Chocolat for dessert.  House white wine was quite good.  Prices were very reasonable for a London restaurant.  Highly recommended.",1
5,"Yelpers. you did not steer me wrong!! Honestly, I am so happy with this place and this is coming from someone who normally isnt a huge fan of french food.  
a) Service:  We came in on a Saturday night with no reservations and were greeted with a friendly smile by a lovely lady.  She sat us within 5 minutes and actually moved our seats around to make us more comfortable.
b) Environment: This place is super cute without being pretentious with smaller tables, which I like so you can actually have a good private conversation. 
c) Food: Exceptional.  You can find as healthy or unhealthy food as you want, with lighter food options ranging from salads and bouillabaise (which incidentally I ordered), to proper  two and three course meals. I know it silly, but we actually  had warm crusty bread, which is one of my favorite things, and they DIDNT charge us -- SHOCKING!!  My husband had the baked goat cheese and tapenade and steak as a main.  My friend had the goose rillette with duck magret.  Everyone gobbled down their meals happily.  We had a carafe of the house red and followed by courvoisier and creme brulee, which I have to say delicious. 
d) Value:  All of the above was around 90 pounds. What a great deal for a VERY expensive city :)  
I will absolutely be here again with a delicious gourmet meal with beautiful presentation without the price tag.",1
3,"OK, but I really didn't understand the 5 star reviews for this place. Oddly decorated, slow service and very English French food... Meh",-1
4,"Located in the heart of London's theatre district, Savoir Faire stands out for its warm and friendly atmosphere. A nice change from the abundance of large chains in London. The quirky decor is charming. I especially liked the ceiling. The food is delicious, and you can't complain about the portions. They are huge! The lamb shank was succulent with a delicious sauce, while my partner loved the rillette starter. I would recommend you go.",1
4,"French dining at its best.  The ambiance is casual and laid back, the food is fantastic and the service is great.  This is a must visit and easy to get to (especially after a visit to the British museum) I had one of the beef plates which was delicious. Their set menu is excellent value. The only thing is that it can feel a bit crowded and then around 9 ish the downstairs can get empty and you feel like it is midnight, so try to get a table upstairs.",1
4,The food tasted homemade and delishous. We sat by the window which was nice - you could watch the street and the people outside. For me the atmosphere was quite right - this place is 20 years old and has been in private hands - a good sign with so many chains and cooperations popping up in this neighbourhood. Service was very friendly and good. I can totally recommend this place and would go back - maybe even will on my next visit in London.,1
5,"Two thing I remember was their lamb and mussel served in escargot pan.
They were so good.
The service was good. 
Food was good and not pricy.
Service was fast.
Bread they served was yummy.
Overall it was great experience and I am so glad I picked this place.
If I ever go back to London, yes I want to go back:)",1
5,Very nice and cost atmosphere with very good service. Had the lamb and it was very good. A place I will go back.,1
4,"Service was welcoming, helpful and prompt. As they suggest on their website, their emphasis is on value and quality. This is honest cooking from honest ingredients and served well, and it is not a fancy place. I mean to compliment them by saying their food was like ""grandma's good Sunday cooking"". We each had goose rilletes, then Burgundian beef stew and lamb shank both with creamy mashed potatoes, carrots and broccoli. The wine we selected was adequate, and priced well. The ambience is humble but clean and quiet enough to converse. Overall very satisfied.",1
5,Came here for lunch after the day spent at the British Museum. The food is SPECTACULAR.  The service attentive without being hurried. The wait staff gladly made recommendations for wine that suited a variety of tastes.  The meal...from starter to coffee for dessert was spectacular!  I had the bouillabaisse and my daughter had the lamb shank.  We had goat cheese starter and split a bottle of the French pinot noir.  Will definitely try and return during our stay in London.,1
5,"We just finished a dinner at Savoir Faire and had a great time! It's tiny,completely authentic and the food is well cooked. We had the beef bourguignon which was amazing. Rosted bell peper soup was interesting but wouldn't order it again. Small place and super cozy for a wintery evening.",1
5,"If you're looking
for a better restaurant with the same pricing but better customer service and
food come to Savoir Faire, hopefully you are fortunate and have a better
experience and itis all worth visiting. The
ambiance is nice and you should come if you like looking adifferent French
places.The prices here are very reasonable and the food was great! The food is
always top of the lineand in affordable prices.",1
4,"We ended up stopping in here compliments of the Yelp app, which seldom steers us wrong. I'm glad we listened. It was affordable and delicious and the atmosphere was adorable. We felt comfortable just hanging out for a long while and enjoying a leisurely Sunday meal with friends. 
I had high hopes for the fried goat's cheese. It was good, but I'd give it a pass next time. Also, two people at the table ordered ceasar salads and said they tasted oddly salty. Other than those complaints, everything at the table got rave reviews from starters to mains and desserts. And the wine! Delicious. 
For location, good food, and price point, it's definitely a gem that we'd go back to anytime.",1
5,"This place sits on the corner of a narrow but busy London three-street intersection. If you possibly can, get a seat on the street level floor in front of the picture window that looks out on that intersection, which it seems like all of London crosses thru.. It's like sitting in front of a wall-high diorama, one that always changes, with big red double-deckers rumbling thru one second, then taxi-cabs in the opposite direction the next, then more vehicles coming at you from the street opposite your corner and curving away the next, and then these bicyclist commuters pumping fearlessly away alongside these guys in this very narrow space.. and then pedestrians scurrying past you on the sidewalk..
Hey Yelp.. you led us right! Based on Yelp reviews, we dropped in here after exhausting ourselves with an afternoon in the British Museum. Like what everyone else says, it was a treat.. the *best* meal we had during our vacation (but.. well.. not that much competition really.. people are not kidding when they complain about British cuisine), reasonable prices (because we dropped in early, around 6 they gave us a special, lower-priced ""Pre-show"" menu, I guess with smaller portions and one course options that suited us just fine). Enjoyed our meal and wine and just sitting in front of that damn fine window looking at the world come and go so much we ended up ordering dessert and coffee.. just to stay a little longer.",1
5,"Felt like a bit of Paris dropped in the middle of London. We were looking for an authentic French meal and found it at Savoir Faire. The service was excellent, food selection to our liking. The prices were reasonable and we were able to get a reservation quickly.  The house wine went well with the meal. I will return to this restaurant during my next visit to London.",1
5,"We visited Savoir Faire recently, while staying in London and it was a wonderful experience. The prices are quite reasonable, whether you order from the pre-theatre or la carte menu. We started with salads and tomato soup, and continued with sirloin steak and salmon.  Everything was perfectly prepared, nicely presented. Dessert was chocolate mousse, and the lightest cheesecake I have ever tasted! Even the coffee was perfect. For us, it was a great way to cap off a vacation.",1
5,"Just outside the much more expensive theatre district, this family-run little eaterie is a delight. My wife and I come here quite frequently for special occasions. 
The service is friendly but unobtrusive; the food is simply gorgeous (not too much and not too little--so you can just about squeeze in three courses); the house red (available in 4 carafe sizes) is eminently quaffable; and the proprietor, an ex-airline pilot, is friendly and attentive. It is the perfect place to sit and eat and talk as you watch the traffic go by on a rainy evening.
The mussels are always worth having; last time we tried something different though, and the asparagus starter was amazing. The steak entrecôte is great.",1
5,"Amazing food. Amazing service. I made a reservation for here for my birthday with several guests and they were incredibly accommodating to my unknown exact number of guests and need to pre-order so we could get in & out in 1 hr to make at 7:30 show. They also had great wine recommendations and delicious, interesting food.",1
3,"Cute bistro on New Oxford Street with a great value dinner menu (just under £20 for two courses, £15.50 for an entrecote steak, frites and sald).  The interior is pretty quirky and it definitely exudes that family-run feeling that few places in London possess these days.
I went for the entrecote option (rare) - I thought it was ok, although noticeably tough.  The flavour was decent though, and the chips were good.  However, whilst eating, I just couldn't help but think of Le Mercury in Angel which has a similar MO and is simply fantastic (and cheaper).  However, I will return here at some point and try some of the other dishes on the menu as I'm aware that the entrecote item may not be treated with the same respect as the other dishes.  Update forthcoming...",-1
5,"Euh, zis is simply my canteen when I am in London. As good as home. Ok nearly as good as home (in case my wife reads this), always better than if it's me cooking at home. You can't go wrong with the Boeuf Bourguignon or the Lamb Shank. Zey've added a fig appetiser which is worth trying. Every dish is tastefully executed and presented. Deserts not quite as good but if in addition zey had a patisserie chef zey'd have to raise ze price, so happy to keep it as it is. Done my best to make it clear zis review is coming from a Frenchman...",1
4,We were at British museum and we were looking for a place to eat. We notice there was Pret A Manger everywhere but we wanted something unique in London. Luckily yelpers recommend this place La Bistro Savoir Faire because it turned out to be a hidden gem. The curb appeal definitely does not represent the food they serve. To be honest I probably wouldn't eat at this restaurant without the yelp reviews. Their menu is very simple. The guys had the delicious burger with fries which was huge and cooked just right. The girls had lasagna that came with the best seafood soup. If only I had the recipe! I was told London doesn't have good food but Savoir Faire was delicious.,1
5,Had dessert here twice while visiting London. Best lemon tart!,1
4,"Had a really nice dinner there.
The service was very friendly and attentive. My only gripe is that the French style of steak is thin and slightly tough compared with the meat in the US. But the sauce it was served with tasted great.",1
5,"So we were at the British Museum and looked at Yelp for something close and this place had 4 stars with 90 reviews so we went and boy are we glad we did.  The foie gras was top notch and for dinner the beef borgunone (spell check does not work) was perfect with the fat rendered just right.  The duck was probably great for a non duck conniseure, but it is one of my favorite dishes so i judge harshly if not exactly right.  Overall the writing on the ceiling is entertaining and the atmosphere is laid back and comfortable, the staff were very polite and as you can see our experience is rated 5 stars.
I definitely suggest trying this place, if we are in the area and in the mood for French we will be back, most likely the next time we are at the museum.",1
3,"Perhaps one of the worst things about Yelp is the expectations. I was expecting a lot out of this place from all the reviews, so I brought my sister here. I can't seem to remember what she ordered, but I had the escargot and a lamb dish. Both were decent, but were really not that great. The lamb was too chewy and the escargot was also lacking some hit-the-spot Frenchy goodness. 
Nonetheless, it is nicely located in central London and has a nice restaurant setting. I guess you could give it a try if you're itchin' for French food within the area, but personally, I wouldn't itch to go back here again.
I also might want to add how funny it was when my (also American) sister asked for a glass of iced tea. The response she received was a facial expression which read ""what the hell? ICED tea?!,"" which obviously came from the English waitress who couldn't understand why on earth one would want their tea ICE COLD. The lack of frigidity to my drinks was definitely something I had to get used to whilst living in London :)",-1
5,"We went there on the very strong recommendation from our hotel as ""the place to go"" before heading off to the theater. How right they were.
First, the food. It was superbly prepared using obviously fresh ingrediants. Presentation was very nicely done. This is not some big chain establishment with a million things on the menu but a small, family run place that has a selection that is both authentic and just plain delicious. 
As mentioned, the restaurant is not some huge chain so reservations are in order. We had a small table with a setting that my wife and I would call romantic. This is the kind of place you go if you want an authentic bistro experience. We might not have gone in had we not known about it from the hotel but there is a reason they have a steady stream of regulars.
As for the people, our service was top notch and very attentive. Max, the owner, spent time chatting with us. Leaving aside that he is fascinating in his own right, that he visited with us is and wanted to make sure they were meeting our expectations, which they far exceeded, is a reflection of how we found everyone there to be. Our server was especially helpful for our dinner selections and she was very attentive during the evening.
I think it simple to sum up our experience. If you want a large chain menu and food, don't go here. If you want superb food with obviously hand picked fresh ingredients and expertly prepared dishes, don't go anywhere else. Max is terrific, the staff is terrific and our total experience was simply perfect. This unmistakably is a gem.",1
5,Wonderful!  This place is pretty ideal for a romantic dinner for two.  The food is always top-notch while the prices aren't crazy.  The service can be a bit smug occasion but if you feel like a nice long dinner with lots of wine then this is a great place to go.,1
4,"We ate a lovely meal here on a Sunday evening. The food was delicious and original. The service, contrary to some other reviews, was prompt. I suspect that we were served by one of the owners, who was charming. In London, at this price, a gem.",1
3,"Hmm, maybe I ordered the wrong thing. The chicken, Pimms, and the staff were fine, maybe I was a little too American or something. The upstairs was very pleasant, and the downstairs looked like a cool place to hang out if you had a large group. Had some Pernod because it felt like the right thing to do. Will def go back but not really in a hurry. Booking via the OpenTable widget above was lovely.",-1
4,"Savoir Fair is a good place to eat if you are near the British Museum.  The atmosphere is OK but dated with red plastic tablecloths and stark un-curtained windows.  The food is good and the prices are very reasonable for London.  A nice wine list but the house wine by the glass or carafe was very drinkable.  A choice of a two or three course meal was made easy for me.  Good starters, solid entree and some great desserts.  They had the best (strongest) coffee I had in 
London.at
 a restaurant.  I would go back again",1
4,"There's an honesty about this French restaurant that is instantly noticed upon entering the tightly packed dining space. You'll be warmly welcomed, but without the sickly sweet cloying of some restaurants. Service is matter of fact and polite by staff who are obviously comfortable within the relaxed atmosphere. I can only speak for one dish on the menu, a dish that shall not be forgotten any time soon, the beef bourguignon. Truely a comforting experience, Heartily recommended.",1
4,"Dessert is great, meals are cheaper in lunch time.",1
5,"Unbelievably delicious appetizer and entree (I had duck as an entree), but the lime dessert pie was not good at all. Disregarding the dessert, the restaurant is lovely, service is amazing and multilingual, and food is delicious!",1
2,"Check your bill carefully, and count your change!   Came on at 17:30, had a nice meal, and obviously had to get going for a show, I had my cash out.  Gave us a bill that was 11£ to much, over charge was on a glass of wine.   Could have been a simple error but three servers were hunched over the area where my bill was being prepared.  There were only three tables of diners in the place.",-1
4,"A sweet little French bistro in the heart of London offering a la carte and 2-course dinners. The foie gras was great, the duck succulent, and for dessert, sticky toffee pudding (not so French, but that's the beauty of being in London). Everything was reasonably priced, especially the house wine. My only complaint is that the pudding was a little dry.",1
5,"If you're looking for lovely gourmet French cuisine in a romantic little restaurant oozing with character, look no further than this surprisingly affordable central London gem.  I've been there three times now - it's a favourite romantic dinner date for my boyfriend and me - and will go there many more times, whenever I can come up with a good excuse!  One of the things I love the most is that even though the food is excellent and French, the atmosphere manages to be romantic without being pretentious.  The waiters keep an eye on you without making you feel like an uncultured heathen.  My biggest problem with it is there are always more things on the menu that I want than I can possibly consume!",1
5,Excellent as always. My 15 year old son ordered a hamburger. Even it was excellent.,1
4,"Great food! Went there with family and we all enjoyed our food. Waitress was nice enough to give us the special even though time was up. It is quite refreshing to eat European portion size. It is a few blocks away from touristic area, so that is another plus.",1
5,Very good place with authentic French cuisine! Highly recommended *****,1
4,Cozy French place with good service and tasty food.,1
5,"Great food, nice service, small bistro and very reasonably priced. Not a fast place to eat, but have a glass of wine while you wait. The pan fried Foie Gras was yummy.",1
4,"Great value!  Offers a 2-course set menu for a little over £20 with lots of variety (starters and mains). I opted out on the starter this time, but the mains on their own are a good deal as well. Had the slow roasted pork belly which was perfectly crispy, meaty and fatty all at the same time, although perhaps a bit too saucy. For desert, split the banoffee pie with a friend - more banana than toffee, but the crust was crumbly and it was a nice way to top off the meal!",1
4,"Excellent little unassuming French place. Got the courgette and aubergine stuffed with small prawns... which was taste perfection. Then I got the pork belly, which was too much food and also the glaze was too sweet. The service was excellent. Good value as well.",1
4,"We had the garlic mussels, goat cheese salad, broccoli soup as starters and they were all good especially the garlic mussels! We then had the lamb shank, fish of the day and sea bass and again they were all delicious. I recommend this place for a good and reasonably priced meal.",1
3,"You know, sometimes where you really look forward to try a place, it really lets you down.  This is what happened with Savoir Faire.
I am not sure whether it was the terrible weather or the fact I just came back from Paris, but I kinda expected bistro food at Parisienne prices and Parisienne quality.  That, unfortunately, Savoir Faire was not.  The price atmosphere and level of service was about right, but the food was a little off the mark.
It was also very slow, and who wants to wait ages for their food on what was perhaps the first real wintery evening of 2009?",-1
4,"What a happy coincidence we found this great place for lunch! Welcoming and warm, food was excellent, served quickly and attentively. Beef Daube and duck leg with lentils; expertly cooked and served very hot. Well done!",1
3,"What with all the five-star reviews of Savoir Faire here on Yelp, I was expecting to be served up a loin of unicorn with a side of fairy-dusted mash.
But it was not to be.  The food I received was thoroughly average.  The wine was potent and flowing, though, and the amount of time between courses was incredibly drawn out (and filled with more wine drinking).  So I wasn't entirely upset by the mediocrity of the meal at the time.  My fig and cheese starter was nothing special, and my fish main was overseasoned but cooked well.  I was too intoxicated by the time my dessert arrived to remember much about it.
In the end, I left with the impression that the courses were actually quite small for the price coupled with the inattentive execution of the dishes.  And I was kind of hungry.",-1
5,"Not far from the hotel I was staying in.  I passed this place a number of times as I wandered around London.  It was not until these glowing reviews on Yelp! that I decided to give it a try.
I had their 2 course special (a steal at ~17 pounds).  I started with their smoked salmon and asparagus starter.  It was beautifully presented and delicious.  I followed it with their rib-eye with Bearnaise.  It came with Potatoes au gratin (which I normally do not like but these were good) and some steamed veggies.
I washed it down with a half liter of their house red wine (also delish).  All in all a very good meal.  One of the best I have had in London.",1
3,"It is a tad unfair to review a French restaurant after spending a week driving around the south of France in a convertible gorging oneself on French food and wine, but that's the situation I find myself in.  One must persevere in such conditions, although I suspect the juxtaposition of eating in the south of France with eating in the middle of the tourist district of London is why my star rating is lower than others'.
Savoir Faire is reasonably priced by London standards; 2 entrees, 2 mains, 1 dessert, and a carafe of house red cost under 50 quid.  I was underwhelmed by the food, however.  I had the beef carpaccio and the lamb shanks, and while both were fine, they weren't exactly screaming with flavor.  My co-eater had a tarte tatin for desert which was the least genuine tarte tatin I have ever seen in my life:  it looked like someone had taken apple sauce and placed it on top of pastry, and then covered the whole lot in custard.  Maybe it was designed for 80 year olds who had lost their teeth and couldn't chew?
There are some pluses though.  The cafe has a nice family feel and it was packed when I went which is always a good thing.  Also the waitresses actually spoke French which meant I could flirt with them in the language of love.  Normally waitresses in London speak Polish which I don't speak and is also the language of sausages, not love.
Overall not bad and if you were going to the theatre and needed a quick dinner beforehand you wouldn't be disappointed.  I don't think I'd take a date here.",-1
4,"Excellent casual French restaurant!  I had the mussels for first course... out of this world!  Then moved to the sea bass entree... very good.  Service was friendly and more proactive than many places in London.  Atmosphere is intimate, yet the floor to ceiling windows around the entire front makes it feel like you are sitting on the street in this busy part of London.",1
5,"Yelp, you are my new best friend.  This place is so unbelievably well-priced given its location and the quality of food they serve.  Actually, it's unbelievably well-priced even if it wasn't right in Central London.  There's really not much to say other than that Savoir Faire serves tasty, authentic French food without the fouf and the miserable service.
My husband and I each had a delicious starter and a main, and we were so pleased with our two-course dinner that we added dessert.  We asked our (very friendly) server for suggestions, and were thrilled with her recommendations: a delicious mango and basil sorbet, and the bannoffee pie, complete with a crumbly digestive biscuit crust.  Heaven on a plate.
We will be back.  We will be bringing our friends back.  But please, don't tell too many other people about Savoir Faire, because I want to be able to get a table next time I am craving their lamb shank.",1
3,"Well Savoir Faire...you were a bit of a letdown. Not in a ""Oh my gosh, I am going to see that Blair Witch Project film, it looks great!"" way. More like ""The last Family Guy season wasn't as funny as the others, was it?"" 
The food was pretty good, but not up to what I had heard it could be. Although tasty enough, steaks were stringy and fatty. That lost a star from the review right there! I also felt that starters were lacking in portion size. Overall though, I did really enjoy myself, but that was probably due to the stellar company I was in! 
The ambience was pretty good in the restaurant, but décor was a little rough in places. Service was pretty slow and inattentive, but to be fair, this was possibly because we were tucked out of the way in the basement, like a pack of grouchy live-in mother-in-laws. 
All in all, I had a wonderful night, but that standard of Savoir Faire is more comparable to some of the 'Red Café' establishments around town, as opposed to being a newly discovered gem for me.",-1
4,"The food was DELICIOUS!!!! really really tasty.
between the three of us we had the fried goatcheese with stewed apples, the pumpkin soup (which was spicy and just perfect for the cool weather), the gnochi with sundried tomatoes and melted cheese, and a pumpkin/goat cheese salad where there were very hefty helpings of goat cheese. The ceasar salad was a staple and the stewed beef with mashed potatoes was perfectly savory. i LOVED!!!
we got one bottle of wine for about 17 quid, and entire dinner cost about 65 quid (tip included) so really affordable and delivers great taste for the cash.
The lowdown
- there are two floors for dining: ground level and lower level. the restaurant is situated on a corner, so on the ground level you can do good people watching and have access to the bar. Lower level is cozy, dare I say romantic and the walls are adorned with oil murals of tasteful nudity and big mirrors here and there. 
- the bathrooms are cavernous and are truly tiny, but cute. To enter the women's restrooms there are literally 3 different doors. The only time i felt claustrophobic was in there.
- there is NO music in the background. I didn't like that, and that is part of the reason why i took the 5th star out .
- the crowd is diverse in terms of age, so don't expect to go there and find collegiates in mini skirts, but rather groups of people wanting to have a laid back conversation and a good time without having any use for background encouragement. 
- I suggest you go with your partner for a quiet night out, or with parents. not the place to go for loud fun.
FOOD delicious!!! i will go back : ))",1
5,"Where do I even begin to describe this fantastic meal? 
Maybe it was the fact that we had a 2 course meal for only £16.90? 
Maybe it was the fact that they had a half carafe of the house wine for £8.00?
Maybe it was because the food was so god damn tasty!?!!!?
This place is adorable, it seems small at first, but there is a whole other floor in the basement. It's the type of place where you could sit with a glass of wine outside with a good book, and just stay there all day. Or it's a place where you can enjoy a fabulously good meal.
Joe and I opted for the 2 course meal. I went with a goat cheese appetizer that was absolutely fantastic! For my meal I went with the pork belly plate and holy crap, it was some of the best stuff I have ever had in my life. With some mashed potatoes and apple sauce compote, my mouth is watering just thinking about that fantastic meal. Sopped it up with some soft french bread, this meal was definitely a highlight of the whole trip.
For dessert Joe and I shared the lemon tart. Again, just awesome. Perfect mesh of sour and sweet, with a little bit of crunch from the crust.
This meal was an absolute STEAL, with the amount of food we got and the overall tastiness, when I'm back in London I'm coming back here, and so should you.",1
5,"Beautiful.
It's difficult to go back to eating regular, everyday food after dining here. Perhaps my meal was laced with crack and I need another hit. Seriously, I could develop a habit off their mussel starter, and I don't even like seafood that much, but it was so perfectly flavored. Dip the bread into the remaining pesto from the mussels and I guarantee there's nothing better. Ambiance was lovely as well, I enjoyed the quotes written on the ceiling; they could be great conversation starters on a first date.",1
5,"I love Yelp. And I love it even more for directing me to the wonderful and divine Savoir Faire. This restaurant is like a breath of fresh country-air in the centre of a busy, bustling and let's be honest, slightly dirty city. Family owned and family run, this is a great slice of rustic French cuisine. 
I went here with a group of nine on a Friday night. Our table was ready, our waitress was superb and we were made to feel really welcome. The wine list was a hit with my partner (the aspiring amateur sommelier) and we kicked off the evening with a lovely Riesling from Alsace, called Rifile. This was so good (not too sweet, and perfectly balanced), and I even went to my parents local wine cavern Byrne's of Clitheroe, to find some more bottles of the stuff. Fab. 
I went for the foie gras - wonderfully rich and perfectly matched with the apple and brioche. For my main I went for the Sea Bass which was again, exquisitely cooked and the tomato and pepper sauce delicate and flavoursome. Between nine of us we hit most of the items on the 2 courses for £16 deal. Bargain. Other highlights included the salmon gateaux and the rich duck dish. Yum. We were so relaxed we even took in some desserts and coffee. My friend even venturing to try some grappa!!!
I did also venture into the small private dining area as I was intrigued by the murals. Now, I thought from previous reviews that the murals were hand painted BY Lautrec, now I'm no Art Historian, but they looked pretty new to be around 100 years old. So, I think they're probably a copy and homage at best. Still pretty though!
Quite simply, Savoir Faire is great, fab and brilliant all at the same time. A perfect place to chill with friends whilst sampling some top notch French food. This isn't haute cuisine, but all portions are generous, tasty and definitely value for money. I'll be back in a flash, as soon as I persuade some more friends to go, judging by their emails the next day about how fab the food was, I don't think it will be long.",1
4,"This is a special place to take your loved one for a romantic meal. The restaurant is a family run business and you can tell by the care that is put into both service and food. The decor is also lovely with an ambiance that makes me feel within the renaissance era. The food is fantastic and quite authentically French. What is surprising is the price. For what is one of the better dining experiences in London, this restaurant is very affordable. At under £20 for a main meal this is excellent value.
I hear there are secret tunnels within the restaurant that you can dine in for a really exclusive feel. I will be back again to try this out.",1
5,"I adore this place. I've been several times, and have never been disappointed.
My first time there was with a group of 6 on a Friday night--we had no reservations and the entire lower ground floor was reserved for a party of 40. Rather than shoo us out, the friendly (understandably flustered) wait staff seated us in a cavern-like room behind the curtain, under the stairs. (My friends and I affectionately refer to this room as the lair.)   Because it was such a busy night, the kitchen was a bit slow, but we were kept happy with the well-priced (not so bad) carafes of house red (their old-fashioned pimms is also mixed quite well). 
The food was (later I found out, always is) amazing--the lamb dishes and goat cheese appetizers are my favorites, and the desserts were wonderful (and good for sharing).   After we were finished, the waitresses (probably exhausted), let us sit for as long as we wanted to finish our wine. 
I would recommend this place to anyone--for a group, a date, or even by yourself because it's that freaking good.",1
5,"Whoa there - 5 stars, are you sure?
Fantastic setting - check
Great service - check
Mouth watering food - check
Reasonably priced - check
Left venue with a high alcohol blood level - check
Seriously tasty food, all French themed and beautifully cooked. A little too central for my liking but that's only because I want it in my hood. Bum!",1
3,"This place evoked so many feelings in me, some contradictory.
Apprehension. One of the first places where i decided to go solely based on yelp reviews (and i had 3 vegetarian friends with me)
Elation. The food was so good ... so tasty. I loved the foie gras ... and the steak ... yumm :)
Wonder. I am used to French food in London being pretty expensive. It came to be 21 quids per head ... very very reasonable.
Disappointment. This is a very veg-unfriendly place. There was only one vegetarian option among the main course ... gnocchi. My friends didn't like it and they ended up having a horrible dinner, made worse by the fact that i enjoyed my share of the food. So i ended up having to pay for all of them :(
So this turns out to be one of those restaurants where i would like to come often but i won't be able to since i can't bring my friends along. But maybe someday when i am all alone ...",-1
5,"Exceptional value, and great food.  The Goose Rillettes entree was particularly delicious, but all dishes were prepared thoughtfully and of high quality.  It's a small place so reservations are a must.",1
5,"Sacrebleu! Savoir Faire is more French than a baguette french kissing a croissant over a bottle of Bordeaux.
And I'm not talking Walt Disne-fied French. (Let's just say that the singing candelabras named Lumiere and the les poissons loving chefs were absent from the experience.)
Humble and unpretentious, Savoir Faire has been one of my favourite London dining experiences to date. Not because of fancy views or exquisite menus, but because these folks are living their dream and doing it authentically -- and that is beyond admirable. 
Savoir Faire is not a chain nor a franchise, but rather a 10-year old family run restaurant.  It was so family run that when I called for a reservation, I had to spell out the words ""E-i-g-h-t P-M"" so the French speaking host could decipher my American accent. 
Each table gets a basket of freshly baked bread, every menu item is made 100% in house, and they source only the best-wines-for the-money. In fact, the entire experience was quite affordable -- a two course meal for £16 seemed like stealing.
On that note, I stole the grilled mushroom with melted mozzarella and roasted pepper AND the Nile perch with roasted garlic and lime beurre blanc. Others indulged in grilled mussels, pan fried foie gras, lacquered duck magret, treacle-glazed pork belly, wild boar and mushroom terrine ... it's agonizing typing this out because it makes me want to turn around and go right back. 
Really, the experience was perfect. Quaint, unpretentious, delicious, affordable -- and to give credit where credit is due: all thanks to Tom E's talk thread suggestion!  ;) God, I love Yelp! Especially when it allows me to find hidden gems like Savoir Faire.",1
4,"Great food, and the set menu prices were really decent. The waitress even helped us find the cheapest combination for everyone to get what they wanted.",1
5,"I'm sad to say that my romance with Yelp has been on the rocks recently. Don't get me wrong, she treats me right- it's me that has been the lazy one not putting the effort into our relationship. She give, give ,gives, telling me where all the best restaurants are and tracking my favourite reviewers. Like an ever faithful lover, she's always there when I walk in through the door at the end of the day, tired and emotional with no energy to type. And what do I do in return? Skim the cream of the crop for reviews before sneaking off to...watch TV! 
Well I'm a changed woman now. Savoir Faire has made me see the error of my ways. A restaurant this good needs to be Yelped with tender love and respect. Finding places like this is what made me fall for Yelp so hard in the first place and, it made me realise, I know we're meant to be together, through the good times and the bad...
So anyway, to the restaurant. Where to start? With the food? The incredible sweet cinnamon glazed duck breast with an oh so tiny cube of dauphinoise? Or the phenomenal (and pungent) mussels floating in garlic butter?
Or maybe you'll get a better sense of Savoir Faire if I tell you about the wine. Our fruity Rioja was the hussy of vinos. She went with all of us, snogging us hard before leaving us desperate for more. For the second time in this review- I was in love (so I wear my heart on my sleeve!).
If I've left you in any doubt, Savoir Faire is an amazing restaurant. Everything about the place is as French as you could imagine, from the staff to the decor. Stunning Lautrec murals are painted across the walls in the back room and baskets of home made bread arrive at the tables with the minimum of fuss. The prices here are incredible too. Two courses of tasty, tasty French fare cost only £16 and I am in no doubt that it was worth every penny. 
After this rambling review all that's left for me to say is Yelp, I'm sorry. I'll never take you for granted again.",1
5,"Savoir Faire, C'est magnifique!  This cafe deserves high marks. Well-priced, food is anything but typical.  Great wines, unsnobby
atmosphere, lovely private dining with murals of Henri de Toulouse- Lauterac. 
I love family run business. Which gives you the special feeling of being part of their family. And to sharing their piece of love to you. 
Entrecote steaks, is known as rib steak. My favorite steak is their
best Australian rump steak.  Everything is the menu is worth trying. Be adventurous!! 
Reservations is recommended for large groups.",1
5,"After telling as many of my friends as possible about Savoir Faire, I still don't know why most people have never heard if it.
It's a small ground floor French restaurant with a dungeon-like cellar perfect for groups. The cellar consists of the entrances to several former smuggling tunnels dug to take moonshine and stuff into Soho from outside the old city limits. These tunnels are mostly blocked now but the entrances make for wondereful private dining alcoves and each has been fitted with a large table and candlelight. If you are thinking of somewhere good to dine with a big group, then think no more - a private tunnel table at Savoir Faire is ideal.
Did I mention yet that the walls of some of the alcoves are painted with murals by Toulouse Lautrec?
Or how about that George Orwell used to come here to write his weekly Observer column?
On top of that location and history stuff, it's also an enjoyable meal. French food in London can run so ridiculously expensive for tiny portions with an astronomical wine list and snotty waiters - not here. The food is well-priced French classics, hearty yet elegant, the wine is carafe-served and affordable and the staff seem to be a decent bunch. It's like they want to break every stereotype for french restaurants.
The final bonus of this great find is that it's right close to The End and is a great place to start a big night out with friends.",1
4,Found on Yelp and were not disappointed.  So close to British Museum that this makes the perfect stop for a lovely and not touristy dinner.  We had made reservations on line that were honored and service was great. We were able to enjoy good wine have a delicious French dinner and make our play on time!  Very reasonable for London.  You will love this charming spot!,1
4,"3.8 maybe?
Thought I'd go here for my last meal before departing London, considering all the amazing reviews.  Came with a group of 7, they seated us in a very tiny and adorable underground cove area that was secluded from the rest of the restaurant.
Here's the breakdown:
Atmosphere: 5
The place is adorable, service is great, and when you're there, it almost feels as if you're not in London anymore, but a quaint restaurant off an alley somewhere in a French town.
Value: 5
The prix-fixed 2-course menu for 16.50 is amazing in terms of the variety that they provide for you for both courses -- appetizers ranging from asparagus salad to gazpacho to steak carpaccio to mussels and goat cheese; mains from braised lamb to duck with red wine sauce/chocolate to beef bourguinon to perch (our party ordered all of these, btw).
Food: 3.5
For what you pay for, this place is definitely worth it. In terms of the food alone, however, I wasn't all that impressed. The menu sounded promising, but I was actually disappointed with how the food turned out -- not that it was bad, it was just average to good at best -- not quite up there with the consistent 5-star reviews. My steak carpaccio was seared far too much; the sauces for the duck and the lamb tasted the same to me, the duck had too much fat and not enough crisp. Everything else was fine, but not spectacular.
Bottom line -- I like it, and it's definitely worth checking out, but doesn't quite go up there with my favorite places to eat in London.",1
4,"When I'm in London, I spend a lot of time at the British Museum and I'm voraciously hungry on the conclusion of my visits.  I avoid any other eating establishment on the perimeter of the museum grounds and eagerly make the short walk to Savoir Faire because their delicious fresh food, in an environment that is very cozy and soothing, revives the stomach and the soul.",1
5,"On a Sunday afternoon when many french restaurants are getting thin Savoir Faire shined. I found and went here based on a couple very favorable Yelp! reviews and was not disappointed. Wonderful, unpretentious ambiance and a delightful original menu. I had a smoked fish chowder full of flavor to start and a butternut squash risotto that was wonderful. An off the menu tarte tartin closed. R. had soup and then then a very nicely done sea bass. Kids were delighted with omelette du fromage and burger & frites.  The wine menu did present a bit more of a challenge than I would have expected with too many single grape new world wines but we were happy with our french bordeaux, young but a nice light taste that fit our fish and risotto. This could well turn into a sunday afternoon fav, especially at the price.",1
3,"We enjoyed our meal here at 6 pm on a Monday night.  My husband ordered from the pre-theatre/lunch menu and i went for the regular dinner prix fixe. The menu had some interesting and unusual items that would not be found at a chain restaurant.  Our starters were lamb kidneys in mustard sauce and mussels prepared like snails.   I didn't really like the latter more than the usual types of mussel dishes but enjoyed the novel approach.  My husband was happy with his bouillabaisse.  My lamb shanks were very tender.  The tarte tartin was less tasty than others I have had, with a rather soggy bottom crust.  Overall it was a good experience with attentive service and reasonable prices.  I would give it a 3.5 ratting if I could. Maybe it even deserves 4 stars, not sure.",-1
2,"My wife and I went to Savoir Faire on the basis of the 4.5 star Yelp rating. Thinking we were in a cosmopolitan city like London, the rating meant a lot to us in selecting the restaurant.  We were very disappointed.
We started with the mussels which were grilled and then served with a pernod butter garlic sauce.  The mussels were the best of the dinner and we rated them a 7 on a 10 point scale.  Things went down hill quickly from there.
The second course was the warm goat cheese and fig salad on arugula (""rocket"") bed.  It was mediocre, despite our high expectations.  It could have had more arugula which would have added to the experience, and fresher  rather than wilted.
The third (main course) was the Entrocote Steak Frites.  We ordered it medium rare.  It was cooked to the right temperature, but the steak was as tough as shoe leather, despite the chef pounding it for a long time before cooking it.  The french fries were okay.
For dessert, we had Vanoffee which was a pie with toffee and banana and whipped cream on a graham cracker shell.  It was good but not spectacular.
The service was pretty good and we had no complaints about the serve staff.  
Finally, the ambiance was just fair.  No table cloths, paper napkins, etc.
In summary, Savoir Faire does not deserve more than a 2 star rating.  It is inexpensive, but very average.",-1
4,"Tasty French food at a reasonable price. It was a busy Saturday night, but service was still good.  Was a great find for dinner.",1
5,"Cutest little french bistro in central London. Two of us were there for dinner on a Sunday night and it gets really busy so try and make a reservation ahead of time. Dinner comprised of a set menu of two courses with a range of options for the starter and mains. We had the grilled mussels and pan fried foie gras as our appetizers and they were both excellent. For our mains, we had the fillet of sea bass and the braised lamb shank. Although the lamb was good, the sea bass was definitely better - so good! Tried the creme brulee for dessert but I thought it was pretty average. There is also an extensive wine list to choose from. There can be a little bit of a wait for the food to arrive when the restaurant is really busy, but it's not excessively slow by any means. The food is excellent, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor is quirky and fun (there's writing on the ceiling!) and the service is friendly and efficient - definitely worth a visit.",1
4,"Good food, good service and reasonably priced. Savoir Faire is a lot more friendly than most French restaurants in London, and feels better for it.",1
5,"A block from Tottenham Court station. Their slogan is ""Affordable gourmet food,"" and it's true. I had a carafe of tempranillo, fig and goat cheese starter, authentic beef bourgignon, espresso and chocolate mousse. £33 isn't cheap, but for that meal is affordable, because it all *was* gourmet. The decor is fun and colorful, the waitresses friendly and authentically French. It's possible to spend less there, for less dinner: the tempranillo was £11 of my total. But the mousse was especially good. :)",1
4,"Yum! I had the Figs and Blue Cheese with Prosciutto for my app and the Gnocchi with sun-dried tomatoes for my main entree with a tasty little creme brulee for dessert. I must say over all, delicious. 
My 4 star rating comes from the service. We sat downstairs and as another review stated, we felt a little forgotten about. We were there to have a nice relaxing dinner, but by the time we were ready for the check we waited almost 30 minutes and then started to hunt for our server upstairs!",1
4,We ate here before the theater. This is a nice but simple  place with good food and good service.  I would certainly return.,1
5,"No disappointments here, as always, absolutely remarkable cuisine and ambiance. The staff bend over backwards to make sure your meals are most satisfactory and they don't skimp on portions either.
A wonderful place to take guests or just to enjoy a bottle of wine and escargot!",1
5,"Amazing food, huge portions, dirt cheap prices. My new London fav.",1
4,"I have eaten at Savoir Faire on and off for many years and when I am in London this is always worth a stop. Visitors I have brought here have never been disappointed. I favor the baked escargot, duck and the house red wine. Enjoy!",1
4,"I struggle to give this place a five, but it is solid and one of the few places in London where you get a lot for your money.  We were seated at the front of the restaurant, and every time someone walked through the door, you would hear a dinging noise go off.  A bit annoying.  The atmosphere is great and the waitresses were very nice and always smiling--what a treat.  The food was good , but nothing mind-blowing or spectacular.  It was an enjoyable meal, but nothing I am rushing to go back for.",1
4,very nice little place. I had the rib eye steak which was delicious. My friend's lamb shank was nice too. We shared a goose rillette (nice as well) and a coffee brûlée which was amazing.,1
3,"Interesting place. It's a great deal, particularly considering the location. The food's average-to-good, but definitely nothing to write home about - classic bistro cooking, the flaws being e.g. too tough beef bourguignon, lack of flavour in a couple of the dishes. However, a few things let it down. First, the service, while friendly, is slow and inattentive (whenever we needed one of the waiting staff, there was no-one to be seen and I spent more time than I liked trying to catch their eye). Second, the decor is basic but a few things need some touching up, and e.g. the cutlery/glassware look very much like they belong in a school canteen. Third, the wine selection is very ordinary, which is shame for a French restaurant - we had one of the more expensive bottles and, while inoffensive, it wasnt very interesting. I'll definitely bear it in mind for the future, but you won't find me going out of my way to come back, and especially not with a date or someone I'm trying to impress. There are much better restaurants in this kind of category (Comptoir Gascon instantly springs to mind, as does Le Mercury).",-1
5,"Whenever I'm in London this is always my first choice place to go to eat. It used to be a Pierre-Victiore and has kept the cheap bistro fixed price menu ethos. At two courses for £10 the menu provides great value and often contains some exciting ingrdients such as duck breast or sucking pig. The staff are casual but attentive and friendly. It is often busy has a vibrant atmosphere.
Another plus point of the restaurant is the way that they respond to a problem. We had an awful meal there (on one of our 30 odd visits) and they could not do enough to put it right. 
Without wanting to sound too sentimental this restaurante has been part of some great memories for me and everyone should give it a go. Some of the best value food in London.",1
5,"Just came back from dinner at Savior Faire, and I am still thinking about the food we enjoyed so much. For starter, I had fried goat cheese with caramelized pears. My main entree was duck with caramelized oranges, carrots, and zucchini, and potato gratin. The food melt in my mouth. The flavor was scrumptious!! I would recommend that place to anyone who visits London. Our experience at that restaurant was very positive.",1
5,Loved the authentic French cuisine and the price was reasonable too.  Can't beat that!,1
4,"Well, it was our last night in London and we were looking for a suitable restaurant.  Being the Yelper that I am, I set about with researching.  We have some picky eaters in our group, so that added another element of difficulty.  As a bunch of Francophiles, I thought a French restaurant would be a good choice.  Based on the preceeding Yelp reviews, we finally settled on Savoir Faire.  I was intrigued by the basement grotto, so when I made the reservation on Open Table, I requested that we be seated down there.  This was good because we got a bit raucous and silly as the meal progressed.  
Well, we were not disappointed by Savoir Faire in the least. We all ordered the two course, prix fixe menu.  I began with the roasted figs accompanied by stilton and prosciutto.  They were just lovely!  Then I tucked into the magret de carnard, but I felt that the duck was a bit over-cooked (Erin agreed).  I also had a nibble of Maeve's beef bourguignon.  Delicious!  The gnocchi that Courtney had was a bit odd looking, but she said it was good.  Chris and Miguel both had the Creole chicken and they cleaned their plates.  We also had about 5 bottles of some white wine (Chardonnay, I believe).  For desert we ordered a couple creme-brulees, the banoffee pie (my favorite!), and a very sad chocolate mousse (more like a pudding cup).  The wait-staff was nice, but we often felt a bit neglected at times. I guess that's what you get for hiding away in a cave.  The murals on the walls also provided some amusement for our group and some of them were pretty risque! Overall, a tres bon experience!",1
4,I stumbled across this place about 10 years ago and have been regularly returning. Very well prepared French dishes at remarkably reasonable prices. My favorite has always been the Duck Magret with on sauteedd Leeks and Potato with Orange and Balsamic Sauce. Always nicely done. If you're heading to Shaftsbury theatres they have wonderful pre-theatre specials and will see to it that you are out in time for the show.,1
5,"What can I say that hasn't been said?  This place is absolutely charming.  It manages a balance between a cozy cafe and a more sophisticated feel.  The painted murals on the walls make the small room seem larger and friendly.  We came in for a very late lunch and the owner (we presume) greeted us immediately, made a very good wine suggestion and defeated every stereotype of snooty French right away.  Our waitress was a bit cold, to be honest, and seemed irritated with us when she brought us the wrong wine...but really she wasn't RUDE, just not the smiley sort that another Yelper had mentioned.  We had steak with chips and salad...simple food that didn't seem entirely French in my mind, but was prepared so beautifully that I can't wait to go back.  Excellent value for money!",1
4,"Excellent French food, friendly and efficient service, nice atmosphere without being large or noisy, great all-around experience",1
5,"Good meat, nicely sized portions, sauvignon blanc priced well and tasted better than vinegar.  Made a reservation on open table and they treated me very well",1
4,A traditional French bistro which does an excellent set pre or post theatre dinner. Try and get a seat downstairs if you can. Excellent set menu which represents good value for money and choices change on a regular basis. The staff are attentive and its always pretty full which is always a recommendation. This is the sort of place to take your mum when she comes to visit or a date for a low key dinner. The desserts are a definite highlight especially the banoffee pie.,1
5,"Wonderful, wonderful French food and a wonderful atmosphere. Great place for a leisurely romantic dinner. Highly recommended!",1
5,"While visiting London, wife and I decided on a nice dinner in the city! Nobu didn't disappoint! Just a tip,  call ahead and make a reservation.  
5 stars for taste of food
5 stars for service 
We took an Uber so not sure about parking",1
2,"The food is great. The noise level is simply intolerable. It was so loud that every guest at very at every table had to shout, so the noise level was off the charts. They sat us under a big dome which is the WORST architectural feature ever for a restaurant. I hated every minute of this experience (excluding the delicious food). Install some baffles, and I'll be back. Until then, I'll avoid this place.",-1
4,"Food: 4.0/5.0
Service: 4.0/5.0
Value: 2.5/5.0
Decor: 4.0/5.0
Overall: 4.0/5.0 
Did the larger omakase option.  Pretty good meal with good service, but the food was honestly not mind blowingly good and the plates had smudges in them.  Not super surprised M took away the *.  Still a nice spot to try but its Mayfair, so.. be ready for that.",1
5,"I visited Nobu on New Year's Day, which could have been a risky move but it paid off as it was amazing. The restaurant was full and service was a bit on the slow side to start but once we got our food it was game on. My friend and I ordered two bento boxes, the classic and the deluxe and shared them between us as well as some California crab rolls as well. It was plenty of food and we couldn't finish it all. The highlight for me was the black cod, which I also had on my last visit to Nobu. We decided to squeeze in dessert and shared the cheesecake, it was amazing and a great way to round off the meal. The presentation was great and it was tasty and refreshing, I would definitely recommend it. I can't wait to go back!",1
4,"No doubt NOBU is always a nice place, just about anywhere you go. 
This specific location is in the heart of Mayfair, which by default makes the crowed a good and professional one.
Food is very creative and original with a twist for just about every plate. 
Service is very good. 
Downstairs has only a bar (cool one) and a large couch seating lounge. Big stairs takes you to upstairs, where the dining room is.",1
5,"This Nobu in particular had a really good dessert that I have been craving since I went. It was a chocolate ball with ice cream inside. The thin chocolate shell melts as hot chocolate is poured on top of it.  I was a little sad when I went to another location in Las Vegas to find that their desserts were different.Next time I'm in London I'll definitely come back to this Nobu for dessert!
Also, the appetizer salmon tacos are TO DIE FOR! I have to get them every time I go.",1
2,"This particular Nobu restaurant seems to have lost quite a bit of its exclusivity and high standards in terms of service. Been to the NY location a few years ago and me and my family were extremely impressed!
Therefore, went today and was really looking forward to it. We were welcomed and everything was good, bathroom didn't look like the NY location at all, just very simple and generic.
We were seated on wooden chairs and I asked whether we could sit on a soft couch twice, on which the reply was; sorry that is not possible while there were plenty of benches available...
Their salmon & tuna sashimi tasted just like the one u can get at YoSushi; like plastic. Maybe this is more of an environmental issue but still then don't dare to charge a Nobu price.
After I refused to pay the optional service charge due to dissapointing fish quality and just rude seating arrangements, I was treated like a criminal - never again at this Nobu location that's for sure!",-1
2,"There's a reason why it's so hard to get a booking at Zuma and yet it's so easy at nobu...
It didn't start well. We were a group of 3, there were a fair few tables empty and yet we were given a tight tiny table for 2. I refused such a bad table and was given a proper sized table.
Service was terrible, slow and quite frankly useless from start to end. 
At an early evening booking, how do you run out of the rib eye steak? Or that there was no Sauvignon blanc by the glass? That's pretty poor.
Anyway, had the tacos, nothing particularly special. A selection of sushi and sashimi, decent taste with the fish as expected, the rice in the sushi was not the best made, fell off too,easily.
The shrimp tempura was fine, but Zuma is another level, much nicer, they serve the whole shrimp in a much better batter. The asparagus tempura was fine, bit greasy, slightly too thick hence they were still a bit hard to break on the end pieces.
I had ordered rice to come with the miso cod which was next. That rice never came so fish by itself, as tasty as the fish is, you need something else with it. Very disappointing.
Finally the last course of tenderloin steak with rice finally. That was cooked rare perfectly and hat a spicy kick to it that worked. 
Dessert was just green tea ice cream and petite fours. Was ok.
At the end they apologized for the slow/lacking service and gave the dessert free of charge but quite frankly 
, it shouldn't have been that bad.
The service needs to improve. Zuma will stay number 1 by miles in my book.",-1
5,"Super trendy and super loud. Restaurant has two levels and it's packed, like a night club! Service is plentiful, fast and efficient. Food come out quickly after ordering. We took the liberty of ordering 4 dishes at a time , tapa style to share, as we didn't know how much we were gonna eat. Each dish were delicious! Love the Octopus Carpaccio and the Waygu Beef, as the most memorable dishes. Expect to spend ££££ money here! Yeah it's worth it!",1
5,"How can you go wrong with Nobu? Great location for dinner and drinks, whether it be with friends, cowormers, or that special someone. Service was impeccable which you could expect for the price you pay. Have been to several other locations like las Vegas and San Diego, CA with lavish decorations and decor. This location seemed a bit lacking with the ""wow"" factor decor-wise. The food however is what you would expect from a 5 star restaurant. Every dish expertly prepared and plated. All sashimi was as fresh as could be and paired with a bottle of Brunello seemed to make everything taste even better. Wagyu is a must have and a recommended favorite! 5 stars for food, taste, and service. 
Be prepared to spend large when coming to Nobu. Dinner for 2 came out to about $480 pounds with 15% gratuity included.",1
3,"Erm... Where to start? So much to say... 
So we decided to do the very cliche thing - go to Nobu for Valentines Day! We dont really put much importance on Valentines day, its more an excuse for a fancy dinner! However we did have high expectations in terms of food. I remember many moons ago being repeatedly told by a friend in Rome that Nobu was the best restaurant in London. I remember thinking it would take me quite a few years before being able to afford. Although ive been able to for a couple years now, never got round to it, so this was exciting stuff. 
I want to start by saying the food was amazing. Really absolutely fantastic - ill go into more details below. However, when you pay this much and when you go somewhere with such a reputation you expect more, much more. So lets beginning:
Absolutely no atmosphere, no vibe, nothing. This place has no soul. White walls, no decoration, nothing to excite you. Very bad very loud music, i guess thats what they might call ""atmosphere"", but you could barely hear yourself think and even less talk. Seats and tables were particularly uncomfortable. Lots of fancy people in fancy clothes but nothing else. Thats gotta be why it lost its star... Great food just isnt enough for michelin starred restaurants. You want an experience with insane food. 
Service was decent considering it was Valentines Day and surely a particularly busy evening. 
The food though... Thats another story, we had the Valentines Day 6 course menu, so didnt get to try the special and ph so famous black cod. However, i was not dissapointed with any ofthe dishes. They looked good and tasted good. Fancy japonese food at its best, combination of exciting flavours & luxury products (from a little caviar to classic lobster) cooked to perfection. Every dish was exceptional. Quick mention for the dessert, which i guess i expected less off. It was stunning, fresh & tasty. 
If we look at the food alone, i highly recommend, i wodeven want to go again and again and again. However you cant ignore the price tag, ita not cheap obviously. For thatprice id want thw food to be outstanding but also the restaurant also the atmophere... So overall, if you are looking for amazing food i would recommend, but if you are looking for an experience out of this world i wouldnt recommend. Honestly im not sure ill be back.  
However, super keen to try Zuma now!",-1
3,Not my favorite nobu . Tried it three times and I have a problem with the waiters ( I hate when it happens I am not eating for free please do your job or go work at a fast food) . The park lane one is better and ohhhhh man I miss nobu Malibu .,-1
5,"Was taken here for a meal before Christmas and as usual it was awesome. The food is simply stunning and the service incredibly attentive. The sashimi selection and beef tataki were amazing. I would go more often if I could afford it! The only thing I would say is we were at a table that was a little tucked away from the main area so the atmosphere was a little quiet, however this did not hamper our experience at all!",1
3,"The Nobu restaurants are one of my favorites because of their usual amazing food and service.  However, I was disappointed when I recently visited Nobu Berkeley Street. Though the food tasted wonderful as usual, I was very agitated with the table service. I was sitting at a small table and servers continued to attempt to crowd the table with dishes, which made me feel rushed like they were trying to turn our table quickly. At other Nobu restaurants, dishes are served one by one so the guests can enjoy their dishes. The atmosphere of Nobu Berkeley street is loud: playing club lounge type music making conversation between those at your table difficult. If you are looking for Asian fusion, I would recommend you going across the street to Novikov's Asian restaurant where the food is delicious and service on point.",-1
5,"I had a quick dinner at the bar last week and Nobu continues to be a great place for food and drink.  I tried the four horsemen cocktail which was a very interesting whiskey drink.  I had the field greens, salmon sashimi and a tuna roll.  The food was fresh and delicious and the salad is one of the stars of the menu.  I could eat the dressing by itself it is so amazing.",1
5,"One of London's best Japanese restaurant!
High-end food and  service, makes it a great experience, you can't really go wrong with the order.....what ever you will get would be taste and full of flavours. I Highly recommend to visit this one Michelin star restaurant.",1
4,"Had my first meal in London at this spot. This place has a nice decor, food was  good and the service was excellent. My GF made reservations in advance, so seating was a no problem when we got here. This restaurant is classier, so if you're trying to save or eat on a budget, don't bother coming. One dish you must order is the Black Cod. It is flavorful and melts in your mouth. It is the one dish that stands in my mind that i want again
yelp.com/biz_photos/nobu…",1
5,"Came here for lunch for my Sisters Birthday. Greeted at the front of the restaurant very politely and someone took our coats. Didn't have chance to sit at the bar but it looked stunning!
Went up to the Restaurant where the atmosphere was great. Not too quiet so you can laugh and have a good conversation without being loud. 
Ordered cocktails, sake and two Deluxe Bento boxes which were stunning. The Mojito is easily the best I've had. Food portions are generous so you won't be hungry! All the food tasted of very high quality and the service was fantastic. 
Price including a fabulous birthday cake and service was £250. Don't be put off, you do get what you pay for!",1
4,"Drink: order lychee martini,  it was good as most of thirty cocktail tend to taste sweeter.  But if u r into strong achoholic taste,  Nobu cocktail may be not for u, instead,  u can try their sake.
Food: heard about this restaurant for long time and their famous waiting time for reservations.  Compared to other fusion restaurant I have tried, the food here is better than average,  but also a bit over rated. 
The best dishes are the prawn tempura with their amazing three dipping sauces,  salads are good too with nice dressing, their seafood main courses r very good . 
But I am disappointed by their sushi compared to other similar restaurant.  There are gaps for improvement to perfection. 
Tacos are interesting,  the filling are good, but Tacos can be more crispy to make the dish work better. 
Desserts are better than normal restaurant,  but  less innovative compared to similar restaurant I have tried in London.",1
4,"We really enjoyed our dinner.  Granted, it was £320 for 3 people, so keep that in mind, for that price, it should have been mind blowing.  Arrived promptly at 9pm, but our table wasn't ready, went to the bar for a drinks.  Half our drinks were good, the other half, not so much, so really hit or miss.  We tried a total of 7 at £16 a pop I believe.
Dinner upstairs, we had the tasting menu, 2 regular tasting menus, and 1 vegetarian with a chicken addition.  Funny thing was that the vegetarian with chicken was only £4 less than the regular tasting menu, and the regular tasting menu had the same chicken dish on it.
Anyways, our server was pleasant, water refilled, never a problem with service.  And atmosphere was great.  Can't complain.  Just be ready to spend when you are here, and it'll be a good time.",1
4,"This place is spectacular!
The restuarant is based in Mayfair, London. So you would expect the dining experience to be above average, which it was. 
The staff know the menu very well and explained it to me thoroughly. I opted for a la carte rather than the tasting menu.
The food:
The flavours are astonishing and presentation is wonderful.
This place dropped the 1star michelin and to be frank, I dont think it effected the food, as everything I ordered was, indeed, tasty. The service was spot on as staff were attentative, given that the place was very busy.
Overall. Nobu is classy, but pricey. My experience here, was a good one. However, I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic date or a special occasion. Therefore, I can see myself coming back to dine.",1
4,"The food was great and very well presented, the service was also brilliant with polite and responsive staff. 
The only problem I had was at a fun dressy restaurant it was a shame to see so many people allowed in wearing sweatpants and T-Shirts sitting next to very well dressed couples. A bit off putting but aside from that issue the food and service is great!",1
4,"Always an amazing experience at Nobu but especially this one! Came here on Halloween and the place was creatively decorated. We sat upstairs and had amazing service. The seating was a little odd because it seems that they try to stuff a bunch of tiny tables in one spot. The drinks are always to die for as is the desert. This location is literally in the heart of Mayfair and the crowd is pretty good. I would definitely return, seems like the only issue is that they try to stuff you in like a can of sardines!",1
5,my favourite restaurant of all time. The shrimp tempura and black cod is just heaven and melts in the mouth. Highly recommend Nobu.,1
4,"Favorite dishes in order 
King crab taco- mini mini taco but delicous 
Yellowtail with jalapeño- so good
Tuna tataki with ponzu sauce- good but then the flavor for me got tiring 
Black cod den miso- cooked well but a little bit too overpowering on sweetenes. 
Lobster wasabi- most expensive, too rich for my taste, and I think disappointingly the wasabi flavor doesn't come out very well
Drinks are amazing- the one in milk bottle was the best- naru bottle. Tastes like light creamy melted ice cream. 
Service and ambiance are great",1
3,"I was expecting Nobu to be very fancy and full of celebrities, but it was just a dimly-lighted and not particularly wonderful looking place. I have been to prettier restaurants and there certainly weren't any celebrities there that night. 
I was hoping the food would be out of this world, but it was like other places, there were a few things that were really good and most were just okay. It didn't feel like a special dining experience or a culinary journey. 
The Creamy Spicy Rock Shrimp Tempura started out tasting okay, but the serving was quite huge (it is not cheap so I suppose that's why) and the more of it you eat, the more ill you feel. It is okay only in small amounts, but 2 people trying to eat a mountain of it is just ruining the experience. It is just too creamy and too heavy.
In general, Nobu had decent food, the tataki was good, but nothing to justify the price tag and it certainly wasn't exciting in terms of atmosphere.",-1
5,"This is the best meal I have ever experienced in my whole life. 
Everything from the food, to the wine and dessert. The funny thing is that I always order special sushi, but this time I went for nigiri and it is the best sushi I have ever tried.
The salmon tacos as an appetizer is recommended.
The service, venue and food was all worth the price and you pay for the overall experience. I can not wait to go back.",1
5,"I've heard the cuisine at Nobu described as 'new style' Japanese, but never truly understood what this meant until now. The food is in a class of it's own - absolutely phenomenal! The seafood and meats are of the highest quality, which alone makes the food stand out. Add to this perfectly balanced flavors and textures and it doesn't get any better. Dining at Nobu was a tasting experience that I'd best describe as 'blow your mind' good, which puts this meal on my 'best things I've eaten' list. 
Everything from food prep to service was also spot on. The quiet confidence of the sushi chefs along the counter expertly and precisely preparing each dish is an impressive sight. And the servers are also on their game, working together to quickly usher each order from the counter to the tables as soon as they are ready. We ordered a number of things to share and each dish arrived at our table with perfect timing. 
My only small nit about the restaurant was the dome shaped ceiling design that resulted in some strange acoustics where we were seated. We could clearly hear the conversation of a table on the other side of the room. We ended up sliding our table over a few inches which seemed to dull the effect a little.
I can't wait for the next occasion when I return to Nobu (perhaps to check out another of their famous locations). Until then, I have the following sweet memories...
Run down of the dishes we ordered:
Japanese Julep Cocktail - Got things started at the bar downstairs with this refreshing twist on a traditional julep made with Yamazaki whisky. 
Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna - Fun presentation! Crunchy cubes of crispy rice on sticks that you dip in soy and add a scoop of spicy tuna before popping in your mouth. 
Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - My favorite dish of the night simply because the sashimi was unbelievably fresh, some of the freshest yellowtail I've ever eaten.
Soft Shell Crab Roll - These crispy crabs didn't disappoint. Crunch, crunch, yum. 
Fresh Salmon Sashimi - Like butter. Need I say more?
Shitake Anti Cucho Peruvian Style Skewer - Surprising transformation of a simple mushroom. They nailed the flavors on this one. 
New Style Wagu Sashimi - 2nd favorite dish of the night. Wagu melts in your mouth. Our friends ordered a different preparation of wagu sashimi, which was not as good. Definitely go for the 'new style' wagu!
 'Dragon Eyes': Warm Chocolate and Zabayon Ganache served with Crema Catalana Ice Cream, Pistachio Garapinados and Mixed Berry Coulis - Ah, a happy ending 
Wine: Riesling 'Dachsfilet' D.Q Prinz Von Hessen  2009 Rheingau, Germanya - Great pairing with our meal. So good, we ordered a second bottle.",1
5,"The venue is beautiful and modern, the hostess was was very welcoming and we were seated quickly. The service was top notch, yielding another delightful Nobu experience. 
We got the Premium Prix Fixe menu, and the delicious courses did not disappoint. The standout of the night was the toro with truffles....amazing, maybe even cheating with such delectable ingredients! 
We can't wait to return to try the next Prix Fixe!",1
5,Always a pleasure to dine in Nobu.   Pretty swanky.   Good service.   Had a delightful lunch with delightful company.  Tuna and beef tartare were delicious.   Black cod a must to order.  Snow crab was yummy.  And the dessert ... Apple tart with peanut ice cream!   Happy to go back anytime.,1
3,"There's one thing you just have to know going into Nobu: it's expensive as all get out. Regardless of how much it costs to actually construct the dish, it will cost you an arm and a leg. It's kind of like Vegas, you just have to resolve yourself to a  certain ""sunk"" cost when you step inside. When you've made your peace with that, then you can make some smart choices to get the most enjoyment out of the 401k you gave up to eat there.
In terms of fish, I have to say that it's not the best, most flavorful, freshest fish I have ever tasted. Just like any other sushi joint, some days are better than others, and some cuts are better than others. Definitely ask what is best that day, because the sushi chefs will know. Remind yourself that you don't care about the price. The scallop has been very good, and of course you can rarely go wrong with Toro. Salmon is consistent but still not the best I've tasted.
The wagyu beef traditional style with two sauces is delicious. Sometimes you just can't beat a REALLY good cut of beef.
The hamachi and jalapeno starter is always a favorite of mine and Nobu does it to a standard almost worthy of the price.
while miso glazed black cod isn't the most original of dishes anymore, it's still addictive, and just as flaky as you remember it the last time, every time. You will most likely never be disappointed ordering this.
The sashimi salads are also a great starter. I'm partial to salmon, but the tuna is also very good. The dressing is light and the greens are a really refreshing starter, especially when you've been eating nothing but heavy british food for awhile which I have been guilty of.
The rock shrimp tempura is a classic. The shrimp is meaty, the tempura is not too oily, and there's a lot of it. So it's good for larger parties.
In summary, I like going to Nobu because of the atmosphere and the service and just the overall feeling of luxury and being spoiled. Since the price is 5x more expensive than other places, is the quality 5x? meh, probably not. But like I said, if you are willing to put down the cash if only to guarantee a no hassle, relaxing, consistently delicious meal, Nobu will get the job done.",-1
4,This is exactly the same as the other Nobus but twice as expensive because you are in London and there is nowhere else to eat. The fact that it is in London and not worse than the NY and LA locations merits at least four stars.,1
4,"At Nobu, the food is always excellent. You need to book a long time in advance. The only complaint is that the prices are too high taking into account the variety you have in the area.",1
2,"Yes, the food is decent (though not spectacular by any means), the ambiance is great, and the service is competent, but the prices simply aren't justified by any of the above. I've had just as good or better food for much less money, served with much less pretense.",-1
3,Have been to Nobu in New York and Miami. Felt rushed here. Waiter made us feel rushed . If we mentioned a dish he would comment. I don't go often to Nobu but in the other places it was nice when the waiter took the time to offer suggestions when we weren't sure what to order. It was okay but the other restaurants have better atmosphere.   Place was packed though.,-1
5,"Went to Nobu for a client dinner.
The food was a conversation stopper. Both of us studied the food after our first bites because of how good it was. Each dish that we ate had the same effect, and that is not an easy feat to achieve.
Octopus Carpaccio with Bottarga (5/5): Very tender. 
Creamy Spicy Shrimp (5/5): Quite a nice kick to it. Have your water/beer close at hand.
Tuna Sashimi Salad with Matsuhisa Dressing (4/5): Probably what we liked least throughout the evening, but considering the competition - this is still high praise.
Chilean Sea Bass Yasai Zuke (5/5): Highlight of the night. Very well prepared, and a must if you visit this place.",1
5,"Went to Nobu for lunch with my colleagues our boss was buying :) 
The food was amazing, most of us got the Bento Nobu box. I ordered the Wagyu Rump with Anti- Cucho Sauce.
Everything tasted amazing from the tampura to the salad to my amazing Wagyu Rump. The service was very personal and gave us great attention. Described all the dishes to us and a bit more when there were questions.
The setting upstairs for lunch is very comfortable but the place was packed so I advice you to book in advance. Obviously for dinner thats a must because I know from experience you can hardly get a table for dinner unless a week in advance.
I rarely give 5 starts how ever this place with just the flavors of their food I give them all 5 stars.",1
5,"My friend and I were visiting London and decided to try a trendy place like Nobu since I love the one in South Beach not so much Malibu. We made our reservations online got a confirmation call the day before which was great. As we arrived we were greeted at the door checked coats in waited for no more than 15 minutes which is a good time to check out the bar and have a drink. The staff were very nice and friendly.  The place is very stylish, great crowd amazing food. Price was as it is at any upscale sushi restaurant, you get what you pay for. It was our last night in London and we got a great experience. Highly Recommended",1
4,"Great service, amazing food!  Went there the day we arrived to London.  Our server was fantastic and she was very knowledgeable and recommended dishes that were suitable to my dietary requirements.  The only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is because of the atmosphere - we sat next a a group with few kids behaving badly.  Even my child thought it was too much!!",1
3,"Some nice dishes (e.g., black cod) but I have three complaints:
1) overpriced
2) uneven service
3) celebrity ass-kissing
4) noisy
It is in some ways like all the other Nobus, that is fairly good sushi but more about the scene than the food. A long ways from the good old days of Matsuhisa on La Cienega in LaLaLand.",-1
5,"My first Nobu experience and I loved it. 
The ambiance was overall gorgeous although perhaps a little stuck up.
Dinner for two along with cocktails was well over several hundred. I hope to be back.",1
3,"3.5 stars. Came here with a friend for the first time with high expectations. Big mistake. I've had much better sushi back home in San Francisco for the same price or much cheaper. Heres what we ordered:
1. Hamachi Tartare - pretty good, loaded with wasabi and topped with caviar so beware if you don't like wasabi. 
2. Salmon Tacos - MEH, it came with a ""spicy salsa"" which wasn't spicy... and the tacos were about the size of a pringle. -_-
3. House Special Roll - Nothing out of the ordinary. Anyone can make this roll... just stuff salmon, tuna, and ebi into a roll and voila, you have Nobu's House Special Roll. 
4. Uni - Fresh, worth the 18 pounds it cost? Not sure.
5. Ikura - Equally fresh
6. Toro - Amazing
7. Hamachi - Don't even bother.
8. Mackerel - YUM.
9. Dessert - Chocolate Bento Box - EHHHHHHHH. Whatevs. 
HOWEVER, I ordered a glass of Billcart-Salmon Rose - this was the best glass of rose I've ever had. If you are a big champagne drinker, do not pass this up !
Service was exceptional (after all this place has atleast 20 of them running around aimlessly)
Even though my experience at this Nobu didnt meet my expectations, I'm still going to try the Los Angeles location but if I'm ever in London again, I doubt I'd come back.",-1
5,"We were lucky enough to wander across the street from our hotel to bump into Nobu.  Walked in without a reservation, and after a bit of schmoozing with the manager, got a table in the middle of the lounge.  Great ambiance there...a huge tree as a backsplash on the bar with lots of tea light candles.  The bar area got packed fast; not where you go for a romantic dinner...but perfect for dinner/drink pregame.  The tables are somewhat low and small, with cushiony backless curved seats, which was inviting for mingling on a busy Saturday.
Among amazing things to put in your mouth:
-lobster ceviche, sea bass sashimi, softshell crab harumaki with wasabi, pumpkin tempura...and to chug: wash it all down with a green tea martini (okay fine, sip it.  What fun are you)
Definitely expensive, so maybe not your go-to sushi spot, but worth checking out!",1
5,"A few months ago, I had the pleasure of dining at Nobu in London, and it was a sublime experience from start to finish.  The ambience is, of course, very elegant, and the dining area is perfectly laid out to keep conversations private while still giving you the chance to see and be seen.
My friends and I did the pre fixe tasting menus, and found that each option delivered a consistently excellent and balanced series of dishes, each crafted to deliver something different with each round.
The food was expertly plated, and despite European custom, the portions were actually quite large when added up.
The service was uncharacteristically friendly and attentive, though it seemed that each waiter was a little bit overworked.
The downstairs bar offers an interesting mix of ridiculously overpriced drinks, but there are some great features, like a mojito served with honey dripping from a honeycomb, and a nice selection of hard alcohol.  The lounge area is even louder and more crowded than the dining room, and if I had one complaint, it would be that they let too many people into the bar at any one time.
All in all, Nobu is a spendy evening, but given the quality of food, it's certainly not overpriced.  If you're thinking of going, plan ahead: Nobu is pretty much reservation-only and reservations open up 30 before the desired date.  Spots go fast.",1
5,"Perfect for a special occasion, every dish I've tried has been delicious.  There's something for everyone - the meat is as wonderful as the sushi and fish. And this isn't just about the food, the service is exceptional and it has a great atmosphere too.",1
4,"The velvet rope outside let me know what kind of a scene I would be in for. I'm pleased to say that this is the only velvet rope I've encountered and was taken right inside. Unfortunately, we were early and had to chill in the lounge. This place was a meat market. Dudes in shirts unbuttoned to their navels looking like Tom Jones and ladies with their bits spilling all over. Wow. 
Dad, I think he's going he's going to pork her. 
He's not going to pork her, Russ. 
I think he's gonna. 
He may pork her. 
Thankfully, we were taken upstairs and had a great table. The food is fantastic and that is what I love here. The sushi is great here and we had the spicy tuna and California rolls. Solid. Rock shrimp with ponzu sauce, grilled octopus, and spicy shrimp ishiyaki. We get the rock shrimp every visit and you should too, it's one of the best things on the menu. Our other new choices were hits as well. The Uozo pie with the oatmeal cookie and dulce de leche ice cream was a nice ending. Service was good. 
Nobu is always a great meal. This scene was unlike anything I've seen and outdid the one in Vegas, if that gives you any idea. I love the food. But, could do without the club. This was also more expensive than Boxwood which is ridiculous.",1
5,"While my fav nobu is in Malibu, California (USA) because of the amazing view and for the fact that it's brand new...this Nobu in London is the coolest. Awesome lounge! The place to be, like they say in the UK; super posh! Food is always awesome anywhere you go in the world since it's pretty standard that all nobus are the same menu etc. but what sets this one apart from others is the awesome service and cool crowd at the bar :) most def worthy of a visit!",1
4,"Great place for a dinner or catch up. It was rather pricey but the food was amazing so I guess you get what you pay for! The Miso Cod and Tuna were my favourites, so I would recommend these! The bar downstairs was nice to relax in till our table was ready and the cocktails are delicious! I wouldn't hesitate to come here again, but only for a special occasion.",1
1,"Had dinner here last Tuesday (Dec 2,2014)and what a disappointment it was. First off, the bill for the two of us was $203.00. I don't drink and my partner had one glass of wine.Waiter was inattentive and bordered on being rude.Decor is tired.Food was just so-so.Certainly get  better here in Northern New Jersey. Just another tourist trap.Mad at ourselves for ever going there.",-1
1,Horrible atmosphere. Extremely loud. Stupid and unthoughtful opening times. Definetely not worth the money but food is good.,-1
5,"I LOVE Nobu, I have been to 4 different locations and this one is the best. 
The highlights
Seared Toro with Yuzo Miso & Jalapeno Salsa-amazing
Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno- favourite
Rock Shrimp Tempura with Ponzu, Creamy Spicy or Jalapeno- good
O-toro sushi- out of this world
fresh salmon sushi- out of this world
Lobster tempura with Spicy Lemon Dressing- words cant not describe
best part of nobu... J.J. Prum reisling.",1
2,"Horrible. This place disappoints big time. I've been to the Nobu in NYC and while it's not stellar there either, this place is 10x worse. Hard rice sushi, doesn't taste fresh, mini sashimi taco shells are completely stale and overwhelms the fish. You take one bite and everything falls apart and onto your plate. Sigh. Menu is a little boring and not the most inventive. I wanted to order uni/sea urchin, didn't have it that night. I wanted to order the watercress salad, didn't have that either. =/
If you're going to spend this much money on food and a sexy atmosphere, go to Hakkansan instead. I first went there when I was living in London years ago and I still prefer it over Nobu.",-1
3,"The food was good and the ambiance was decent, definitely a restaurant to see and been seen.  The sushi was good but I'm from the Seattle where the sushi is much better, fresher and more reasonably price (even at the high end sushi restaurants)
The service was decent, the waiter kept forgetting our order or giving it to the table next to us.  
If you're interested in hanging out with the young, rich and fabulous of London, I definitely recommend a visit.  If you're on a budget, I would pass.",-1
2,"Wow, so uppity and snobbish which might have been worth it IF I hadn't found a bone in my sea bass sashimi. In their defense, they did give me my dinner and a free dessert (ice cream filled mochi which were really inventive and good)! Still, been to sushi all around the world and have never experienced a bone before!! Overrated...",-1
5,"It's predictable to give this restaurant five stars because of its perceived reputation, but it's taken me close to ten years to get around to eating here as I've always had the misconception that it's 'just a posh sushi restaurant that celebs and rich people eat at!' 
Well that may be true, but it does great vegetarian food (at lunch service  at least) - best Donburi I ever had with squash and other seasonal vegetables and the tempura...I've had my fair share of battered veggies - but this was in a league of its own. Just thank god I wasn't paying!
However it's not a drop in a dine place. Book online in advance is recommended for dinner, and the must-have 8PM table booking seems to be nigh-on-impossible. If anyone has a tip on how to get one of those slots, do let me know!",1
4,"Been here many times and the one on Park Lane, prefer the the second location, this Berkeley location has become more of the show-off spot for wanna-bes.
The food is always great, they do rotate the menu, not very often or a large proportion of it but at least they try. pleasant atmosphere with waiters with great manners and experiences. Food is always fresh, the miso black cod is one of my favorites!
It's Nobu and it's located in mayfair obviously it's not on the cheap and cheerful side, but it's a great place for a fancy night out dinner.",1
4,"Nobu is one of my favorite restaurants to dine at in many cities around the world...and London is no exception.  My friend and I arrived for an early dinner at 6:30 PM ready for some good food/sushi, incredible service, and perhaps even some celebrity sightings. And we got 2 out of the 3...
The food/sushi:
Crab Tacos- very small portion, but tasty
Tuna Tataki- melt in your mouth tuna
Hot chips & tuna- one of my favorite appetizers of the evening
Lobster Tempura Entrée- can't go wrong with fried lobster, but this was a bit overrated.  Not any better than any shrimp tempuras I've had and the lobster staring at us kind of freaked us out.
Sushi: yellowtail roll, shrimp tempura, and eel. The shrimp tempura roll was the best among the 3, but all were good. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't really have any specialty rolls.
The drinks were INCREDIBLE. My sherry cherry had egg white in it (LOVE that) and my friend oooh'd and aaah'd over her lynchee martini.
Service: Our waiter was beyond patient with us as we took FOREVER to decide on what to order and quizzed him about celebrities he's seen at Nobu. He was extremely attractive too so made for good eye candy, although unfortunately for my single friend we were pretty sure he batted for the other side. 
Celebrities: No celebrities (besides us of course!) on that Sunday evening we happened to be at Nobu, but hottie waiter informed us that Brittney had just canceled a private party there for that week. He's also seen Naomi Campbell and Cristina Aguilera recently. However, he told us we'd have better luck seeing celebrities at their other location in London because that's where they tend to go.",1
4,"Came here with my boyfriend because we were craving quality sushi at one point. The décor is exactly what you'd expect of a Mayfair venue: elaborate, dim-lit, and exotic in some way. I wore a dress and heels and still felt a bit under-dressed when I looked around and everyone looked done up to the extreme.
We had an assortment of sashimi but the most memorable part of the meal was the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño appetizer, yum! The damage was just over £80 or so for both of us, decent for a Michelin star restaurant.
Also, it was a weekday and we got reservations for the day of, so if you're looking to go last-minute, it IS possible!",1
2,"Great drinks service at the bar, otherwise totally unimpressed service wise. Having been to Nobu in three other locations in the states and Matsuhisa on many occasions, with the reputation behind them and the prices on the menu I expect more. I've had better service at a pub eating bangers, beans & mash. The menu and quality of food was consistent with other Nobus (not my favorite Japanese but also didn't choose the restaurant). However, with the name Nobu, the address, the decor and the attitude I expect better service.",-1
4,"I've been here several times, and while the main event at Nobu may once have been the food... now it's all about ""the scene.""  
Not that the sushi isn't *some* of the best to be had in London... it is... it's just not the most memorable and astounding I've ever had.  Plus, instead of mere seaweed paper, the exterior of their maki rolls comes wrapped in this white, powdery, reminiscent-of-raw-won-ton-paper-like-stuff that I find just a smidge off-putting... I guess I'm a traditionalist in this particular sushi sense.
The cocktails, however, are *amazing.*  Don't come here without ordering one!  I'm especially partial to their version of mojitos... and I never even got into to that mojitos-are-all-the-rage craze.  Be warned though, *all* their fruity concoctions are deceptively strong... one mojito, two mojito... awww...why not a third?  And before you know it you are drunkety drunk drunk.
I should note that I've never once been impressed by the service here... sometimes nice, sometimes snooty or indifferent... but *always* slooooowww.  And I find the music just a touch too loud for decent conversation.
The lowdown?  If you have the money... you've probably already been here.  If not, you're probably contemplating it for a special occasion.  My take?  Unless you're really just looking for an ostentatious brand name restaurant, I'd go elsewhere... a place that's a little less clubby and where the impeccable service and food truly justify the extravagant prices.",1
5,"I was incredibly lucky to be taken here by a client last month. My, my, what a treat.
I pretty much let my hosts order a selection of bits and pieces (since they'd been to Nobu all around the world - raving about ALL except Milan).
We tucked into edamame beans and a special beef dish, following by an array of the finest sushi I've ever had the pleasure of eating. In fact, the yellowtail tuna with jalepenos turned my taste to tuna. It was pickled in a kind of lime marinade with a spicy kick. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! I'd go back there just for that. We also had beautiful prawn hand rolls and avocado ones that melted in the mouth.
Additionally, the salmon nigiri was fresh and clean, the sake dangerously drinkable and the chocolate bento box (flourless chocolate fondant with green tea ice cream) was heavenly.",1
4,"Went here for a short dinner on my own. Was seated at the bar very promptly (on a Friday night without a reservation). Excellent sushi dinner, excellent raw fish from the ala carte as well. (I had grouper, which was surprisingly awesome, and another one that I can't recall the name of- not a common fish).
Very upscale and dressy, dress to impress.
Food is pricey, but the fish was top notch.",1
3,"Part of the Nobu chain in NYC, Vegas, etc. Good food, menu pretty expansive, but $$$. Service a bit spotty during parts of our dining experience.",-1
2,"I am fortunate enough to live in NYC where there is nothing you cannot find, food wise. I have been to many a great restaurant and many a bad one. I recently came to London on holiday and expected a similar experience n diversity. With that said, I wanted to go to dinner to a place that I ""knew"" would be good. I chose Nobu based on the reputation that their NY locations had, which is very good. 
I am sorry to say, I was severely disappointed, mostly by the service. I the food was very good, which is why I gave 2 stars and not one. The thing is that it is not hard to give good service OR good food but it is hard to give both. I expected both from Nobu. The guy barely spoke above a whisper. He didn't know his menu well. and had a very laxidasical about our satisfaction. In fact, he did not ask once how everything was. 
I have been to various levels of restaurants.  The thing that is always done is to check to make sure that everything came out as ordered and was satisfactory. This is at the crappy Applebee's all the way to the top restaurant that you can think of. For such a poor level of service to come from Nobu, especially at the $130 per person price point, is embarrassing for them.",-1
5,"I'm a little ashamed to say that I went here, just because of the mockery one gets because you went to a 'celeb' eatery. I am not a celeb spotter. I repeat, NOT a celeb spotter. I just came for the food.
And it was good. Damn good. Granted we only went for lunch and a special lunch at that, but the sashimi was so soft, so fresh and melted just like butter, it was hard not to fall in love with the excellent food here. My friend has the Wagyu beef, which was soft and seared on the outside. I really like the way the ginger slices were laid on top of the rice with nori and sesame seeds.
The service was of course, impeccable. Getting a table was really easy as well, and their organisation was superb. The place has nice decor, however the ambiance is not as relaxed as I'd like, but then, I don't think I'm their usual client with the usual demands. The staff were lovely, although everytime we thanked them for pouring our drinks into our glasses, they smiled faintly and sort of backed away as if they were trying to blend into the background. I imagine that's the way most customers want them to behave. Still, top marks for the rice/ginger/sesame seeds combo and wonderful sashimi.",1
5,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday last week for the first time after having a lovely experience for my own birthday a few months ago at the Old Park Lane branch and this one was just amazing - if not better.
 I would recommend the Berkeley Street Nobu for a romantic meal whereas Park Lane seemed better for a family or group meal as it was noisier and much more lively. Berkeley Street is absolutely gorgeous though and you really do get the Michelin Star experience from the red carpet at the entrance right down to the immaculate toilets!
 The service was a little slow but the food is so exquisite that it hardly even matters - the whole atmosphere of the restaurant is relaxed and casual and I think it's nice that the service gives you time to relax and chat in between courses rather than a stiff-backed silver service which often makes for tense dining.
 I tried a completely different selection of food this time and as much as I can recommend the same old favourites, (the black cod and the bento box most popularly) I thoroughly enjoyed my yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos, mixed oysters and ginger cheesecake.",1
3,"Nobu is a must when in London - especially in Mayfair. Get a reservation, save your pennies and come enjoy this place. Of course, know what you're getting yourself into (I say this a lot): it's busy, loud, trendy and rather expensive... but it's fun and the food is delicious. I'm a fan - and definitely over the other Nobus in London.
Get a drink at the bar first then sit down and order sushi, but also order some of the hot entrees. The black miso cod is a must, and the sea bass is a nice add-on. Ask the waiter about fresh specials - the fish is all very fresh but they usually have specials which shouldn't be missed!
Have fun here - I miss it!",-1
2,"Had better from Nobu, but was fine since we got in at the last minute.  There has got to be better sushi in London and this was only slightly better than Yo Sushi.  Really too bad as i have had fabulous sushi at Nobu in Atlantis.  The loud atmosphere made it almost impossible to talk with my friends, which helped make the experience mediocre.",-1
4,"Nobu is a place to be seen at - high heels, short dresses, expensive drinks and good sushi. Don't go in jeans and sneakers, you'll feel out of place. 
As for the food, we tried some of the sushi (the yellowtail was fantastic) and the tempura (eggplant was ok, shitake mushroom, not so much). It was a fancy version of a tempura at other Japanese restaurants. We also tried the set dinners - my husband enjoyed his teriyaki salmon while I opted for the chicken in wasabi pepper sauce, which I was told was spicy. But instead, it was rather bland, for my liking, and left me wishing that I had ordered either more of the yellowtail sushi or the salmon like my husband. For dessert, we had the chocolate fondant with green tea ice-cream. The cake was good, but I would have preferred normal vanilla ice-cream instead. As we were celebrating my birthday, the chef did do a personalized ""happy birthday"" in icing around the plate...
Most others were eating the set tasting menu and perhaps that's the way to go. But at £80-95 a person, it better be a super special dinner! 
All in all, it was a fun experience and I'd probably go back for more of the sushi...",1
5,"What can I write that hasn't already been said?  I've been to Nobu in NYC and LV and this one is as good as any. Impeccable service, wonderrful food and flavors, great atmosphere.  Yes it's spendy but in my view worth it. 
After I selected the wine, we put it the meal Into the hands of our server, and she did not disappoint. It's a good thing to do if you want to try some new dishes that you haven't tried before.  Very fun!
Highly recommended.",1
5,"Great bar, great cocktails and great service.. 
We didn't eat, but if you're looking to just cocktail.. then I highly recommend it!",1
5,"Of the two Nobu's in London I prefer this one for the bar and drinking experience. The bar area is pretty slick - I recommend the Vodka Mojito.
For some reason I prefer the food at the other Nobu - I have no idea why because really there is no reason for it being any different- but there you go. It is still awesome so don't get me wrong.
As with all Nobu's it is pricey... but it is worth it.",1
4,"Food was great, drinks were good, service, a bit slow and pretentious.  A co-worker and i just wanted to grab a bite at the bar and some drinks before we met some friends to go out for the night.  To be honest, the food was great (very fresh), and i would certainly go back for a full meal, but when we showed up it was a bit like trying to get in a club in vegas with 2 dudes...not going to work unless you have a 2:1 guy girl ratio.  
Anyhow, we ended up sitting at the bar upstairs and had our sushi prepared right in front of us.  Food was great, but the drinks, just a vodka tonic w/ extra limes and splash of red bull, took nearly 15+ minutes.  I'm sure we didn't get the attention of our waiter because our bill was not going to be substantial, but come on, it could deter me from going back.  By the time i finished the first drink, we had to wait another 10 minutes to order again!  I mean I'm sure they are running a for-profit business, but it didn't feel like it.
Giving 4-stars as the food was excellent, and the atmosphere was pretty cool.",1
4,"I wanted to try really good asian cuisine so when I was in London I had to go to Nobu!
The place is quite dark, it was packed and tables were very close, I could hear other couple conversation- not very intimate and we were told when making reservation that we will have 2 hours to eat- it doesnt sound very nice. Except that the service was great, very polite waiter. The food was great too, I had very tasty artichoke salad and sushi with st jacques. My boyfriend had chicken in teriyaki sauce with some really good mushrooms. For dessert we had chocolate bento box, lollipops and delicious ice cream mochi. Overall it was beautifully presented and delicious food.",1
4,What could be better than having a trendy and first class restaurant serving excellent Japanese cuisine? Well this is it!,1
5,"This is a great special occasion restaurant. We came here with a bunch of friends and enjoyed the way the staff shouted their greetings every time a new guest gets walked in.
I was looking very forward to the sushi, but living in San Francisco I must have gotten spoiled. While the sushi was good, the other dishes were that much more interesting. My favorite was probably the mushroom dish with lots of butter, but the cod was really good too.
And I remember dessert.... mmmmmmhhhh.....",1
4,Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno and OKUSETSU DAI-GINGO YK 40 pair well.,1
4,"Yes, I am a NOBU whore.. I cannot help it.. It is my goal to hit every NOBU restaurant on earth and sample the wares.
Silly? Yes, it is a bit silly since I always seem to order the SAME exact items, be it Nobu Tokyo, Nobu London, Nobu NY or Malibu.
Anyways, we were extremely lucky that a friend who works for a somebody got ""nobodies"" like us a last minute coveted reservation on a Wednesday for a 9pm Saturday night meal. Whoo Hoo!
We walk to the Berkeley Square location, hearing it was the newer location and near our hotel. I was surprised to see a velvet rope outside and inside, a rave-like atmosphere. Apparently, this is the place to get dressed up and go for the bar scene and dinner!
Our hostess literally seated us within 5 minutes of checking in to a lovely spot near the front window. Let the games begin!
I ordered my usual Creamy Spicy Rock Shrimp Tempura, I cannot share nor eat enough of this dish. M had the always crowd pleasing Yellow Sashimi with Jalapenos.. 
We tried a mushroom dish of several different varieties including truffles. It was a little expensive, maybe $20?? but DAMN, it was good.. so glad to have ordered it!
We skipped on the Black Cod Miso, which I love, and ordered a few rolls aside from the other dishes. 
Everything was wonderful, as always. The only thing that got me was the crowd scene and bumping, grinding rave music.. That, my friends, I could not stand behind. I guess we have that at KOI in LA, now that i think of it. 
Anyways, be it special occasion or if you are a foodie looking to indulge in some damn good fish, go to NOBU!!! Yay!!",1
4,"I had an Ex of mine take me here a few years after we broke up to make up for her dumping me. Does that make this Sympathy Dining? If so I want more, more, more! Any free meal is good but when it's at one of the most exclusive spots in town then it kind of makes up for all the heartbreak and stress... ok, now that I think about it, it doesn't at all. I should claim another free meal here.
So what can I say? I never would have seen myself dining here at this darling of the celebs, but she was paying and I wasn't saying no. I felt out of place in my H&M shirt and backpack from work, especially when she showed in a Chanel coat with a new 300 quid haircut. Fortunately though, the celebs on surrounding tables - some lady from ITV who wouldn't eat fish, the cute one from All Saints and the marvellous Goran Ivanisevic - all were dressed dowdy enough for me to fit in. Huzzah. I'm, a celeb... get me into here!
The food is wonderful, and for the price it's five-star outstanding when someone else is buying. We leant mostly on the Peru-side of Nobu's life, getting the crab tacos and the ceviche salad, but we did venture East to the Japanese connections. My ex was a regular at the Met's Nobu and knew what to get and how it compared to the best raw fish from her own home in the land the rising sun. The Wagyu beef with truffles and mushrooms was a dish I could eat every day. Sounds expensive doesn't it? You'd be surprised that it's not all that bad.
Moving Mr. Nobu to one side, the culinary highlight came from the subcontinent of all places, when the Indian pastry chef (Kotesh Kumar Khandala) pulled out 2 of the most complicated and sublime desserts I've ever tasted, full of fantastic flavours like green tea and adzuki. If you go to Nobu for one thing and one thing only, forget the black cod... it's the pudding you want.
The only downside to a night at Nobu apart from having to consolidate your loans the next days, is that it is too much of a scene. The downstairs bar is choc-full of arrogant moneywinners in suits bleeding the country dry. It's a painful place to be and you kind of hope that they all order some mis-prepared Fugu. Invariably when people think of Nobu they think of ridiculous wealth and the world's best sushi - but don't - it's not all that exclusive and if anything the sushi is the weakest link, the other dishes are the real gems.",1
4,"the kind of place you take a Belgium girl, a couple living in Switzerland, or just a place to super show off to your friends.
The place is famous for its sushi but I liked it best for its restaurant. don't get me wrong, my chocolate box dessert was divine and all but the sinks are soooo cool. wow, I couldn't help but feel touristy at Nobu as classy as it is and all its kind of like the Barney's New York of Asian food.
The food is really good i'm not gonna go off the rails and try to deny that. I tried fish here I never would anywhere else because its just the type of place that makes you feel really adventurous to do that sort of jazz.",1
4,"Good food, tons of posers if that's what you like...
I prefer down the street from Claridges old school place who's name I can't remember as it is so small on the left side of the road after you take a right out of Claridges...by the way, I miss Claridges...
Sake No Hana is excellent, Nozomi is pretty sweet with lots o' hotties but too loud for me",1
4,"In all honesty Nobu's chic atmosphere and nouveaux riche clientele are not the kind of experiences I seek on a daily basis. However, for special occasions and to pamper yourself there are few better locations.
Make no mistakes; the food is pricey but in exchange you receive a delicious and inventive menu, attention to detail and meticulous service.
A simple pleasure to eat sushi that fresh.",1
5,"Words can't describe this restaurant. Get the lobster salad, raw beef seared toro with yuzo miso & jalapeno salsa, chef's selection of sushi and sashimi (ask for additional yellowtail) and skip the dessert. Instead enjoy another cocktail. Yummy!",1
4,"Having eaten at Nobu London and many others (Miami, Nobu Tribeca, Nobu 57, Nobu LA, Nobu Malibu, Nobu Tokyo, Nobu Hong Kong, Nobu San Diego, Nobu Las Vegas) I can always find quality Sushi at all locations. Nobu Berkeley is very good but the most expensive being in the UK. 
The atmosphere here is very upscale with more formal service which you will not find in the USA locations. I do prefer this location over the London location. 
During the many time I have frequent this location I have been very satisfied with the food and service. 
If you plan to go here; do plan to spend upwards of five hundred dollars person for the high quality Japanese fish flown in daily.",1
5,"This place has one Michelin star whereas Nobu in Mayfair has three. I haven't been to the other one, but ambiance + food rock here. Prices are on the upper end of London standards, but you get what you pay for.",1
5,"I was once taken on a date here,which was great because I got to eat and drink my way through the menu without worrying about the cost, which was turning into a similar amount to my rent for the month. 
Nobu Berkeley Square is probably the best Nobu in London, in terms of atmosphere. Plus it has a kick-ass bar, which is every bit as sleek and sexy as you would imagine from a mega expensive restaurant in Mayfair. If you are heading here, don't even think about missing the bar, as it does some of the best cocktails in London. My favourite is the goji berry martini - a frothy creamy concoction of berry deliciousness. The Nobu mojito comes a near second. And look out for any cocktails which have sake in them, yummy.
So the food, well we all have heard the reviews . It really is as good as the hype suggests. I'm not quite sure how a menu which is styled as a mix of Japanese and Peruvian actually works, but it does. Probably the most famous dish is the Black Cod. It is slightly sweet, ever so soft, and one of the best dishes that you can have in London.
The food is expensive, but there are ways of keeping the cost down. Listen up - on the back page is a list of all-inclusive meals. For about £18.00 you can get a large bowl of chicken or prawn in teriyaki sauce with rice, and this comes with miso soup. The other thing to do is just order sushi. It is completely filling, and only about £6 or £7.00 for an hand cut roll. I could be completely happy here just sitting at the counter, sipping on a glass of wine, and having two or three plates of sushi. This would cost about £25.00, so it's not all bad news for us penniless types.",1
4,"You will often read in all the magazines about various celebrities 'coming out of Nobu' and that will give you a good idea as to the type of people who tend to go there. However, unlike some other celeb haunts, this is a genuinely fantastic sushi restaurant that you simply have to visit.
I went with a couple of friends and of course, we did make an extra effort with our attire and you never feel so bad if others see you wolfing down sushi as its healthy right? Anyhow, the food was so good that you can't help but gobble it all down - if you're not a fan of sushi they also serve some alternative fish dishes such as blackened cod which is possibly the best piece of fish I have ever tasted (and also the favourite of Lemar apparently). I had heard notorious things about this dish before I went and am so pleased I finally sampled it.
The food is extremely well presented and I didn't find the staff at all pretentious. We were treated in exactly the same manner as every other customer and he whole experience was fantastic.
However, you may need to hold back on your eating out for a couple of weeks so save the pennies for Nobu as it is on the more pricey side at around - my main course was around £32 so I decided against an appetiser! Well worth a visit though for something special.",1
5,"The food here is astonishingly good. Service is average at best but who cares when the food is this good. We were here for lunch on Friday and had 5 pieces of Salmon sashimi with wasabi and soy sauce to start. It was great qualify fish. The main course dishes came at intervals after that, which worked quite well as if they had all arrived at the same time it would have been too hard to choose what to have first.
I don't know exactly what we had as we let the clients choose, but first up was a mushroom based dish in a sauce, I couldn't say what else was in it but I've never enjoyed mushrooms on their own more. We also had lobster with asparagus, prawn with asparagus, pork belly and wagyu beef. All great but the pork belly was utter genius, melt in the mouth doesn't do it sufficient justice. I've had the black cod here before and that's the only other thing I remember coming close to the pork belly.
Fuji apple crumble came with peanut in the crumble mix and with hazelnut ice cream. It was very good but I think my taste buds had already been over-excited by that point",1
4,"Fortunately for my wallet, the only time that I have ever visited Nobu was on company expenses. This was also quite fortunate for my taste buds too as we were openly encouraged to order whatever we liked. This meant I was allowed to order their signature Black Cod, guilt free. It was phenomenal. Every flake fell away from the fish effortlessly and the taste was incredible.
The rest of my party thoroughly enjoyed their meals too and whilst it would be fair to say that there is a great emphasis on fish here, the meal lovers and vegetarians were also well catered for. Special mention has to be made of Nobu's skilled presentation. Every dish that you order arrives as a work of art in itself and it's clear that the kitchen are trying very hard to impress.
The downside of Nobu is the celebrity factor. A known haunt for famous faces, it often feels as though this restaurant is more concerned with status than food. While we ate it was hard not to notice a few celebrities being rushed through the dining room in to the private area at the back. If anything I felt this drew more attention to them than if they had just been walked through the restaurant like anyone else.
For most people a visit to Nobu will be a one off and for a special occasion it's definitely worth it. However, the prices here make it difficult for us non-celeb types to really get to know the place and its celebrity status can detract from the food.",1
1,"I have been twice and will not go back.
 The first time the food was excellent but the service was shocking.
 Unfortunately, the service problems were not an anomaly and the second time was just as bad in terms of service.
 There are too many fabulous places in London to eat that also give you a wonderful experience. Don't waste your time or money here.",-1
5,I don't go often (it's very expensive) but when I do I go all out and it's worth it.  Nobu is about quality over quantity.  I've never tasted better sashimi and the black cod is incredible.  Great service is the icing on the cake.,1
5,"I am a non-believer of fusion food, but after trying London Nobu,  my view has been changed.  The Omasake set was just aweson, perfectly awesome, especially any sashimi served with fusion style, it's just so mouth watering.  The spirit was the western source enhancing the sashimi.  of course, the service was splendid.  I went twice in two weeks' time.
btw, the signature dish with Tuna, oh, the best ever!!!",1
4,Melanie and I where in London for the weekend and found Nobu two buildings down from the Holiday Inn we were staying at.  We decided to do the 5 course meal which ended up being very pricey but it gave us a range of their most popular dishes.  Yes the black cod was so tasty!  the service was great and they accepted American Express.  They kept shouting when new customers came so it got annoying after a few times.  The place is a bit dark and the sit you really close to the neighboring diners that you have to whisper if it's a private conversation.  I hear there are some Nobu chains in the US so i will have to try and compare.,1
5,"Nobu is just about every poker player's go to spot for sushi so over the course of the past 20 times I've been I have a list of plates I usually order (plus a few new ones). There are two Nobu locations in London. The one on Berkeley St. is the newer trendy one. The other one is usually used for business meetings and is more family friendly.
Drinks:
Kaffir Lime & Lychee Martini
Appetizers:
Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno
new style white fish (I think this was it) - not as good as the yellowtail, but if you want something different its a nice change
Main Courses (Usually just eat everything family style):
Black Cod with Miso
I don't know the name, but it was steak with mushrooms (was soooooo good, steak melted in my mouth)
Sushi:
Toro (O-toro is the best)
Dessert:
Chocolate bento box - like a chocolate lava cake and green tea ice cream
Mochi - ice cream wrapped in a gummy layer (made of rice I think)
I honestly wouldn't try sushi anywhere else while in London. Nobu = nuts

5,"From the get go I knew this would be an interesting experience. Not accustomed to dining out on this scale I dialled Nobu's reservation desk with some trepidation and held for 35 minutes, only to be told that the first available table for 8 was 6 weeks away. On a Wednesday evening. For the 6:30pm seating (not exactly peak time for celeb spotting). O well.
 After announcing our arrival at the hotel-style reception desk we were guided into the ground floor bar by our elegant, if ever so serious hostess. The dimly-lit bar is something to behold. It is beautifully designed and sitting at the small table I couldn't help but feel like I'd made it. Silly I know.
 Although the service was unremarkable, the food was incredible. I would highly recommend the Wagyu Beef skewers and the King Crab Tempura. Our group had done its research and a few people at the table informed me that it was widely known that the Black Cod was the way to go. What ever you do, don't miss it!",1
3,"I've only had small plates and cocktails at the bar at this Nobo so perhaps it's an unfair comparison, but I like the food at the Park Lane Nobu better. I tried a few of the dishes and was most impressed by the asparagus (and we ordered a fair share of different sea food options). My 'martini' was more like lychee juice with a splash of vodka and I was thoroughly unimpressed by it. It's a good place for people watching but if you're trying to have a conversation, don't sit at one of the tables in the middle, the acoustics are weird and you won't be able to hear what the person a foot in front of you is saying.",-1
4,I've only had drinks and snacks in the lounge but even from that experience I can say this is one very sexy and seductive dining/drinking environment. It's pricey [surprise!] but so what when time and space are shared with a sexy leggy local.,1
4,"save your pennies and savour the delights that be fusion of japanese and south american cuisine.
i will never forget the dessert i had like a sophisticated spring role with warm liquid chocolate that oozed from it.",1
3,"This is the trendier sibling to the Nobu at the Metropolitan. It's more clubby and chic at night, offering good people-watching opportunities in the evening. But I prefer Nobu at the Met. The food is comparable but the Met ambiance is just so much more relaxed and less poseur. And the real celebs know this, anyway, so you're going to find them at the Met branch and not the Berkeley one. Ironically, as I write this, I just had lunch there last week with Noami Campbell sitting at the next table. Which is even more bizarre, given that she was sitting at the table next to me a few nights prior to that when I was eating at China Tang... go figure.... not that she's a gourmet tastemaker but we do seem to like to eat the same things ;)",-1
5,Our dinner at Nobu Berkeley was one of the best meals I have ever eaten!  The lobster tempura is a must order.,1
5,"This is some of the best Indian food I've ever had, even against food from my four trips to India.  The five of us each got our own starter, which we ended up sharing, and then did family style for our main courses.  My favorite was probably the duck vindaloo, though all the curries were fantastic.  Others loved their veg platter.
Cocktails and wine we're also reasonable.  Highly recommend.",1
5,"Veeraswamy is London's longest standing restaurant (since 1926) and it's obvious why it's still around! My husband and I continue to rave about this restaurant and both agree that it was easily our favorite meal during our trip.
The restaurant is located upstairs in a building with a view of Regent Street. You'll check in with the hostess and take the elevator upstairs, where another host will show you to your table. My husband and I opted for the 3 course menu (appetizer, main course, and dessert). We started off with the mulligatawny soup to start, lamb kashmiri and chicken makhani as our entrees, and galub jamun for dessert. Every single item was OFF. THE. CHAIN. All of our dishes were bursting with flavor and there was a smooth balance of spice and savoriness. The meats and the veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly.
The service was very friendly from start to finish. The manager checked up on us, and our server checked up on us frequently, but we never felt like it was overbearing. The hosts were also very friendly to us.
As they are well deserving of their Michelin star, I would highly recommend reservations which can be easily made through OpenTable.",1
5,"Excellent Indian food in London for nearly a century.  Perched above the bustling Regent Street shopping area, it is one restaurant you should be sure to make a reservation well in advance. 
We had two amazing starters, two mains, and several sides.  All of it was exceptional.  Some of the best choices were the Chicken Makhani, Pista Ka Salan, broccoli Bezule, Raj kachori, and Murgh Hazrat.
All staff, including the manager, were helpful and pleasant.  There are numerous very good Indian restaurants in London, but none older or as impressive as this one.",1
2,"Decent food, nothing special, bad service experience.
I show up at 6:00, which is clearly early for London, since most people are still out drinking at some pub for the past 3 hours wallowing about their painful 6 hour work day.
I show up, in casual wear, in track pants, but my friend was wearing ""sweat pants"" and we were told that he could not eat there because they have a dress code.
really?  track pants are ok, but sweat pants isn't?  it's also 6 pm there were only 3 tables of people eating, are they really going to notice?  
I bet if I was indian or the viscount of donkey kong country ther would make an exception for me",-1
4,"BIAS as this is a memory place for me. But the service is still awesome and there is nothing wrong with the food. Is it authentic, cheap or edgy. No. But it's still very classy. It  is still yummy. But?! if you don't have a history here, there is little reason to start one.",1
5,"We visited Veeraswamy for lunch as a recommendation from a friend. We've dined at plenty of Indian restaurants in the states but was promised that this would be different. I must say, this was one of the most unique Indian food experiences I've had. This restaurant delivered elevated Indian cuisine, even for lunch. Flavors were explosive, fresh and the meats and seafoods were cooked perfectly. Prices are a little higher than most, but I think it's definitely worthwhile. No doubt one of the best out there.",1
5,"London's longest standing Indian restaurant is holding the title for a damn good reason. My mouth may never be the same. 
Ok, 1st thing - your entrance into the place is strange. The restaurant is on the second floor, but the hostess stand is on the ground level. You check in, and they send you to an elevator, up to the restaurant. The whole thing gives this Hong Kong Fuey kinda vibe.
Pampered by the red carpet service of 5-Star Indian cuisine in an elegant room overlooking a streetwide parade protesting fox-hunting... well, that's how it was the day we went!!!
I ordered the ""tasting menu"" or whatever they called it, and each bite was better than the previous. An amazing chicken app and the most astounding prawn ever preceded my main course: a flight of curries.
AAAAHHHHHHHH!!! (Light shines down from above and I begin weeping).
Seriously, this food will ruin Indian food for me for years, cuz there's NO WAY it's going to be this good any time soon. Sorry, everywhere else.",1
4,"I came here alone on my first night in London, having seen it has a Michelin star.  Basically they get very high marks for service, you are served by at least 5 different people, all wanting you to have a great experience.  The manager came over more than once to check in as well.
I ordered the Raj Kachori, one of their signature appetizers.  It was delightful but quite large and filling.  It featured a crispy phyllo-like bowl with pomegranate and other fruit and nuts.  The dressings had an overpoweringly sweet note to them and almost drowned out the rest of the flavors, but overall the dish was quite good.  There was enough spice in the green dressing to make the dish interesting.  I had never had anything like it before.
Then on to the spicy chicken thighs which were not very spicy at all, so I was disappointed about that, but the flavors were very good and very classic.  The sauce was quite rich and thick.  I had a side of tempura-fried vegetables which were as spicy as the main dish!  Lots of cumin and coriander. I was stuffed.  All in all a great experience.",1
5,"We wanted to try Indian in London and this place was amazing! Excellent service. Lovely atmosphere. We shared the non/veg starter platter -OMG - delicious, with prawns the favorite of the three. Dinner was a lamb shank wrapped in phyllo with an exquisite marrow sauce. Oldest Indian restaurant in London. Enjoy!",1
5,For sure the better of all London Indian restaurants that is why I give it a 5 Star. Extraordinary dishes the lentils just die for with unbelievable chicken dishes.,1
5,"A colleague of.mine had recommended this place and so I decided to pay a visit. Reservations are essential here as I discovered that this restaurant had 1 Michelin star to it's name. I had dined at Quillon on a previous London trip so it was nice to have the chance to compare 2 London based Michelin started Indian restaurants.
It was fortunate that I had a reservation as the restaurant seats about 40 and there were only a few tables for 1-2. The restaurant was about 30% full when I arrived at 6.30 but it slowly filled up. I was seated promptly after I exited from the elevator on the first floor. The decor of the restaurant is traditional Indian with some modern touches. Definitely more traditional than Quillon.
I decided to order 2 dishes that were on the original 1926 menu: mulligatawny soup and the lamb briyani. These are quintessential Indian dishes as well. Unlike previous reviews, both dishes did not lack flavor in the least. Certainly the lamb briyani was as spicy as anything I have ever tasted in India, Singapore or Malaysia. The mulligatawny soup had a nice flavor, with good balance and interesting texture from the rice and onions in the soup. The lamb briyani was of a good portion size - enough for 2 to share. The lamb was tender and flavorful and the basmati rice was soft, fluffy and just sufficiently moist without clumping. 
At the end of the meal, I was too full to have dessert so I had to skip that but there were a number of good options available, both Indian and non-Indian. The restaurant also had a very good wine list and drink list.
The service, I must say, was very attentive and warm, in keeping with the Michelin starred restaurants I have been to. I was attended by the main and assistant waiter and the supervisor also checked in twice to see how the food was. 
Comparing to Quillon, I would say come to Veerasamy for more traditional Indian style food and surroundings. I would say Quillon is a more contemporary Indian restaurant with a more modern interpretation of Indian cuisine. It's probably more accessible to Western or British palates as well. Both restaurants shined where it came to their drink and wine list and service. Price wise - they're similar though Quillon had smaller portion sizes. If you have the chance and the funds, I would say try both!",1
5,"There are few Indian restaurants with a Michelin star. That is too bad. But I know Veeraswamy deserves its. 
I went for lunch and ordered a ""mocktail,"" something more restaurants should be doing. The basil and apple juice mocktail was one of the most exquisite nectars that I have ever put to my lips.
I am so thankful for the kindness shown to me and the great food. I will never fail to go here when I return to London. This is THE place (the definite article if you will) for inspired Indian food in the heart of London.",1
5,Undoubtedly the finest Indian food I've ever had. I tried various Indian restaurants in London over the years but this one is surely a cut above the rest. The naan!!!!!,1
4,"Beautiful location, ambiance and great food to go with it. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Veeraswamy. 
From the tandoori fiery chicken, to the Pani Puri, veggies, biryani and naan, this was high end indian in a traditional menu. 
While we used to have a habit of Quilon in St James' I think from now on, it is Veeraswamy.",1
5,"No wonder this place is Michelin rated. The service was exceptional. We went with our children and they were very accommodating in helping us find options they thought the kids would like. We had a show to catch and we asked if they could seat us sooner. They were able to seat us one hour earlier. Now to the food. What can I say, not one bad thing on the table. But the highlight for me was the starter Raj Kachori. It was puff pastry filled with heaven. It was like a work of art, I didn't want to eat it. Anyway, everything else was up to par with all then reviews. Recommend for lunch or evening.",1
4,Excellent. Unquestionably some of the best Indian food I've eaten. Clearly they have handle on both service a food preparation. It should be made clear that this may kit be the style of Indian food you are used to. It's a good idea to check the menu first.,1
4,"I came here for dinner time with my parents and it was really good
The place itself it's really nice and cosy. I love the pictures on the wall about the glorious past of this place and their prestigious guests.
We ordered different starters to share : mango salad, chicken tikka and crab cake with some mix of naan ( chili, garlic and plain). It was good and really taste.
Then we ordered three different kind of lambs : lamb biryani, Kashmiri Rogan Josh and a royal Indian lamb recipe.
Everything was really delicious and spicy. The food was high quality and the quantity was really big !
We had a wonderful time there, the service was really good as well
If you are looking for a fancy Indian place, I totally recommend it ( even if it's a bit pricy )",1
5,"The aroma hits you before you even step foot onto the elevator.  You take a one story trip up and the friendliest of faces is there to greet you.  We were immediately escorted to our seats and then the journey really began!
I started with a cocktail and ordered the ""1926, A Tribute to Veeraswamy.""  The mix of Prosecco, Midori, and Finlandia was brilliantly done.  So tasty.
I ordered the lamb shank and, just, wow.  Seriously, this might be the tastiest meal I have ever been lucky enough to have in front of me.  The lamb shank was slow cooked for six hours, wrapped in a puff pastry, and served with a marrow sauce.  The meat was so unbelievably flavorful and tender.  I used my fork to cut through the pastry and the meat.  Adding that extra bit of flavor with the marrow sauce sent this meal through the roof!
We added a side of rice and some naan to round out the meal.  We had two drinks, two meals, and two sides for roughly £80.  Can't beat that meal for that price.  Make the time to visit this establishment!",1
3,"Known as the oldest Indian restaurant in London, I knew I had to check it out during my latest visit. And while it was surely delectable and the setting was gorgeous (on the second floor of one of London's oldest shopping districts), the food was good--but not great. The portions were certainly generous, but the flavors themselves I found a little lacking. Granted, I visited for lunch so perhaps it was not their best work, but I would have to say I've found better in the US (such as Rasika in DC).",-1
5,"I will never stop reminiscing this experience! I am so glad we were able to get in while we were in town.
I will admit that I was jealous of my boyfriends meal and perhaps ate more if his food than of my own .  My dish was very well prepared.  The chicken was juicy and not over cooked.  The sauce was tasty as well. I thoroughly enjoyed their naan as well.
The service was outstanding.  We were greeted at the door, at the front desk, and almost as soon as we were seated.  Our waiter consistently checked in and we never wanted for anything.  If you get the opportunity to try this place out its worth the money!!",1
4,"One can't travel to London without eating in at least one Indian restaurant as I believe they have some of the best Indian restaurants in the world. There are in fact so many that it made deciding where to eat a challenge, but after scouring reviews and asking local friends for their opinions, we landed on Veeraswamy.
You enter on the ground floor and take an elevator up to the restaurant which features authentic Indian decor. With so many amazing dishes to choose from we asked our friendly, attentive and helpful waiter for advice.
We started with the Raj Kachori which was artfully presented as its a large wheat puri filled with goodies. It was delicious. We also had the Angara Chicken Tikka which came with spicy boneless chicken thigh pieces smoked with garam masala and mace; and lastly, we shared the Tandoori green paws which were light and flavorful served in a coriander, mint, chili sauce.
For our main dishes we had the Kerala prawn curry. The prawns were served in a coconut curry that was slightly spicy. We also has the Hyderabadi Nimboo Dopiaza which featured a large portion of chicken breasts served in a spicy sauce with lim, chili and cumin; and lastly, we had the Hyderabadi Lamb Biryani which has subtly spiced and has apparently been on the menu since 1926.
All of the dishes were delicious and cooked perfectly. The only thing I would change is to order less chicken dishes and one less appetizer.  The restaurant met my high expectations and I would definitely go back.",1
3,"High end in many ways: decor, service and price. Food just wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped
Green Prawn starter (3.5/5) - it was a good size prawn but there were only two. It tastes fine
Patiala Shahi Raan Lamb shank (3/5) - it was huge and cooked in a puff pastry. The meat itself was tender but not very flavorful. The sauce was nice but still not as potent as I was hoping for.
It's possible my mistake was not getting a more curry based dish. 
The service was fantastic. Not sure what it says about me that I would have preferred Dishoom",-1
5,I was never a huge fan of Indian cuisine but for some reason was craving for Indian food that rainy day. This one was rated high and claimed to be the oldest Indian restaurant in town so we went for it. Our decision turned out rather rewarding. The curry was amazing. We had the lamp and prawn cooked in different curries. They sorta made my day and kept my stomach warm for the rest of whole night. We received nice service. The environment was quite decent as well. A strong recommend to whoever is in mood for a bowl of hearty.,1
5,"Amazing Indian food, great service! Would highly recommend the duck vindaloo and chicken makhani! Hope to be able to travel to London to eat there again!",1
3,"The restaurant setting is lovely and the lighting is low. The dress is casual, however when we were there it was definitely on the more dressy side. The menu is fairly straightforward with a lot of chicken thigh dishes. The minimum charge is 40 pounds per person as stated on their menu. The food was food was good, but not exceptional. Though this may be the oldest Indian cuisine restaurant in London (90 years), it is not the best Indian cuisine restaurant in London.",-1
3,"food not as good as it was years ago.
the daal was good and the prawns as starts was ok
Biriyani no so impressive",-1
1,"Don't bother with this place. They take reservations and never once say you cannot bring kids (mine are close to 6 and 10). We had this reservation to do dinner coming from Boston. I have taken my most well behaved kids to Mori Motto's, Michelin star restaurants and never once have been turned down. Basically have the curtsy to say that on you website. Manager had the gall to tell me he will recommend some other place. Thanks but no thanks we are foodies, we don't take recommendations from you. Very rude staff.",-1
2,"With high prices come high expectations; unfortunately, Veeraswamy did not live up to them.
The hostess initially refused to seat us by the windows (even though the place was half empty) but that was quickly remedied by someone who overruled her.  And the restaurant is beautiful and well-ventilated so we didn't come out smelling like curry.  
After some hemming and hawing on our part, I decided on the pear and cinnamon martini and my friend got the guava and passion fruit martini.  Neither of us particularly enjoyed our drinks.
I started with the raj kochuri, which V describes as a ""large wheat puri filled with goodies, splashed with chutneys.""  I had never had anything quite like it before and thought it was pretty good.  I had a taste of the sholay chicken and it was very flavorful.
My entree was the lamb shank and it came out looking delicious and smelling wonderful.  But I took my first bite and realized that it lacked seasoning -- such a shame.  My friend actually asked the server to bring salt, and that is a first at an Indian restaurant.
I had the caramelized banana kulfir dessert and it was pretty good.  But I'm not spending 40+ pounds on lunch for ""pretty good.""",-1
5,"The best Indian food I've ever had. Definitely pay a visit here if you're in London. Worth every penny. Cocktails were just ok, but the food was so phenomenal that it still deserves five stars.",1
1,"Don't eat here!  Food is very mediocre, service is awkward, and it's incredibly expensive.  High price to pay for food poisoning.",-1
5,"Yes. It is the best Indian in service, ambiance, and nourishment.  If you have to ask the price don't.  Enjoy the experience.",1
5,"Possibly one of the best places in London. Located right in the heart of Regent Street. Decor is great, service is good and food is awesome. Whatever you choose, the taste of it will be different from your typical Indian. Quite pricey too. Between my wife and I, for a 3 course dinner it set us almost £200 but that included a couple of great drinks. Would defiantly recommend for a special occasion as it really does live up to its moto, 'one of the three best' places in town",1
5,"Nice ambiance and excellent service. I'm not a huge fan of Indian food but this place is making me reconsider. Lunch was fantastic. The lamb was very flavorful and so was the pineapple curry, which I was somewhat skeptical of initially. I would definitely check it out again, maybe for dinner.",1
4,"I haven't eaten a lot of Indian food, but our London friends thought this would be a lovely place to eat on our first night in London.  I am not entirely sure what I had, we joked it was the hardest thing to pronounce, but it was delicious.  It was chicken in a sauce.  I started with the crab cake and that was also delicious.  The pineapple curry was a hit with the whole table.  The restaurant is lovely inside with a beautiful view of Picadilly Circus.",1
5,"Very old school Indian restaurant. A++ for service and food was excellent. As a vegetarian, there were many options to choose from.",1
5,"This was hands down the best Indian restaurant I have ever dined at. The food was absolutely perfect alone with the drinks and the service. It isn't cheap but I challenge anybody to find a finer Indian restaurant on the planet. 
They are VERY busy in the summer time so I suggest that a reservation be made if you plan on eating during the peak dinner hour.",1
5,"It's hardly surprising that all of the best Indian meals I've had have been in London, even include some Michelin starred meals. But Veeraswamy may well be the best of the best.
I was actually not expecting it to be quite that good, because the opentable listing emphasizes their corporate connections, plus a recommendation by National Geographic(?!) 
Yet everything we tried was one of the best Indian dishes I've tasted, and we tried quite a few items, sampling four appetizers and a vegetarian main that included four separate dishes. Particular highlights were the Raj Kachori, a fancy version of Indian street food consisting of a crisp wheat puri filled with goodies, and Scallop Moilee, which came in a stunning coconut and ginger sauce. My wife is a Chicken Tikka aficionado, and proclaimed this one the best Indian dish she ever tasted.
There is also an excellent wine list, highlighted by some very well-described white and red Burgundies.
This will definitely be the Indian restaurant we return to on our next visit to London.",1
4,"Yummy food! The chicken biryani is so tasty.. the food is not as ""oily"" as other Indian restaurants i've tried.. tip: come hungry",1
5,"we had the chicken biryani, potatotes, daal. The biryani was amazing . Eating the food at veeraswamy is like watching Rekha in Umrao Jaan if you know what I mean. The drinks were very interesting and flavorful. So glad we came here!",1
4,"Gorgeous space and a little pricey. However since we were near the Piccadilly area this was a close place to pop into. Great food, very attentive service and warm ambiance.",1
3,"Ordered the Raj Kachori, papadam, duck curry, prawn curry, veggie main course platter (daal, Gobi aaloo, kofta, and paneer). Malbec wine and amazingggggg mirchi martini -- nothing worth recommending other than yup - you guessed it - the mirchi martini :)",-1
4,"A friend had told us about this place almost a year ago and we finally got around to trying it! Although a bit pricey, the service, food, and ambiance were great. You enter on Swallow St. and check-in with someone before heading up the elevator to the 1st floor. It was more spacious than we expected and they also looked to have a private room upstairs.
The chicken lollipops were juicy and wonderful served on chicken bones. The chicken / lamb kebaps were just okay. We loved the chicken tikka and  the spicy prawn curry too! Great flavors and giant fresh prawns!!",1
5,"Came here for a business dinner. Asked to be served ""family style"" so we could share a little bit of everything. Everything was great. You only need one order of rice for 2-3 people, but it has to be ordered separately. 
The ambiance and service was great and I would definitely recommend.",1
5,"Some of the best Indian cuisine ever, ever, ever.  *of course including mom's cooking in there*
Veeraswamy. Regent street.  Enter@ Swallow Street, London. Beautiful company and amazing food. Indian cuisine, truly elevated. Try the Badami chicken.",1
1,"They are definitely feelin' themselves. Don't be a fool and buy the hype. Your money is better spent at Roti Chai (downstairs dining area). It took them 30 min, at least, to serve us water. When we asked the waitress about it, she blamed it on the bus boy. The food was decent, but not worth the 200 bucks we spent there. I ordered the homemade organic paneer, layered with green herbs and green mango, and finished off with nutmeg and cardamom. Very good. My cocktail was decent, but still pretty sweet (although the waitress smirked when I asked for it not to be too sweet, and said, ""Oh no, it's not sweet at all""). Wrong. I had the veggie crescent platter, and the only standout was the paneer tikka masala. Even then, it wasn't nearly as good as the veggie dishes we had the previous night at Roti Chai.
One last thing, we asked for naan to accompany our takeaway (we figured we should take our leftovers for a late night snack, since we'd forked over $200 for them). The waitress seriously went into a 5 minute explanation about how it would taste chewy if we reheated it later and she didn't recommend it. Lame. Give us what we ordered, we are paying for it.
She then brought the naan out 10 minutes later, on a plate, as if we were going to eat it there. She explained, ""I brought it out like this because the chef gets upset if people order takeaway, but I can pack it now bc it's been served"". WTF. Who says that? Doesn't the client always come first?
She never came back to give us our check. We had to ask the bus boy for it, so that we could GTFO.
Suck it, Veeraswamy.",-1
1,"What an incredible disappointment.
This was possibly the most pompous and underwhelming restaurant to which I've ever been.  
The problems started with our cocktails, which even after requesting they not be made sweet, came out as if they were made with tablespoons of sugar.  Gross.  The waitress' condescension began here, by the way, with her arrogant proclamation (when we ordered) that the drinks were not made anyway but perfectly.  Yeah, whatever. They tasted like drinks teenagers would drink.  Amateurish.
Our appetizers were a mixed affair.  The herb paneer was excellent; the softest cheese scented with nutmeg and cardamom.  The crab cake however was dry and flavorless, it tasted like chewing seafood sandpaper.  How do you screw up a crab cake?
At this point, 20 mins later, still no water as requested when we ordered our drinks.
Our entrees arrive.  Again, a mixed affair.  The chicken tikka was good, not great; a solid blend of sweet and smoky spices.  The saag however was dismal, it tasted like spinach run through a blender and slopped on a plate without any seasoning. It was inedible.  My wife's veggie platter was so-so, a couple dishes were good, the aubergine was poor.   
But at least our water now had arrived! Small victory.  But at the end of our meal pretty much, accompanied by an apology from our waitress who blamed the bar. For the 30 min delay -for water.  Nice.
Last, and this would fall under the insult to injury category, we asked for the remaining food to be packed to go except for the spinach and aubergine, and requested the addition of a naan. I then had to hear a lecture on how naan is not meant to be taken away and how would it rot in daylight or to another's touch outside the restaurant and (this part is no exaggeration) the chef gets very mad if patrons do takeaway. 
Are you fucking kidding me? I couldn't believe how arrogant and pompous this waitress was.  Who cares what the fucking chef thinks, it's a piece of naan! 
Please pass this on to the chef and to the owner: if the food was as made carefully and service as half as polished as you manicure your inflated sense of ego, you'd be getting more than 1 star.  And put a Kevlar vest around the chef's delicate heart and tell them the spinach and crab cake sucked ass. 
So many other places we've been to like Roti Chai and Dishoom outclass this place in terms of food quality and service, skip this place and spend your money elsewhere.  What a waste of time, money, and patience.",-1
5,"I was on a business trip in London this past May and had a friend come visit me during the second week I was there. The one thing we really wanted to eat was good Indian food. I had gotten recommendations from a few coworkers, both of which recommended Amaya, a sister restaurant to Veeraswamy, which was actually recommended to my friend by someone else.
We arrived at Veeraswamy at approximately 7:30 PM on Wednesday night, sans reservation. To our surprise, there were no tables available and the earliest reservation we could make was for 9:30. We decided to put our name down and and go grab some drinks at a nearby pub. The restaurant is in a nice area of the city, near lots of shops (which were unfortunately closed by that time of the evening) and restaurants, so we didn't have to go far to find another place to hang out. After having a couple of drinks, we decided to go back to the restaurant at around 8:45. We were able to wait in their upstairs lounge, which was actually just a few small tables near a bench, until our table was ready. We each ordered a glass of wine which was brought to us promptly. Luckily for us, coming back early was a good choice because we were seated about 5 minutes later! 
The restaurant was beautifully decorated and had a vibrant color scheme that reminded me a lot of India (I'm part Indian). We studied the menu after being seated and finally decided what we wanted. Our waiter took our order and we anxiously awaited for our dishes to arrive. The service was great throughout the night, even though the restaurant was filled to capacity when we sat down to eat. We started our meal with the green herb paneer tikka, which was made up of homemade paneer with various herbs and spices. The paneer was the right consistency and went perfectly with the herbs. For our main course, we ordered the Kerala prawn curry and the tandoori raan. The prawn curry was full of flavor and had the right amount of spice. I had never had a Kerala style curry before, but it's made with coconut milk and therefore reminded me of a Thai red curry more than a traditional Indian curry. The tandoori raan was probably our favorite dish, which was a slow cooked lamb shank in a garam masala infused cashew sauce. The meat was tender and fell apart easily. The sauce was incredible - I would have drunk it if that was socially acceptable. Instead, I resorted to pouring it over my rice. We also ordered naan and some saag (an Indian creamed spinach of sorts) to accompany our meal, both which were also very good. I think we forced ourselves to finish all the food we ordered, despite being full, because it was that amazing. We couldn't not have dessert, so we order the gulab jamun, which is a traditional Indian milk-based dessert. The dessert came with ice cream and a raspberry sauce. It was very good, but I think I prefer the more traditional version of the dessert served in most Indian restaurants. 
If I am ever back in London, I would not hesitate to visit Veeraswamy again (or maybe try one of its sister restaurants). This really was a dinner to remember!",1
4,"the food and ambiance were really good , but its tooooo expansive nothing so special about it , i did eat in another restaurant the same tasty food but for less money",1
4,"Lunch at Veeraswamy last Saturday.  According to its sign, it is the oldest Indian restaurant in London.  For those deciding what to order, try the Raj Kachori (a large poori filled with lentils, yogurt and chutney) and especially, the Patiala Shahi Raan (a very generous portion of lamb shank cooked inside a pastry-puff like covering).  The lamb, and its accompany sauce, was excellent!",1
4,"So nice to get authentic Indian cuisine.
I ate with family (3 Indians) and they loved the food. Always nervous offering guests their local food but you are safe here, it is authentic.
Prawn main course for dinner was super, dahls, rice and veg dishes all great.
Again found breads to be the weak link here. Having lived in India for 6 years I do not feel the parathas, especially, were good, doughy possibly undercooked.
Great experience, lovely atmosphere and authentic Indian cuisine.",1
4,"This was my first, fancy Indian restaurant in London.  I had the slow-cooked lamb shank, which was really good, and my bf had the chicken curry.  Both were pretty good (especially the lamb), but they were pretty pricey as well.  I think reservations for this place is a must. The venue is fancy and high-class, but service was only so-so.  Not sure if our waitress was new or her English was not very good.",1
5,"Delicious indian food and a calm place to dine, their best starter is raj kachori, so delicious and unusual. The service is good and the waiters are friendly.",1
5,Totally impressed . Lives up to all the hype :) . The chicken tikka was the best I have ever had ! Like even better than what you get in India ! Staff is very courteous . You don't mind spending here as the food and ppl both are amazing !,1
4,"Small group out for dinner.  Started with raj kachori... was nice (almost southwest) spice and flavor and enjoyed the crunch.  For dinner we had chicken makhani, nimboo dopyaza, and kerala prawn curry.  The presentation was lovely and the food did not disappoint.  The dopyaza was nice and spicy with great texture.  The service was fast and pleasant.",1
2,"Ridiculously expensive. I mean more than you think, much more!
We spent over £200 for 3 people, and the food was average, at least I thought it was. One of my guests thought the food was good. Either way, I won't be going back.",-1
5,"A friend of mine recommended this restaurant when I was in London. I tried various Indian restaurants in the States but this is the best I've ever had! From the main dishes to the exotic deserts, it's one of my all time favorites. 
Food: 10/10
Atmosphere: 10/10
Service: 10/10",1
1,"This avery good food quality but but & but people who manage the reception are not polite at all just now one of them said ""leave my restaurant ""for one of the customer .
Hope some one look after this problem in this restaurant.",-1
5,"1st time here and couldn't be happier! Our last day in London before flying home to the States and we wanted to eat Indian cuisine, this place advertises itself as the oldest Indian restaurant in Europe so thought we'd give it a try. Great location in Regent Street, nice looking restaurant, great service and outstanding food...what more could you ask for?? A little more expensive than I'd usually pay but well worth it!!",1
4,"There isn't much to say about Veeraswamy that hasn't already been said. If you haven't been here, you need to go. Period. The ambience is over the top opulent in the oldest of English Indian traditions (Veeraswamy is apparently the oldest Indian restaurant in London, which is saying a lot). The food is a mix of traditional (their chicken tikka is outstanding) and an ever changing variety of new takes and interesting variations. There are plenty of options for vegetarians as well. The cocktails are an unexpected highlight. Go to Veeraswamy for the food and the decor, but expect to pay as it doesn't come cheap.",1
4,"Very well done Indian restaurant with long history in London - we had dinner reservations here at around 845pm and were seated right away. We got the prawn curry, a vegetarian curry and a paneer starter with some dal and okra. The dal and okra for me were the star of the show. I hadn't tasted such authentic food since I was in India (currently live in Hong Kong) - I really enjoyed all of the dishes. Interestingly enough, the much touted prawn curry was the most average to me. The highlight was ending the meal with tea which had been described in a very wine like fashion (and also served in wine glasses) - classy touch to a lovely meal",1
4,"Recommended by a foodie friend. Went with my gf. Opted for business lunch for 2 course 27 pounds each. Chicken tikka was very tender and well spiced without going overboard. Duck was also well marinated and sliced in more gentle manner however the meat want too tender as of it was a bit over cooked. Halibut was very good. The spice was not too curried but more fragrant. The lamb chop was good but I was more amazed by the squash underneath. Very tender and flavorful. Kudos to the chef and the good service by the staff. Still it's a bit over priced for me, although considering the location and history it might make sense.",1
5,Brilliant! This is the oldest Indian restaurant in London.  It was recommended to me during a business trip in Albuquerque of all places.  It pays to talk to your neighbors at the bar.  I have eaten here twice and both experiences were great. Their cocktails are amazing-the combination of flavors and aromatics cannot be duplicated. I seem to always order lobster when I dine at Indian places in London.  They just know how to cook lobster like no other group!  It's located close to many theaters. Reservations are a must here.,1
5,"We had the four course tasting menu with Lobster Masala, Chicken Makhani, Lamb Rogan Josh and Pineapple Curry, that included a lamb and prawn starter and a chocolate mousse dessert. My daughter had the four course vegetarian tasting menu, and my son a chicken dish ala carte. All the food was very well executed with great flavor and proper spice. The service was impeccable, and the window view of Regent St added to the regal ambiance. I also recommend that you try the cocktails. I had a Vesper martini, which was perfect.",1
3,"Nice Indian restaurant with a not quite matching relation between price and service. Where the service itself is ok, but the food quality, that is got, does not really match the price given. I don't understand why you order Indian food and have to order the rise or nan bread in addition. At least a portion of rise should come with the food.
So after all you feel a little cheated, though the quality is ok.
The overall feeling in the restaurant is very good.",-1
5,The best Indian food I ever ate. Wowzers!!! Authentic Indian so tasty and the flavors of the food are to die for. Highly recommend must try in London.,1
3,"We did quite a bit of research and wanted to go to an Indian restaurant with some history in London. This certainly fit the bill. It also recently received a Michelin star. Coming from a place in the US that is chock full of good Indian options (SE Michigan), I had high hopes for the city that my British friends claim is the ""best place for Indian in the world"". The place is very classy, with a nice address in Piccadilly Circus. The interior decor is rich with hints of Indian accents. We ordered a number of items from the menu including the mango avocado salad, the crab ginger soup, the vegetarian platter, and the shrimp curry. I asked if they had paratha, which they did not. Fine, we'll have the roti. The roti featured exactly one piece for 5 pounds. I thought we'd have at least two pieces for that price! Our appetizers were good, but the crab was non-existant in the crab ginger soup. It was mostly just ginger soup with a few tiny scraps of crab meat. The veggie appetizer came in bowls that yielded a spoonful or two of food. The spinach ball dish in the platter with almond dressing was most interesting, but gone in two bites. The shrimp curry was fine, but nothing memorable. At the end, with no alcohol, our tab for two was 125 pounds. I could eat for a week of Indian food for that. Had it been great, I would have been able to justify the price. But the miserly portions, unremarkable dishes, combined with the long wait between the appetizer and mains, makes this s a first and last visit for us.",-1
5,I could hop on a plane from Los Angeles and fly to London just to go eat there again. Literally fly down go eat there and go back to airport and fly back. Food is next level amazing. Excellent service and excellent ambiance. Right on Regent street above Jo Malone store and steps away from Piccadilly Circus.,1
5,"Wow.  First time at the restaurant and it made sense to do the tasting menu.  I don't regret that one bit.  The service was impeccable, and the tasting menu had items from various Indian culinary backgrounds, with paired wines.  Overall...unbelievable!
Of the tasting menu, the two standouts were the pineapple curry -- chunks of pineapple in warm yogurt gravy with bits of chili, fried mustard seed, and fried curry leaves.  OMG -- amazing.  Single best moment of my meal.  In fact, I told the people serving me that I was upset that I left that dish for the last!  The second dish -- the coconut creme brulee.  Again, OMG.  Creme brulee crust was perfect, and the custard itself had a good balance of sweet goodness with the savory coconut.
Every aspect of the operation, from the person greeting you at the door, to the person taking you to your seat, to the servers taking care of you, all the way to the food prepared and presented is unified under a banner of high standards and quality.  That's why Veeraswamy gets five stars in my book.  Thank you for setting the bar high for standards and quality, and meeting them Veeraswamy!  
Will I be back?  But of course.  Next time, I'm getting a larger order of that pineapple curry.  Thank you for the experience, Veeraswamy!",1
1,Took my parents for their anniversary. Staff were very slow - took them 30 min to take our order and then even longer to serve us water. Manager came and apologised at end and offered to half the service charge - I said no I want it removed completely as this is horrible for a 5 star restaurant where we have paid 200 quid.. not worth food either - short menu nothing stands out and I wish we had gone to Gymkhana - much better service and you get what you pay for.,-1
5,"The food is delicious, the service impeccable. The menu keeps changing, so you are never bored. Languages from all over the world can be heard here. All sorta of people, but united in flavors. I stop here every time I'm in London. I recommend you do, too.",1
5,"My husband and I went to Veeraswarmy this past weekend and it was perfect - the service, the food - everything was perfect.  It is definitely a special night out, as the prices are not cheap, but that will not stop me from going back again.
We started with a cocktail (prosecco for me and a martini for my husband) and then split a bottle of wine for dinner.
For an appetizer, we split the Raj Kachori that was described as ""street food filled with goodies"" -and wow, it was filled with deliciousness - it was a hard shell with some yogurt, curry and garnished with pomegranate seeds - I am not doing this plate justice - just get it!
We each got an entrée - my husband chose the duck and I went with the Lamb shank.  Both we delicious and we had the Pineapple Curry as a side - which really cooled down my mouth after the duck which was a little spicy.  The lamb shank was perfectly braised and fell off the bone just as the menu said.
We finished the meal by splitting a dessert -it was the first one listed on the menu and didn't have a great description - but when we asked the waitress what it was -  she said it was a warm donut filled with sugar - so we immediately chose that and did not regret it.
Service was fantastic with multiple wait staff helping you and the atmosphere was relaxed yet a little fancy.  (We wore jeans, nice shoes and sweaters for a Monday night - if I went during the weekend, I probably would get dressed up a little more. ) 
All in all - the above meal was $270 (USD) but I think totally worth it - -",1
5,"This establishment is in my top 5 best meals that I've ever had in my life. It's a little pricey, but I'd go again and again and again. Absolutely mouthwatering, perfect preparation, you must eat here.",1
5,"Amazing! We went with a group of 10 and sampled each other's foods - by the end of the meal we had hit a majority of Indian stated. Highlights include raj kachuri, a puff of pastry filled with sweet and savory treats (vegetarian), Kerala prawn curri (our group included two guys from Banglor who confirmed this was the best they had ever had - I loved the blend of sweet coconut and spicy curry simmered to perfection) and the kofta was also superb. The vegetarian sampler is an excellent option (includes the kofta). My only complaint was that the lamb dishes were dry (solved that with some of the Kerala sauce). A nice environment, pricey but worth the experience.",1
5,"Tricky to find this restaurant on Swallow St, just off Regent near where the kiddies line-up to get into the Piccadilly Hollister store. There's a purple doorway that leads to an elevator that carries you upstairs to the restaurant.
Very expensive and, never having been to India, the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to and I've been to a lot. 
Excellent service, too. Bring lots of money. Dinner was about 80 BSP per person.",1
5,"While vacationing in London for 5 days, we found ourselves dining TWICE at Veeraswarmy. If you like curry, this is the place to go. It was the BEST Indian food we ever had!! It's location was perfect to the Piccadilly Underground.",1
4,"The oldest Indian restaurant in London has had plenty of time to perfect a thing or two, and the meal that we enjoyed was of very high quality. 
Apart from the beautiful setting and attentive service, our Vegetable Bhajia starter was the highlight of the meal... think of a mouth watering Indian-style tempura (Bell Peppers, Green Beans, Onions, Broccoli) as opposed to the fritters normally served in restaurants. I had a gorgeously presented Coconut Chicken dish for my main, prepared with a spicy korma-esque sauce and garnished with a spicy chilli on top. With a generous bread basket on the side, I found that even absent sides, I was more than stuffed by the end and even passed on dessert. For vegetarians, the Crescent Platter offers a plethora of choices, though the Daal dish stood out compared to the others. In the opinion of my wife (who is a veggie), these were some of the very best lentils in London.
The quality and location come with a price tag, and while not shocked by the total of our meal - it was relatively punchy: 10-15 GBP for starters, 20-35 GBP for mains, with sides also running closer to 10 GBP than to 5. Throw in a few drinks, and the bill can start to add up pretty quickly...",1
5,"Expensive for sure.   I have never paid so much for an Indian meal.  That said, I can't say I've ever had one quite as good either.   The duck was fantastic and the vegetarian sampler was one choice better than the other.   Folks who are complaining about this place are just picking on it due to the price.  The food is amazing.  I typically avoid desert in Indian restaurants.   Not here.  Both my wife and I had delicious deserts to top off a great meal.   
We were at a table for 2 in a row of tables for 2.  Usually I can't stand this since I feel I'm eating with the couples to my sides.  Here the tables were far enough apart (a good 2 feet two either side) that I didn't get that feeling at all.  A nice change that made the meal all that more enjoyable.
Will return!",1
5,"This is my second favorite Indian restaurant in the world.  It's owned by the same people as my favorite Indian restaurant, Chutney Mary.
Whereas Chutney Mary strikes you with its creativity, Veeraswamy is more traditional, but it has the same high quality ingredients, flawless consistency and tasty flavors as its sister restaurants.
1) Start with the tandoor.  I typically have one of 3 starters - the Tandoori Red Snapper, the tandoori shrimp (which has a green spice but I don't know what it's called), and the lamb seekh kebab.  All of them are superb.  The tandoori Red Snapper is my favorite.  Its done just right.   Crispy at the edges, very soft on the inside, and the black pepper spices are spicy enough to be tasty but you can still taste the freshness of the snapper.
2) There are so many great curries here.  You can't go wrong.   My fvaorites are the Kashmiri Rogan Josh, the Lobster Malabar, and the Chicken Tikka masala.
3) You can order vegetarian dishes by the half portion here - which is great because you can have a good variety of sides at the table.  I like the paneer saag, the eggplants, and the dal.
4) The best desert is the black gulab jamun served in rose sauce with ice-cream.  I love that dish.  The chocolate kulfi is great in concept but no great in reality.
5) Really nice space.  Classy upscale decor.  View of Regent's street which is nice in December.  Excellent service.",1
2,I was told this was one of the best restaurants in London. However it seems to be the most expensive but the food is mediocre at best. All dishes tastes bland and not what you would expect. The decor is now dated and paying this sort of money you would at least expect a clean table cloth. I did enjoy the beetroot dish which was very nice and the staff extremely good but the food does not live up to the hype.,-1
4,"Tasty, but does it merit the price tag? Methinks not.
Best dishes:
- Green curry prawns (large, delicious - however the appetizer only comes with 2 prawns)
- Pineapple curry (sweet, but with a little kick - this was almost dessert-like for me)
Everything else:
- Lamb Biryani - good (not worth the price tag)
- Duck Vindaloo - I've had better duck elsewhere, but this was good
- Chiken Makhani - tasty, would order again
- Basket of Bread (three different types of Na'an) - disappointing (was expecting bursts of different flavors - or at least something noticeable, but this was all-around rather bland)
- Spinach Saag (I wanted some kind of vegetable - because everything else is very heavy - this was rather unmemorable though)
Rounding up from 3.5. Would likely never return, but enjoyed my meal while it lasted.",1
2,"We were so so excited to visit this restaurant. It came highly recommended by our hotel. We had visited it's sister place Chutney Mary's and were very pleased although we just had small bites in the bar. Veersawamy is beautiful. The view over Regent Street incredible. The scents were amazing and we were ready for a fantastic meal and experience. We were disappointed with both. Our server was cold and not attentive. She was on the sarcastic side and treated us like the tourists we were. Tourists who love London! She was neither British nor Indian and seemed to be miserable. That is unfortunate for her customers who spend high $$$ at Veeraswamy for food we could get in Central Square in Cambridge, MA or at a food truck in Portland, OR. Overpriced. Limited menu. Big disappointment.",-1
4,"The second pillar in the Holy Trinity of Indian food in London (see my Amaya review).
Veeraswamy would be my go-to choice of the three higher end Masala Zone restaurants (Amaya and Chutney Mary being the other two to choose from).  It is slightly less expensive than Amaya, making it a bit more attainable for an evening out.
The general decor and ambiance of Veeraswamy is gorgeous.  Outstanding wait staff service.  Fantastic food.  
It is really difficult to find a quality restaurant like this in its location near Picadilly Circus.  Veeraswamy is a great option for a classy dinner before heading out to the theater or just going out in that area.
I've had multiple fish dishes, octopus, shrimp curry, multiple biriyanis, and more and they've all been phenomenal.  They have a great wine menu as well, which pairs excellently with any of their entrees.  Their custom cocktails are also quite delicious (there was some sort of spicy martini I tried last time that was wonderful).
The waiters are always incredibly helpful in determining the appropriate meal size and selection.  They are also very knowledgable about their wine and cocktail list to suggest pairings.  They managed to make each of my three dining experiences there equally unique and enjoyable.
I could not recommend Veeraswamy any more strongly!  Great for a date night out, group or business dinner, or any nice occassion, really.
**same note as my Amaya review - check out the Masala Zone website for discounts, promotions or specials before you go!",1
5,"Oh My ! I actually found an Indian restaurant with good food outside India..
My hubby and I recently toured London from our hometown of New York.  I cook Indian food regularly and not easily impressed with restaurant Indian . This restaurant was on our short list and we chanced upon it whilst strolling Regent Street. 
1. Very little Indian food aroma that lingers in your hair long after the foods gone.
2. Fresh ingredients , no BS recipes or silly names for everyday dishes, good selection representing various Indian cuisines
3. Interesting artwork and pictures on wall, informal atmosphere
4. Helpful ,polite well trained staff.
5. Its not cheap, but so worth it.
Thanks Veeraswamy for a memorable London evening..:):)",1
4,Always amazing. The green prawns are not to be missed. Duck vindaloo was delicious and I don't even like duck unless it's confit!,1
5,"Outstanding service.  Amazing food.  The Biryani was exceptional.  The Duck Vindaloo was mind-blowing.  While I'll still hold a special place in my heart for The Bombay Brasserie this is my new favorite high-end Indian restaurant in London.  (Plus, I prefer the location.)",1
5,"Great food, awesome environment and the service was just plain excellent. We really enjoyed the wine selection!",1
4,"High quality Indian food in the city! I ordered the tasting menu that offered four different curry dishes to try with naan and rice to go with the dishes.The two appetizers in the beginning - lentil soup and a shrimp dish- was light and flavourful. The dessert consisted of ice cream and a creme brûlée with a hint of spice. Decor was unique and felt very comfortable. Bit quiet, so good for more intimate occasions.",1
5,"The food was Fabulous!
My Wife and I love to eat Indian food and the hotel we were staying recommended the Veeraswamy. We arrived at the restaurant and were promptly seated. We placed our order and I have to admit the food was some of the best we have had. This is an easy recommendation to make. Make sure to make a reservations, the place gets busy.",1
2,"Well it's all very promising when you walk in. Dark opulent looking room with lots of nice decoration. Lots of space and very comfortable. But I'd say the food lets it down somewhat. It's not the most expensive but it's pricey enough to expect something a little bit better than what I got.
I was in a big group and it was a Tue evening. We ordered a lot of finger food starters, chicken wings and the like. All overdone and no care taken over them at all. The accompanying sauces weren't in the slightest bit vibrant or surprising. When I eat Indian I want something vibrant and surprising.
My duck masala main course was again perfectly edible but carelessly done. Very overdone and with a ubiquitous masala sauce. I tried two of my guests' food. The lobster curry was a little more delicate without being amazing in any way.
I would expect this sort of food in a decent high street curry house. But the prices are far greater than that so you're paying for the area and the room inside which is a shame when there's so much great indian food around at the moment. I'm lucky enough to live near Indian Zing in Hammersmith and the food there knocks the food here into a cocked hat at a much much fairer price.",-1
4,"Solid Indian restaurant in London but probably not worth the ""1st Indian Restaurant in London"" premium you have to fork over. After all, first isn't necessarily the best.
 I went to Veeraswamy for a business dinner not knowing the history of it. The waitstaff was extremely attentive and the decor was what you would have expected of a high-end Indian place.
For appetizers, we split the Raj Puri (which was spot on delicious - perfectly crispy on the outside with the right amounts of creme and sauces inside - I could eat 3 of these just for my main course)  and the Sagg Panner (2 triangle chunks of paneer with a thin layer of sagg (spinach) inside. Quite uninspiring and I wouldn't get it again.
For my main course, I had the vegetarian sampler - which included dal (lentils), kofta (ball of ground chickpeas), two other dishes that I don't remember and I didn't really care for. The dal and the kofta were delicious! I didn't care for the other two. We also had a side of sagg, which normal sagg with tons of garlic but nothing unique.  Rice and naan were ordered separately on the side, which is annoying.
My dessert was a banana kulfi (think banana ice cream). It was the way Kulfi was supposed to be - mildly sweet and fragrant with all the Indian spices. If only they could have had Saffron Kulfi, I would have been in paradise. We also tried a Black Jaman. That was presented rather peculiarly but definitely satisfies any sweet tooth you may have.
I had Cobra beer (just one), and the wait-staff continually tried to push more on me. Quite annoying.  The beer selection was limited, with only Cobra and no Kingfisher..
Overall, Veeraswamy was nice to try out and enjoyable since I wasn't paying, but if I did pay, I'd pick something more affordable for the same quality of food. Total bill, including gratuity, was about £200 for a group of 3.",1
4,"Veeraswamy has an updated old charm with great environment and good food. There are only a few points that have detracted it from being a five star recommendation. 
Our table decided to go for the taster menu. All in all, I think when you're in a large group of people it's a great idea. We had two rounds of starters that where ok but not impressive followed by a strong entourage of curries of both pork and lamb and a very light dessert. The curries where very much traditional and tasty. Highly recommended. 
A large part of the reason why they don't have the fifth star was the bad service. We waited quite a bit of time between starters and drinks and desserts took a while to arrive as well. Additionally there was quite a bit of perceived hostility between our waiters which detracted from the experience. That coupled with the weak starters and the cotton candy flavored lychee ice tea make this a good restaurant to go to, just slightly overpriced for it's quality.",1
5,"Easily the best Indian meal I have ever had. I had the lamb biryani and I could have eaten that same dish every single night while we were in London. My husband was jealous even though his meal was good too. My biryani was so amazing, I don't even remember what he had.",1
2,"Not for Indian people.
This restaurant is catered to the ambiance and foreigners wanting chic Indian. There were only 2 items for vegetarians??? That makes no sense.  However the paneer makani was awesome so if the chef decided to put the 1 thing he did know how to cook this would be it!  Also this one is super pricey. Expect to pay $80 USD of 45 gbp a person for just 1 item ....and the naan, rice etc. is all extra charges.",-1
3,"I have been to Veeraswamy about 5 times. Clearly I enjoy the food. I am only giving it 3 stars because of its prices (I would like to give a 3.5 star rating if that was possible). 
The ambiance is wonderful and the food is quite good. 
But the food isn't in the creative/fusion category, and the restaurant prides itself as traditional. As a traditional fare, it just isn't that interesting or traditional. It tries to be chic and refined, but yet the food just isn't that special or exceptional to warrant the price.  You are paying for the ambiance.  The appetisers are more refined though, which I would recommend. I almost would argue having a full meal based on the appetisers as they have more subtleties and complexities that I would pay for. 
For the traditional curry and grill items, you can do better at many other places for half the prices and bigger portion. Punjab (Covent Garden) and Tiger Spices (Soho) are both cheaper and have more flavorful food with big curry kicks. 
For a glass of wine, a starter, two curries (portions are small and don't have much sauces) and a dessert, you are looking at about 45-50 quids.",-1
4,"This was my first time on the recommendation of a friend and it did not disappoint. The staff was exceptional as well as the ambience. The food was very good, although the portions weren't generous, especially for an ala carte scenario.  Rose petals on the table and great views of  Regent street. Room for parties as well as intimacy. I'd most definitely revisit.",1
5,".....what a treat for this Yank dining with my mate from London!  May be the best South Asian food I have ever savored......great service, ambiance and bright flavors!",1
4,"This is as upmarket as a curry house can be. Don't come here expecting £8 mains because you and your pocket will be sorely disappointed! Come here if you fancy an extravagant but glorious Indian experience. 
Veeraswamy is the oldest Indian retaurant in town and has quite auspicious beginnings - it was opened by an Indian Princess and English General and its new world flavours were an instant hit with the upper classes. 
The fact that it is still here is testament to the quality of the food. All regions of India are covered here, including some that are rarely prepared outside of the country itself. The Nizami Murgh that was recommended to me (chicken breast and koftas with pine nut, lemon and rose petal) was heavenly and there are coastal dishes such as Mussels Moilee which are firm favourites. 
If you want to eat in an opulent setting (gilded ceilings and chandeliers), and to experience real Indian cuisine it may cost you around £50 all in all but is an experience you won't soon forget.",1
4,"I know this place for 20 years already, first time being for dinner on New Year's Eve and this is a ""must go"" for our family whenever we are in London. Food and ambience are still great, mazing location. This time I had the green curry prawns and my husband the lamb. both delicious.  But we were a bit disappointed with the starters selection (the lamb kebab was good but it looked like an hamburger, what we didn't like). And the wine was a bit warm.  And that are the reasons for one less start this time.",1
4,"This is the best Indian restaurant that I've ever been to in my life.  Why not 5 stars, well we'll get to that.
Really great decor.  It feels traditional, yet modern at the same time.  The designer that did the lighting was very creative as the mood set by the lights was great.
The waitress that takes care of drinks was very attentive!  She recommended good drinks and even steered us away from the ones she didn't like.  She had a quick smile and made you feel welcome.
The waiter, the one who took our food order, wasn't so great.  No hello, or anything, just a, you ready to order?  He seemed to be in a hurry, but you know what?  With these prices, calm the f down.  At least a ""hello, welcome"" type of thing.
Look, the food was ridiculous.  I wish I remember what we had as an appetizer, but it ranks up there as one of the best things either of us have ever had.  The flavor explodes in your mouth.  It's like your tongue discovered all of its taste buds at the same time.  Spicy, but never too spicy.  It was some kind of a chicken kebab that we ordered as an appetizer, but I'll get it as the main dish next time.  The waiter, his only saving grace, quickly and nervously recommended this.  I personally think that he just did this because it was first on the list.  I kind of wanted to punch him.
Try the mixed drinks.  They were excellent.  Made in a way that you can't taste the alcohol, but if you drink enough, you'll know that it's in there.
Dessert was nothing to write about.  I'll pass next time.
The waiter never came around to see how we were doing or anything like that.  Just when it was time to pay.  
When we were walking out we discovered that our Indian hostess was actually Brazilian.  First of all, Brazilians are everywhere in London and now they even work in Indian restaurants passing themselves off as Indian!!!  I love it.
There is a Russian guy dressed like an Indian guard of some kind outside.  He said that they have their own cabs.  I got into the cab and the driver started to put our address in his GPS.  Um, no.  When I got out, they tried to talk me into taking one of their cars until I discovered they charge 20 pounds flat fee.  This is a robbery and I personally think that this is something that the Russian guy has going on the side.  
We will 100% be back.  Great decor, amazing food and drinks, but shitty waiter.  I'll still be back.",1
4,A really classy restaurant in a great location. Great views to the street from the 2nd floor dining area and a somewhat hidden entrance. They've been doing it right for 80+ years. Great food and a surprising value.,1
4,"I just visited London and went here to have Indian food.  It was so good!  The chicken masala, paneer, and garlic naan were my favorite. The duck vindaloo was good too. I will definitely come back here when I'm in London.",1
1,"We originally tried to make a reservation for a weekday. However, it was booked. Wow, an indian restaurant fully booked for a weekday. We had high expectations.
Actual dining experience was horrific. Food was bland. Informed restaurant management. Manager argued with us (the customers) saying the food was top notch and flavorful. Where does a  business get off arguing with the customer? Horrible. Will never go back and would recommend not to waste your money on this. There are too many other good indian restaurants in London to pay for this overpriced pompous food.
Also, may want to make sure your dishes are clean. What a waste of money.",-1
5,"My girlfriend and I went there on Christmas Eve because everything else was closed for the holiday. We were the only ones  in the place, which worried me at first. But I have to say that this place is AMAZING. The food was cheap enough considering all that we got.  I had the lamp binary? Is that how its spelled? It was amazing. There were lots of vegetarian options for my friend.
The server was a bit awkward about everything. It was fine though. He didnt speak great english, but he was nice. If I was a resident in London, I would certainly go back this week. But since I was just visiting from San Diego, it probably be a while before i go back :/",1
5,"Our hotel recommended this restaurant and we were quite excited to learn it is the oldest Indian restaurant in London. 
We had an early lunch here on a Sunday morning in June including myself, my husband and our 8 year old daughter. It is not really a place for kids but they did make some recommendations that were not too spicy for her as well as a yummy drink recommendation too. That drink was a rose water lemonade drink that she and I both LOVED!
The decor is absolutely beautiful with colorful lamps and comfortable seating. 
We had a chicken wing appetizer which was one of the most flavorful dishes I've ever had. We also had a tandoori chicken which was so tender and smoky. My husband ate a fantastic chicken vindaloo which he loved, although I believe he would have liked it spicier. I thought it was perfect.
The service was good but they mixed up our teas - they said the jasmine tea was the black tea and the black tea was the jasmine tea. We thought that was extremely odd for them not to know the teas and that we had to tell them the difference. But not a big deal.
Overall, we loved it.",1
3,Service was very good but the food wasn't very authentic. It's definitely westernized Indian food.,-1
5,"One of the best restaurants in London. It offers classical Indian courses, prepared with care and a nice spicy touch from the chef. I truly admire the food and the way it is served. If we have visitors who are not from London, this is one of our first stops of the tour.",1
5,"Best Indian food I've had in my life, including awards for best saag and a killer banana kulfi for dessert. The roti was a disappointment, though, and there was one small hitch with service.
Verraswamy has been at the same location for 83 years, and claims to be the first and oldest Indian restaurant in London. The restaurant is beautiful and stylish too. 
Expensive (£70/person for dinner, not including drinks), but generally good service and presentation combined with excellently prepared dishes.",1
5,"Veeraswamy is the finest Indian restaurant that I have ever had the privilege of dining at.  Beautifully decorated, with giant windows to look out at London through.  This is THE place to have a romantic dinner or an important business meeting.  The staff are attentive, but not bothersome.  The food is absolutely amazing, everything is worth mentioning.  My personal favorite is the Sholay Chicken Tikka.  Although you would be tempted to stick to your old favorites, this is the place to be adventurous, because everything is fantastic and you might discover something new that you love.
Each time that I visit London, this is somewhere that I will feature as one of the highlights of London.
Be sure and book early, as they tend to get filled up weeks in advance for prime dinner times.",1
1,"OK food, expensive, absolutely terrible service.  There are so many good Indian restaurants within walking distance of this standby.  Choose the others.",-1
5,"This is not your run of the mill Brick Lane curry house.  Consider this the jewel in the crown of Indian restaurants in London!
I made it a point to seek out Veeraswamy on my most recent vacation to London.  According to their website, they are the oldest surviving Indian restaurant in the UK.  All those years of being in business has added up to pure perfection!
The first thing that grabbed my attention when I arrived is the amazing decor...purple accents everywhere, beautiful jewel tone lanterns hanging all about, soothing dim lighting, the wall of candles in the back of the room.  I immediately felt at home here.  We were seated right by a window, which not only afforded us a great view of Regent street below, but a great view of the beautiful dining room we were in.
The service is impeccable!  The staff is extremely welcoming, polished and professional.  The timing of the service for each course of our meal was perfect.  
The food is absolutely the best Indian food I've ever had anywhere (my husband and I both love Indian food and eat it at least once a week, so we've been to many Indian restaurants around the world).  I would compare the quality of the food to what you would get at Tabla in NYC, just that here at Veeraswamy, you are getting more traditional Indian fare, compared to the Indian fusion you get at Tabla.  Every course was delicious, spicy and flavorful.  The portions are just right as well - nothing huge and overwhelming.  
Veeraswamy offers a great selection of wines (as well as beers and cocktails) to pair with your meal.  
This place is by no means reasonable - but I can assure you, it's worth the splurge.  I'm already dreaming of my next meal here, just as soon as I can get back to London!",1
3,"Welcome to the most expensive curry house on the whole planet. I first tried it in the seventies when the restaurant was owned by an Englishman by the name of Edwin Palmer. He grew up in Hyderabad in India. He also marketed a selection of jarred curry products under the name of E.P. Veeraswamy. 
What took me aback, like a dumb slapstick comedy, was being greeted at the elevator by a man dressed as a Hunzar, including a foot high cloth fin coming out of his hat, who saluted my date and I like we were four star generals. To this very day, it gives me a good laugh. The food was boringly mild and tasteless. The price was through the stratosphere.
New owners ditched the fake Hunzar in the elevator and greatly improved the quality of their menu. The food is excellent but incredibly London England style. As long as you are not looking for authentic and you want to stay close to the theatre district, Piccadilly Circus, or the West End you cannot go wrong on quality. Just bring a wheel barrow load full of money. 
I give it four stars for the food but two stars for the price, making a three. It is only a short ride on the tube to Queensway where you will find more authentic food with prices where you will only need a fistful of money and can leave the wheel barrow in your hotel safe. A better than five star Indo-Pakistani restaurant is Shezan in Knightsbridge for those with six figure incomes. The food is authentic Punjabi and Northwest Frontier.
A multi course lunch at Veeraswamy for two will cost about 80 to 100 pounds and dinner about 120 to 150 pounds; more if you include a bottle of Champagne which I believe is the perfect wine match for Indian style food. Red wines clash, an Australian Shiraz the least, and the food overpowers most white wines except for a Gewurztraminer which can cost more that a magnum of bubbly. A glass of cold lager is even better and so much easier on the pocketbook.
If you want authentic Amritsar Punjabi style, take the train to Southall from Paddington Station. It is a 30 minute ride and you will enjoy fabulous Masalas, Seekh Kebabs, naan, tikkas etc. for a fraction of the price and oh so much better. Dress casual for Southall and fancy for Veeraswamy.",-1
4,"Amazing decor, service was decent, food was excellent.  Well worth the tube ride from any part of London if you love Indian food.  While there is no shortage of Indian restaurants in London put this on your list as a must try.  The duck vindaloo was a first for me and it was fantastic.",1
2,"A really posh restaurant steeped in history. That does not though, satisfy the taste buds of a vegetarian. The appetizers were good, but not exceptional. The main course was largely passable. You expect much more from such a posh place. My recommendation is to skip this if you are a fellow vegetarian. London has much better to offer.",-1
3,Great service and very good value for money try the Vindaloo will be back for more Yummy,-1
4,"90% of restaurants fail within the first two years of inception and 95% of all statistics are made up on the spot.  I don't really know what the percentage is, but everyone knows most restrauants fail before they gain any traction with diners.  So in the restaurant business, I'm a firm believer in longevity.  
According to its website, ""Veeraswamy is the oldest surviving Indian restaurant in the U.K. and possibly the world.""  
It might also be one of the most expensive Indian restaurants in the world.  
I went to Veerawamy one Friday night for dinner.  It is right around the corner from my office and I've wanted to try it for quite some time.  
I wasn't dissapointed.  Everything I ate was spot-on.  Traditional dishes were as good if not better than anything else I've tried and the more contemporary dishes were also fantastic.  
All in all, it is not cheap, but good food in London seldom is.  I'd definitely go back and think it was worth every penny.",1
4,"Amazing food... great service.... 
the shrimp and lamb was excellent !",1
4,"So my wife and I wanted some ""down and dirty"" Indian food while in London. We were given directions to this place by the concierge. When we arrived, we realized that this was not what we were planning as the menu was a bit pricey. But it was immediately obvious why this place has been around for 88 years!!!! The food was beautifully presented and flavorful without being overpowering. We did the tasting menu. It was a great way to get to sample the most popular dishes. If you want an upscale Indian dining experience, this is the place! At a 130 pounds without cocktails, just be prepared to pay extra for the fancy (yet delicious) version of Chicken Tikka and Lamb Rogan Gosh",1
3,"The decor was very nice but the food was ok for how much they charge.  I have a nut allergy so our waiter was only able to suggest three items for me to eat. I had the tomatoe soup- lovely, the prawns- very bland and the Bharta. The Bharta was good as well but not authentic. Being Indian, I thought the food was very mild. The other three in the party had the tasting menu- which was decent.  All in all,  I know there are far superior places to eat Indian food in London so definitely not worth the 300gbps!",-1
4,"great ambiance, good service, and good food.  The appetizers were very small.....but the Paneer and Biryani entrees were much better sized....great drinks.",1
5,"My boyfriend is an indian food fanatic. If he could, I think he would eat Indian food 3 times a day, seven days a week, and still never get bored.
 Over the past three years of our relationship, we have been everywhere from traditional restaurants in Cambridge, York and Brick Lane, ""modern"" indians like Bombay Bicycle Club, Masala Zone and Imli, and ""upmarket"" joints like Amaya.
 So, when I decided that an Indian tasting menu would be the perfect birthday present for him, I knew I needed somewhere special.
 And that place was Veeraswamy.
 As previous reviewers have mentioned, Veeraswamy is the oldest running Indian restaurant in London, which gives the place a sense of history. This is evident from the turbans hanging on the walls: gifts from visiting Maharajahs.
 I booked the table weeks in advance and had 1 very annoying request: I wanted the tasting menu for both of us, but I don't eat red meat - would it be possible to do one veggie?
 Now, any foodie worth their salt will know that the rule is always the same: the tasting menu has to be ordered by the whole table.
 Not so at Veeraswamy. The restaurant was delightfully accomodating, not only over the phone, but in person too.
 I can honestly say that the restaurant has the nicest, most welcoming staff I have ever come across. The gentleman who led us to the table reassured me that the chef is well aware of my request, but then reappeared a few minutes later to say, ""The chef is worried that you're only having vegetables in your meal - he would like to know if you'd like some prawns with your main course?"" Could they get any nicer?
 I am still salivating over my starter: Raj kachori (a large crisp puri filled with lentils, tamarind chutney and yoghurt). This was beautifully presented with little pomegranate jewels, and the taste was extraordinary. And boy, am I glad I ordered the prawns: the giant green prawn was a dry dish with an intense flavour which followed perfectly on from my light starter. Alongside a keralan chicken curry (which I also tried) and a lamb curry (which I didn't), my boyfriend was in heaven.
 The mango sorbet was the perfect end to the meal, but this was topped (if possible) when they brought out another tart, dark chocolate sorbet with a candle in it - completely out of the restaurant's own impetus - which made my night.
 Yes, it's not exactly street food prices, but then it's not exactly your average Indian. It's special, and you pay for what you get - wonderful staff, delicious food and a colourful, romantic atmosphere right in the heart of London.",1
3,"Visited on a short trip to London (from California). Menu is not that Vegi/Vegan friendly. Service was good and they accommodated my request for customization. Taste of food was ok, not too great... apart from history, I feel it was not worth the money... 
If I am in Piccadilly again, I would go to other places...",-1
4,"At the time I ate here, I hadn't been to India yet and understandably, the food I had in Delhi was better than the food I had here. However, up until I ate here, I had never really liked Indian food. I hadn't written it off and for that reason, I was down for eating here when it was suggested.
I heard the stories of how this is the oldest Indian restaurant in the UK and how tons of famous folks eat here. That doesn't necessary make it good by default, but with the many choices of decent Indian food in London, I think it does mean something that the restaurant has been in business for so long. Places go out of business regularly, especially in these times.
Now onto the food. We had quite a spread because a) I didn't know what I wanted and b) I was eating with two people (my father (travels to India at least 10 times a year) and an Indian) who couldn't settle on one thing to get. I have to say that I loved the tandoori chicken--it melted in my mouth and is to die for. Everything we had was good, down to the Indian ice cream. The service was good too. They were patient as we figured out what we wanted and were always nearby if we needed anything. Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the decor; it's gorgeous. Glass chandeliers, modern furniture, peaceful ambiance. You'd never guess that the restaurant was so old based solely on the decoration. 
I go to London fairly regularly and though this place is pricey, I will definitely go back!",1
5,"Best Indian food we've ever had.  I dream about visiting London again and trying the food here.  I didn't see butter chicken or masala on the menu and was worried but the waiter helped choose our dishes.  I'm not a huge fan of fish but the fish wrapped in banana leaves was divine.  There was a sweet pomegranate dip in a crispy bread bowl that was to die for.  Nothing at home can compare to this place and I live in an area that is highly populated with Indians.  Indian restaurants are around every corner.  The only place that is almost at the same level is Rasika in DC, which doesn't fill in the empty longing for London cuisine.",1
4,it's the oldest British Indian restaurant located close to Piccadilly Circus. Good choice of food and drinks  please try saag and spicy duck. Very friendly staff. Not cheap but still affordable given the location of the restaurant,1
3,"The red snapper appetizer was awesome, but the rest of the main course was so-so.  Definitely not the best Indian I have had. Pricey.  Service is ok...the indian server from Mauritius serving me was attentive though very busy. Nothing to write home about.  Everyone crows about how great Indian food is in London....not thus far.  :-(",-1
4,"This place is excellent. You get what you pay for. Very creative cuisine, great service, great wine list. I've eaten here several times over the last 10 years and never been disappointed. I would have given a 5 star this time but our waiter was new and struggling a bit. But she still did a great job and it must have been tough for her. Still my second favorite Indian. First is the Bukhara in New Delhi, India - unbeatable ! But if you can't go there - go here !",1
3,"Classic Indian fare using fresh tasty ingredients for a premium. Perhaps the cost is to cover the rose petal covered tables and brightly coloured hats on the walls. The vibrant decor and friendly service make for a delightful dining experience.  That said, nothing about our meal really stood out and I most likely won't be returning here.",-1
4,"Veeraswamy serves a slightly sweeter, milder type of Indian cuisine.  I've heard is described as ""proper English curry"" before.  The quality of the food was amazing and so was the service.  A little pricey but a great way to introduce people to Indian food.",1
2,"It seems to me that the staff at Veeraswamy believe that they can rest easy on the reputation of being the ""oldest Indian restaurant"" in London, as well a star in the constellation of London's most popular (and expensive) Indian restaurants. However, our waitress was lackadaisical, slow, snobbish, and flippantly rude. And when I say ""slow"", I mean excruciatingly slow with suggestions like ""I'm sure you want to wait until the next course."" Well, actually, no. I don't want to wait 15-25 minutes between each course.  It cast a pall over the lovely dishes - which were, indeed, fine - but certainly not awe-inspiring by any stretch of the imagination. The lamb knuckles were delicious and tender. The chicken in the chicken curry, however, was tough. Great naan. Mediocre rice. The best thing was their interpretation of ""street food"" chaat - which was fantastic. We had the tasting menu - 75 pounds with wine per person. After cocktails and the chaat (which we ordered separately) it's a pretty hefty price to pay (about 200 pounds - $320 or so) for the ""thanks"" that she tossed off with a shrug of her shoulders. She seemed offended that we didn't want coffee or tea. How barbaric of us. I don't recommend this restaurant - you're much better off at a smaller, family-run place - where the quality of food will be very similar and with a staff who is glad to serve you.",-1
4,"Ever wonder about how Indian cuisine matches up with cocktails and wines? Well ponder no further, here is your savory savior. They have a small but diverse French wine selection and a mixture of bubbles and liquors that that will challenge that tingling tongue.  
Just bring your plastic. Cause it's guaranteed to hit a new $$$$.",1
4,"Figuring that we could find more than decent Indian food in London, S & I decided upon Veeraswamy.
The food was amazing! It was great, if not better than some of the places I've been to in SiliValley.
However, I would have appreciated the memo telling me that Indian food in London is like a jillion times spicier than it is here in the states!",1
4,"Good choice of curry
 Staff = good
Food = good
Price = High
Value = average
Location = close to Oxford St shops
 Overall _good atmosphere and we will go again.
 July 2010
 Went again and was delighted
 Atmospheric, friendly, easy access
colourful ...somewhat special",1
2,"Food was just average. Bland spices. They don't have ""typical"" indian restaurant food, but the food I tried was bland. Service was mediocre at best, took forever to get check.",-1
1,"Just to clarify this review does not reflect the quality of the food but the service of the establishment. Although we had a reservation at 5:30 on Saturday 4th Jan we decided to not dine there solely based on the level of service provided. We reached Veeraswamy at 5:20 and were told by the maître d' to wait outside on the street till the restaurant opened. When asked whether we could wait at the long seating area where a couple was already waiting, we were told that the area would get crowded although the sofa at the waiting area could seat at least 5 more. We went down and immediately after another couple walked up. We waited to see whether they would be told the same. But to our surprise they were not asked to wait on the streets as they never walked back out. When we went back to ask about that the maître d' acted as if he was not sure what we were talking about. We decided at that point not to dine there and went somewhere else. To me this is a first and quite discriminating and in most parts of the world would be considered racist as we were the only people of Indian origin who were waiting at that point of time. I was also surprised that an establishment of such stature have such disappointing service. To be fair we were contacted after half an hour but by that point it honestly felt because they had an empty table left. The food may be fantastic but if the service is this bad I honestly can't recommend it to anyone.",-1
5,"Definitely memorable and delicious south Indian food and awesome decor - I love their pineapple pachadi so much here - i even make it for myself now! I am a veg and i don't eat onion and garlic etc. so they make something off the menu for me -- my std order is pineapple pachadi, a bean or bhindi dish, some dhal and some whole wheat roti and raita - that's literally all I have ever had at this restaurant - that and this delicious fresh juice thats a blend of OJ and blood oranges (Yummmmm!!) -- so I can't speak to too many things on the actual menu - but what I get is so awesome that I keep going back for more! And the food is so unique - I'm from South India - and still the tastes here are so unique and subtle!! And again - the whole restaurant is beautiful and peaceful - its like a bit of a retreat in the middle of oxford street!",1
4,"""Indian"" food is my vice and I have bad it for a long time. Purely because V iis the oldest restaurant meant I had to add it to my list along with the spurious Top 10s etc.
 I knew it was expensive so had waited for my 50th birthday to justify dragging the family 120 miles south for a curry.
 Every restaurant will have mixed reviews, why? The decor is impressive but I have seen better. Whether the the food is poor, good or excellent is your opinion, I think this is often down to people not really knowing what they've actually ordered. Indian, Pakistani and the more common Bangladeshi restaurants have their own characteristics. 
My tip for a good meal is take your time, talk to the waiter and question the menu and (if in doubt) make sure you know exactly what your getting, it's your money. One man's bhuna is another man's mulligatawny.
 My experience was overall very good but it I thought it wasn't worth the money although my wife & kids did. I particularly disliked the fact that none of the staff had Asian heritage but appreciate it could be different on another night.",1
4,Great Indian food - highlight was the Kerala Prawn Curry.  Addictive sauce that means you'll want to lick the plate!,1
5,"Established in 1926 (on the same day as Queen Liz's birth), Veeraswamy is Britain's oldest Indian restaurant, one of London's oldest surviving restaurants and possibly one of its most lauded. Indeed, National Geographic reckons Veeraswamy is among the ten best destination and special restaurants in the world. If you've got the cash, love Indian cuisine and fancy a superb view over Regent Street, I highly recommend a visit.
 Menu highlights include a starter course of irresistibly crisp green leaf and okra bhajias (whole okra and leaves of fenugreek, ruby chard and mint coated in a light rice flour batter, £9) with a particularly creamy coriander and mint sauce and a tangy tamarind chutney with pomegranate seeds. For the main course, consider the Sholay chicken tikka smoked with garam masala (£9 as a starter, £18 as a main). Charred right bits of especially tender chicken with a bit of kick, I'd definitely choose that dish again. Another item I'd certainly be keen to enjoy again is the side dish of fresh pineapple curry (pineapple, curry, mustard and green chilli, £9). Unusually savoury, I'd go back for it alone. Veeraswamy's flaky on the outside/fluffy on the inside layered naan (£3.35) are delectable, while kaala jaam (large black gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream, £6.75) for puds ends any Indian feast on a moreish note.
 Right off Regent Street (the restaurants' first floor dining room hovers above it), with an ethnic without being kitsch atmosphere, incredibly attentive service, fascinating history and an exceptionally tasty menu: Veerswamy is an elegant restaurant serving delectable Indian cuisine.",1
4,"Veerswamy is purported to be the oldest Indian restaurant in Europe but it certainly doesn't feel like it. The modern brightly lit decor is spacious and welcoming. The dishes are varied and very very tasty including the traditional curries with recipes from across India. The service is impeccable with attentive and helpful wait staff who are prompt but never rushed. The only big detraction is the price...even for Indian food or London upscale dining this is an expensive restaurant which puts this to ""On Special Occasions Only"" category. BTW, for the geeks in the house the Apple Store is down the street.",1
4,"Wonderful Indian food with amazing ambiance and lighting.
I patronized this place in an attempt to find a quality Indian restaurant in London.  I was here in London for the first time and put this on my list of things to do.  
The food is delicious, the service is impeccable, and most of all, the ambiance and decor is absolutely awesome.   
As others have said, come here ready to spend some dough but rest assured you won't be disappointed.",1
5,"Not your average Indian! Stands a head above the rest, menu was very different to usual Indian restaurants. Cooking style was very light compared to many heavily oiled dishes at other places. Staff were very polite and the service was great. Highly recommended.",1
4,"Whenever I'm in London, I look forward to a meal here.  The food is great as is the service, ambiance is nice and one of the worlds great beers is available here - Cobra.  This is not your average, run-of-the-mill Indian restaurant - this is upscale dining and well worth the price.",1
3,"I booked a table at Veeraswamy as it brought back childhood memories and  was disappointed that the authentically dressed 'bouncer' wearing turban and massive sabre, who terrified me as a child wasn't standing vigil on our arrival.
The restaurant is extremely snazzy and has a great ambience. The service was attentive without being intrusive. The food was very good, although portions were small considering the prices, but that's Regent Street for you I suppose. 
We enjoyed our meal, but were starving first the next morning. I am disappointed to say that it didn't quite meet my expectations having dined there regulary 'some' years ago.",-1
4,"My father had been here about 30 years ago and wanted to go back when he visited me in London this year.  Great food, great service and killer martinis.  Also it's a very pretty restaurant.  Given the price I would save this for special occassion dinners.",1
5,"Veerswamy is definitely an older, if not the oldest Indian restaurant in London.  They have pictures of all types of Indian dignitaries making spots here.  Trying to find this place is a bit confusing, since the entry is small and in an alley and the actual restaurant is upstairs.  They food was great! Definitely modernization has updated their dinning room and created a chic ambiance.  All together this was a great stop on our European vacation.",1
4,"I see that Angela covered the history lesson, so I'll get right to the food.  The dishes and curries here are great, served in a dazzling array of bowls and pots.  The Indian food here is a bit more spicy and a bit less sweet than the Indian food I'm used to having in Los Angeles, but definitely full of great flavor and aroma.  Excellent service as well!",1
4,"The longest established curry house in the UK (or so they say), this is not your run-of-the-mill establishment. Updated with colourful, ethnic design the restaurant serves modern Indian settings in a contemporary setting reminiscint of a Maharaja's Palace. Pricey, but worth the money, a great venue for a fun night out.",1
3,"Doubtless, I was more impressed when I was there the first time, 1967!
Now I don't like the - much praised - ambience and atmosphere of this place very much. It has coulorful lights like a cocktail bar.
A third of the food impressingly good, a third of standard quality and the last third boring in taste.
The prices are really high and are not justified.
 The service is polite and tries to be really good - not always successfully.",-1
5,"I'm a bit of a foodie (really its the only reason why I go to the gym) and I LOVE LOVE Veeraswamy.
The food is authentic and some of the best that I have eatern. The staff are attentive, without being overbearing.
The decor was getting slightly tacky, but they have had a refurb thats great (but not as great as Porte Des Indes).",1
5,"Holy %@#$.  I just about died eating here.  I hated Indian food before and had a great experience at a hole in the wall elsewhere in London, and then a few days later came here, and became a total die-hard.  I'm a vegequarian and I even eat the Chicken Tikka here it's that good.  It's the only restaurant that I dream about on a regular basis and can't wait to get to after a year away this summer!",1
4,Had a very good lunch here.  Food was really well prepared.  Good flavor.  Unique preparations that are not very common in Indian restaurants.  Service and room were very nice.  Slightly modern decor. Nice space overlooking Regent St.,1
5,"My husband and I ate dinner here before the Lion King show and had a fantastic time! 
This French restaurant is clean, classy, and romantic. We were immediately greeted at the door and sat at a table. 
Our server, Ridas, went above and beyond to make sure that our dinner was amazing! He was such a hard worker and the restaurant is lucky to have him. 
We started with the Burrata with tomatoes, olive oil and basil. Every ingredient in this appetizer was so fresh, kicking our meal off to a great start.
For dinner, I had the veal schnitzel holstein with green beans served with a fried egg on top. This schnitzel was delicious! The veal was tender and flavorful and fried to perfection--crispy and not greasy. The green beans and egg were done perfectly and added to the dish well. 
My husband is allergic to onions and garlic and was super bummed out when they told him that the side of macaroni and cheese had his allergens. We wanted to split the mac n' cheese. Our server and the chef went ABOVE AND BEYOND to make this mac n' cheese possible for us. Ridas advocated for us and the chef made a special batch of mac n' cheese just for us. We were blown away and the mac n' cheese was so good! It was perfectly cheesy, not oily and the pasta was cooked perfectly. 
Overall, superb service, outstanding food, fair prices, and great ambiance! We will definitely be back when we go to London again!",1
3,"The hosts are very rude, it made me leave before even thinking about asking for a table, but we decided to give it another try later on. Hosts are still rude, so we just decided to grab drinks and a dessert rather than spending money here on dinner if it was going to be just as disappointing as the staff. Luckily, the bar staff is a little nicer. We ordered a carafe of red wine and dessert, which was not worth remembering the name. It was like a panda cotta with a creme brûlée top (torched sugar) which was unevenly torched, the middle too burnt and the sides left with raw sugar. I did feel like the flavors were wonderful, but the presentation was unimpressive. Overall, my experience here was not worth coming back. If you're looking for nicely done french food, keep searching. I will say the ambiance is aimed for a more romantic feel, but the decor is very similar to that of the Cheesecake Factory (an American chain restaurant.) 
I apologize for the not so great photos, the lighting inside at night is not ideal for photos and I didn't care enough to waste my time editing them.",-1
4,"Ordered take away from their bakery for a quick bite to eat! We got a sausage roll, mushroom & hummus sandwich and roast beef sandwich, totalling to £14.40. If you dine in, the cost of each dish is increased by about £1.50.
The sausage texture was soft like a minced meat. The roll itself was extremely oily but it tasted great (probably because of all the oil). The roast beef sandwich was great toasted, although it had too much bread and not enough sandwich contents. The mushroom & hummus sandwich came with a SURPRISE EGGPLANT. I feel like there was more eggplant than mushroom, and instead should've been called ""eggplant sandwich with mushroom and hummus."" I'm not mad at it though because I love eggplant, but just a warning for those of you who are expecting mushrooms and hummus and end up with an eggplant too.",1
4,"My wife and I were just walking out of Covent Garden and spotted the restaurant. Went in and the atmosphere just felt right. The couple seated next next to us were finishing with some amazing looking desserts. So, we decided to split an entree (I.e., we are retired and ate lunch three hours earlier) and each have a dessert. The beef stroganoff was some of the best we have had anywhere. The desserts were great. Service was attentive and done as a team. This was the best meal we have had in London in over one week.  Will do our best to return again.
Back again after two years. Still good food. On Thursday evening, it did seem noisy but still at a level where conversations could be held.",1
5,"**Review is for the Boulangerie** 
Found myself daydreaming about food (surprise, surprise) - specifically Balthazar's hazelnut rocher. 
It's been a while, but I still think back to my halcyon summer of snagging a fresh lemon tart or fluffy croissant each morning. Balthazar (the restaurant proper) and their adjacent Boulangerie are stationed in bustling Covent Garden. The restaurant remains woefully out of my price range, so the bakery became my preferred haunt. Grab one of their canary-yellow boxes, load up on some heavenly carbs, and resist the urge to eat them until you arrive at your dining location. 
The shop has great versatility - everything from fresh loaves of French bread (served with giant butter pats) to whimsical, fist-sized meringues. The bread is good stuff. Full stop. Soft, warm, and perfectly crisped. Grab a loaf, head to a market for some cured meats or lox, and make some causal tartines in a local park. I've never regretted doing so. 
My favourite desserts were the chocolate hazelnut rocher and their lemon tart. Likely in my top 5 pastries ever consumed to date? The richness and texture of the rocher's mousse was remarkable. Think a Ferrero Rocher but ten times the size, softer, and far more rich. Needless to say, the first time I tried one I was back the next day for a repeat experience. As for the lemon tart it has a thick, eggy curd. Many tarts I've had in the US suffer from that artificial gelatine-based filling (you can't even really call it a curd), but Balthazar's tastes like true sugared lemon. Their oversized macarons - almost comparable in size to a hamburger - are adorable, but just a tad saccharine for my tastes. The flourless chocolate cake sphere was like pure cocoa magma and sensationally rich. It's heaven in there. 
Didn't know there's a sister location in NYC, so my mouth is watering at the prospect at having some Balthazar bread and sweeties within (conceivable) driving distance.",1
5,"Visited Balthazar at around 10:30 PM after watching ""the women in black"" at fortune theatre. Really nice Ambience. Huge french restaurant.  Helpful and decent staff. Quick service. 
Must visit restaurant. 
They have a good veg options too. 
Nearest underground station- Covent Garden.",1
4,"Stumbling along with no food plans we came upon an offering of a NYC favorite. Same menu, oddly lower prices, great service and packed as any of Keith McNally's places are.",1
3,"I'd been meaning to go to the NY location for ages and was excited when my friend suggested we grab dinner here. We got here around 7 PM on Friday and there was no wait at all, perfect. Our server was super nice and patient! We hadn't seen each other for years so he let us catch up a bunch and was nice about the fact that we hadn't even opened our menus the first two times he came around. 
I had the Rocket and Spinach Agnolotti as an entree. Loved the bitterness of the arugula and the simple flavors worked well together. The hazelnut also added a nice tough. It seemed unnecessary oily though and felt heavy in my tummy. My friend and I then split the Creme Brulee. Good thing we did because it was massive. I enjoyed the sugary crust but the rest of it was just okay. It could've been creamier and more flavorful.  
We left around 10 PM and there were way more people than when we got here. Guessing it attracts the post-theater crowd. Good vibe and nice service, but mediocre food.",-1
4,"The food was good, not great...but we finished our plates ;-)
The service by our main waiter was good, but was overwhelmed by training a new assistant/ busboy...who was in waaaay over his head. That made the wait for our dishes to be cleared as long it takes to walk Covent Garden and back... we feel sorry for anyone's first day on the job, but between hearing the manager berate the waiter, the waiter berate the busboy, and the busboy sinking hopelessly, we were all to exhausted to enjoy the meal. 
To bad, different circumstances, I'm sure it would've been much better for this quaint and well appointed French restaurant. Only a 1 Star minus. Give it a try!",1
3,"Nice French restaurant right outside Covent Garden.
The steak tartar I had was authentic and perfect.  But the pre fix menu was just ok.
Steak was about 4 oz and was cooked well done.  Not much flavor this the need for brown sauce. Cream brûlée was freaky but the crust was thin and clearly pre made.
Romantic place but brasserie quality you find in Paris.",-1
5,I love the NYC location so I had to try this one while I was in London recently. It did not disappoint. I had the chicken Paillard followed by profiteroles for dessert. Everything was excellent and the service was great too. As soon as I sat down the waiter asked if I wanted a glass of wine and he gave it to me on the house! The restaurant itself is in a nice area and the inside looks just like the New York location. It also wasn't overly expensive which I appreciated since I was on a business trip. Remains one of my favorites!!,1
3,"My husband and I came here in March 2017 for dinner one night during our time in London. We had reservations (which were relatively easy to secure) and arrived to our table. The restaurant is packed and busy on a weeknight. We ordered:
1) Ribeye steak - my husband ordered this and was underwhelmed. maybe his expectations were too high but he said it was only OK
2) duck confit - I really enjoyed this dish and felt the flavors were tasty and just right.
3) onion soup - my husband ordered this too and again, he thought it was just ""eh"".
Overall, the service was friendly although they were so busy that it didn't feel as welcoming. Even though this place has high marks, we left feeling like the experience was only mediocre.",-1
4,"Nice decor, friendly service.
The tables are too close together. I felt I could have easily joined the conversations next to us.
I had the chopped salad. It was very good. There were more toppings then actual lettuce which was weird but I enjoyed it. 
My fiancé had the full breakfast. Great portion size and good food.",1
4,"The short: you can expect a solid meal and great service at Balthazar. 
The longer: I came for a weekday breakfast business meeting, and was greeted by a kind hostess who coat checked my coat and umbrella. 
We had a round booth table, the restaurant was beautifully decorated with tons of staff. Our waiter immediately got us water, coffee and iced tea. 
I ordered poached eggs with smoked salmon. The homemade English muffin was delicious, the salmon was fresh, and the eggs were perfectly cooked. I was able to get the hollandaise sauce on the side. 
Overall, great meal, excellent service in a prime location.",1
5,"We visited this French Brasserie after seeing Mama Mia.  Very vibrant atmoshere and the food is stellar!  Cool vibe, amazing food, and open late. Perfect for after show or just late night bite to eat!",1
5,"These guys saved me from the ineptitude of the corner bakery, just down the block, who couldn't seem to handle 2 customers at once.  Being familiar with the patisserie and restaurant in NYC, I knew I could find quality and service here.
They came through with my Americano, and small almond loaf, that was just enough to take the edge off my jet-lagged feed cycle, before lunch.  Two pleasant young ladies waited on me, and chatted with locals.  It wasn't crowded in the 5 stool interior, and it was just a nice and relaxing respite.",1
4,"I passed by a week ago and find out they do a good deal of prix menu and promised will treat myself for that. Glad that i booked the restaurant to secure our table for lunch. When i walked in...the interior look so grant with high ceiling with hanging fans.The prix fixe menu is simple and has a good selections and inexpensive. We has three courses only cost £22.50. Lovely Starter including soup of the the day, squid ink risotto..and i love the main course..roasted pollock..thick cod with peas. Desserts of the day look creative..it has peach with creamy white chocolate shell. The meal taste good and we really enjoy it.",1
4,"Still good after a few years, but maybe showing its age a bit. We managed to walk in without a reservation, at around 8 pm on a Monday. We've eaten here before, as well as  dining at the original NYC location, and have always had a nice time and decent food. The scallops were a fine starter, and the onion soup was classic. Both Lamb and steak frites were tasty if perhaps unmemorable. Service is fine but can get a bit thin if the place fills up. We prefer to sit at the banquette tables overlooking all the action ( there wasn't much this visit ), though the padded seat is getting a bit lumpy. Many diners prefer the closer together tables in the middle of the classic bistro space. We have spotted the occasional celebrity here but most diners are having pre and post theatre dinners. 
Great Covent Garden location.",1
5,"What a wonderful evening -- I owe virtually all of it to the wonderful barman who attended to me. The check says ""sam p"" was serving, so I'm going to say it was sam. 
First, he made an absolutely impeccable martini, and even paused to inquire about my preferred dryness. It was wonderful. I noted the wonderful lemon presence, and he cut a fresh lemon peel and squeezed it over the back of my hand to show me the freshness of lemon oils and the difference they make. Then, when I expressed an interest in the vermouth he used, he very enthusiastically shared their house blend (cocchio + standard dry). 
I mentioned I'd never heard of cocchio, and what followed was a tour de force of making a guest feel special -- he personally walked me through the different kinds of vermouth cocchio makes, their characteristics, their history, their relationship to other aperitifs like Lillet -- and then he gave me a taste of each. 
I mean, not only did I have a great time, enjoy a spectacular martini (and a perfect rare steak frites), but I actually learned something that I can bring home with me. 
I will consider my next trip to London incomplete without a visit to Balthazar for a drink with Sam. 
Sam, you are a gentleman and a scholar. Thanks for a great evening!",1
4,Classic brunch food with a lovely atmosphere. Good portion sizes and if you get the bread basket they give you four different types of jams/spreads for the bread!,1
5,"I've been the the NYC location and had high expectations already going in. And let's just say, I was not disappointed. 
From the friendly service to the food- thumbs up!  Ordered the traditional English breakfast and it was worth every bite. The bacon is not fatty like the one back in the states, the sausage was soft (not chewy), the beans weren't as sweet (which was nice), the fried bread was interesting (not my cup of tea, but nice to try), and my eggs were prepared to perfection.
They also had green juice, which I desperately needed after eating such a heavy meal.",1
5,Great breakfast. Loved the omelette and my friends loved everything else on the menu. Great Food and service. Definitely reccomend.,1
4,"Yummy! Balthazar is a popular choice for me! I usually go in New York, and this was my first time at the London location! It is the same typically as the NY location, but I still love it! The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the wine is flowing! ;) I love it here and it's so yummy! Get the steak frites!!",1
5,"This is my current favorite place for afternoon tea in London. Just don't plan to eat dinner on the same day. Our tea service included 10 tea sandwiches, 4 gorgeous and huge scones with Devonshire cream (of course) and some of the loveliest jam ever, and 5 beautifully crafted and extremely tasty pastries. Oh, there was tea, too. If you're anywhere near Covent Garden, don't miss it.",1
4,"Wonderful restaurant, excellent food, wasn't overly heavy. They have an economical 2or 3 course fixed price option with limited choice.  Wine by the glass had a reasonable selection and moderate price",1
2,"Pretty Disappointed with this place.  The service was decent and the staff was nice so I have no complaints there.  The steak tartare was pretty good.  Sad to say it was all downhill from there... I had the baked cod and my girlfriend had the lobster spaghetti.  While the pasta was properly cooked the seafood in both entrees was brutally overcooked.... Not just a little over done, I mean absolutely terrible.  At over 80 pounds for a lunch I would expect much better.",-1
3,"Meh...
Maybe I'm just a hard sell but my steak could have been more blue and the fries were semi soggy.  The latter was especially disappointing because they are supposed to be really good fries. They were even on ""the best thing I ever ate"" on Food Network as Bobby Flay's pick.
These were not the best thing I ever ate.
Like the New York location, it's crowded (even on a weeknight) so you should definitely make a reservation unless you don't mind sitting at the bar.
Would I go back in London? Probably not. There are better places to eat.",-1
4,"As good as the ones in NYC. Great environment, yummy dishes and good service. What else can you expect from a restaurant? A strong recommend to whoever is looking for a good combo of everything.",1
5,"I had the fortunate experience to enjoy this spot with cousins friends and sisters.  Two separate reservations but the kind hostess was able to put us side by side to accommodate the group of 8.      For starters we ordered Burrata (fresh and amazing)  Beetroot Apple and goat curd salad, not a fan of goat cheese (Fiona and Deb loved )  Pumpkin Agnolotti and scallops were devoured by the second hungry table....  MARY DALE MAUD AND Christine AKA CHISSY ..Our waiter Steve was so kind professional and very accommodating !    We had the pleasure of meeting the manager,  Dominik Powroznik, a gracious host!!",1
4,"A fabulous restaurant with classic decor, and tucked away in Covent Garden. I met a friend here for a late breakfast and catch up and we were not disappointed. We were promptly shown to our table, the waiters are very attentive, and the food came out quickly. My friend had avocado on toast with poached eggs, and I had the scrambled eggs with Cornish crab. Both options were delicious. Tea is served in a large pot, and our water was topped up continuously. They didn't mind that we stayed for a couple of hours talking. This is a good place for intimate dining, though the tables are too close together and you sometimes feel as though the people at the next table can hear everything you say. I would definitely return here.",1
4,"The Balthazar Bakery is located next door to the fabulous restaurant Balthazar. There is a beautiful selection of artisan breads, sweet pastries such as cakes and tarts, sandwiches, and salads that you can either take away, eat there, or have delivered which is free within the WC2 area.  The majority of the bread and croissants are made in house. The shop is small. This is a traditional French bakery...quality not quantity.  Everyone and everything was as wonderful as the restaurant. If you order any fish dishes, ask them to debone the fish...unless you prefer the bones left in the fish.  We had the Daily Special...it was too much work and it ruined the dish and the experience for one of my friends.

4,"While planing to have breakfast in somewhere around Covent Garden we came across this place. In NY Balthazar was in our list, but we did not have time to visit. So without checking the menus outside we just entered in! 
For breakfast, menu is quite extensive but nothing special in comparison to other French cafes/chains/restaurants/bistros. Ah, maybe more expensive! For single eggs royale in Balthazar, I can get eggs royale (w 2 muffins) and drink in my fav places with same price. 
I must note that the waiter was so attentive. I was not sure about to order Le panier -selection of mini pastries and bread basket - he brought the basket to show us what we would receive. Pastries were a bit hard but I liked homemade jams and marmalade. 
Another note is tea pots are big that you can almost have 4 full cups. Nice! 
Nice ambiance, tasty food, I will arrange my next visit soon for dinner.",1
4,"I knew coming to London I had to try Balthazar's. I wasn't able to make it to the one in NYC, so why not? We made a reservation for 8pm and when we got there it was packed! We ended up waiting for about an extra 20 minutes for our table. The restaurant kept apologizing for the wait and were kind enough to offer a bottle of champagne while we waited for our table to clear out(bonus!).  I was just surprised and pleased in a way with the profuse apologies...Not used to it in America! Ha.
I ordered the steak and fries (go figure) that they are known for and everyone else got the special of the day which was a pork belly dish. We also ordered the burrata.  Get the burrata if you love cheese!! Even if you're lactose intolerant, I'd still highly recommend it ;) Don't let me forget to tell you about the fries. Omg. Actually, I take that back. I can't tell you. You just have to try it for yourself. You will seriously feel like you're being whisked away into the clouds while sitting on a bed of fries. That was me.
Besides the wait, I loved it all, and would come back. Great service, awesome decor, and delicious red wine with amazing people :)",1
5,French restaurant with great food and superb service. I had the Duck Sheppard's Pie and my wife had the filet. Food and service were top notch. Super attentive staff. Tables were close together but that didn't bother us at all.,1
5,"Went here with a group of 8 people for dinner on a Tuesday night. Service was attentive and patient with our rowdy lot. We were given bread for the table with some nice tasting butter to accompany it. We started with the oysters which were superb along with ceviche and steak tartare, both delightful. I ordered the sea bass as my main, which I highly recommend! From the silence after we were served, I take it that everyone else enjoyed their meals as well! We ended the night with a few desserts including my fav of the pick which were these cream puff type things filled with ice cream instead of cream...amazing!",1
2,"So many good eating choices, keep looking. The menu was not very exciting. The food was so full of pepper, it was inedible. The cheese plate looked like it was sitting around for a while. The bread was delicious. Servers were busy, the nicest person in the restaurant was the guy who took our credit card.",-1
5,"For breakfast, this place is hard to beat.  It is very similar to the NYC restaurant that it is spawned from; in fact I really felt like I was in New York.  The portions were very American sized, without sacrificing the quality.   I would happily come here every week for brunch.
I tired the English Breakfast and was only able to get through about 2/3 or it so make sure you come hungry.",1
4,"I love a poached egg, and they don't come better than at Balthazar! 
The staff are very friendly and attentive, and although we were initially told it would be a 40 minute wait (we arrived at 11am on a Sunday without a booking), we were seated within 15 minutes. The food took a little while to come but when it finally arrived it was DELICIOUS. I had poached egg & avocado with a side of bacon, the portions were very generous and filling!
It's a little pricier than your average brunch spot, but well worth it. The atmosphere is that a  40s Parisian diner, it definitely injected a hint of sophistication into my Sunday morning hangover.",1
4,"I stumbled in here when looking for somewhere to grab a bite on my lunch break. Not realising where I actually was I ordered the French onion soup and a chicken BLT. 
It took me a few minutes to realise that this wasn't your typical cafe. Bread lined the walls, the cakes on display looked ridiculously good - especially the donuts - and everyone (the staff) was speaking with a French accent! I still haven't sussed if they were real or fake accents yet...
The price for a soup and sandwich was costly (£11!!) but at this moment SO worth it for a warming lunch having been out in the cold for so long. The French onion soup was everything a French onion soup should be and you could tell it had been stewing for quite some time. It also came with some large cheese croutons for dipping - a nice added bonus. Highly recommended.
Then to my sandwich. I was actually rather full from my sandwich so I saved half for Jody but I must say it was a pretty decent sandwich - the bread, as with those hanging on the walls, was fresh and tasty and the fillings distributed well - no sandwich gaps, woo (big pet hate of mine)!
I finally realised, after stuffing my face, that this was the cafe section of infamous Balthazar (which I am yet to visit)... Definitely worth a visit for a nice alternative to the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden and a much cheaper option than the main restaurant itself.",1
1,Awful service. Poor customer experience and utter lack of customer care. Arrived at 11:15 after calling ahead to be told that the kitchen would actually not take orders after 11:15. Awful.,-1
5,"My search for a late breakfast led me today Balthazar Boulangerie just moments from Covent Garden. Pleasant vibe of the area is continued inside with the relaxed yet elegant interior. As a bread lover I had to try their bread selection which was presented in a generous basket (Le Panier in the menu). Alongside the baguette, white and dark bread and a variety of croissants came a choice of small jam jars and some delicious butter. The overall quality was very good and coupled with the pleasant vibe there is really no reason to give less than 5 stars.",1
5,Love the vibes of this spot right off of Covent Garden! It's a must hit while in London. They have a yummy breakfast selection and great coffee. Both the English Breakfast and Eggs Royal are delicious. Don't forget to try a pastry!,1
4,"Came here a few times, though the last time was certainly memorable. As my friend was visiting from abroad and wanted to book a fancy afternoon tea. After trying to balance showing her a good time and me not falling for my usual go-to's including Sanderson and Sketch, I decided to opt for their specialty Bobbi Brown themed experience, since my friend is a huge makeup fan. 
Usually I try to avoid too touristy cliche French Restaurants that attract people for 'impeccably luxury feel' service and overly prices carbs slapped with sauce on a plate. However Balthazar lives to it's reputation with good service and impeccably classic setting and dishes. The themed afternoon tea brings a little more 'edge' and quirkiness to their concept of elaborate dining. 
The restaurant very much reminds me of Cheri in Barcelona. With cloudy yellow lighting to create intimacy, mirrored walls and monochrome marble floors give it that 'socialite' feeling of you being in an occasion spot in Paris in the 1920s. The formally dressed staff just add to the classic feeling of being served in something a bit more exciting than you typical urban bistro full of design enthusiasts with their macs. 
The afternoon tea menu's included savory sandwiches with classic ones such as the cucumber, which is my guilty pleasure. The scones were nearly perfect with a lovely light and airy texture, sweet clotted vanilla team and classic blackberry jam. The highlight of the themed experience were the sweet pastries that were shaped in lips, eyeshadow palette and a mascara. My personal favourite was the yogurt mousse in the shape of lips. The rhubarbs shaped into an eyeshadow in a chocolate cream tart was also a close hit. 
Overall I think this afternoon tea is wonderful quality, considering the price with the perfect atmosphere of fancy dining and being a hot-spot in Soho. It's amazing if you're looking for something in central that offers the traditional afternoon with a themed twist, though nothing overly strange nor experimental. The unlimited offer of tea, cakes and sandwiches available also to take home was a big plus. The professional staff service and atmosphere makes this place a go-to for any fan of French cuisine.",1
4,"Despite living in NYC, I've never actually visited Balthazar in soho, though I do delight in their sticky buns as often as possible. Anyway, we happened upon this location in Covent Garden and decided to dine here. Of course I had the steak frites, and it was sooo good. The meat was a little on the rare side but I like it that way, and the French fries were perfect. I also ordered the salad with butter lettuce and hazelnut - delicious. Great ambience and the staff wears old-fashioned uniforms. Plus, I think the menu was priced less expensively than the NYC one, even with the conversion!",1
4,"grilled langoustines (yabbies) with green tomato salsa, chives and aromatic oil served with Jacob's Creek Reserve Adelaide Hills Chardonnay 2013 - a very light white wine that makes it a great companion to shellfish and white meat seafood - I think I just came up with the term, white meat seafood. I am thinking sea bream, bass, monkfish and halibut. Probably mackarel and tuna would be too strong and cloud the taste of the wine. The wine has also a very strong oak aroma and smoky bouquet that is not present in it's taste. I was glad otherwise it could all be a little too much. 
hot smoked duck with cherries, beetroot and braised lettuce accompanied with an Adelaide Hills Pinot Noir and cherry sauce served with Jacob's Creek Reserve Adelaide Hills Pinot Noir 2013 - with some serious buttered vegetables together with the layer of fat in the duck was, to some, delightful. I only managed one and had to take the other two off because it was just too much. The meat was a little tough and chewy but the intensity of the deep dark cherry sauce was very nice. The wine was easy to drink, very mild tannin that brought out the gameness in the duck.
kangaroo with pepper, cabbage, pancetta and carrot with Barossa Shiraz sauce served with Jacob's Creek Reserve Barossa Shiraz 2013 - It was the best kangaroo meat I've had but I can only compare to Iceland supermarket's frozen kangaroo meat (there, I said it!) and I thought that it was a slightly unfair comparison so I referred to a true Aussie foodie that was there that night. She confirmed that it was very good indeed; so lean and cooked to perfection. It was good with the suggested Barossa but I thought that it was equally good with the Pinot Noir too.
dark chocolate sphere with mint, eucalyptus and a hot chocolate sauce served with Jacob's Creek Reserve Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon 2011 - after seeing so many media videos of chocolate desserts melting when sauce is poured, this was my reality moment. But chocolate sphere did not entirely melt and the waiter was not going to wait for my silly phone camera to come on. Shame...
tea, coffee and petit fours - macaroons, lemon meringue and chocolate were delicious. The cold coffee was not great but these petit fours, especially the lemon meringue, were delicious! I had the last sip of my Chardonnay Pinot Noir Brut NV with this sweet tangy dessert and to mark the end of a wonderful evening.",1
4,"Quick Review:  A French brasserie with an old school steakhouse type of feeling.  Standard dark wood traditional restaurant with great tasting food. Great service, set menu for large groups
FOOD
Escargots (w/ garlic butter): it came with about 6-8 pieces but its a very rich dish so I would say a good enough portion for 1, maybe 2 if you just want to taste.  Shell is included, a little weird if you are not accustomed to eating escargot but very good.
Steak Frites:  the meat was cooked perfectly and the frites were just as tasty, it was VERY well peppered which I didn't mind at all.  
Vanilla Creme Brulee:  yummy custard goodness.  Cracked the torched sugar is always my favorite part of eating creme brulee.
SERVICE
Excellent!  We had a group of 8 very hungry women.  Though we had a set menu (standard for parties over 6), we were still indecisive but our server was a good sport.  He was french and gave his honest opinion about the menu which I can appreciate.  We each got our own dessert but they also brought macarons for the table to share, such a nice gesture.
AMBIANCE
Quaint Parisian restaurant.  Clean, with a good amount of space.",1
4,"Had dinner here on our first night in London. We split pate w/crostini and french onion soup to start. Both were delicious! For main courses, we ordered the beef stroganoff (not traditional with noodles, but served with white rice) as well as the gnocchi with artichokes. We also split a bottle of granache wine. Was't crazy about the beef stroganoff but all other dishes and wine were great! Service was also very attentive and friendly.",1
4,Balthazar is always solid.  The Chicken paillard was super thin and very flavorful.  The baked scallop appetizer was also great and they have an excellent wine list.,1
3,"Main reason for the mediocre review is I felt really rushed though my meal. I can appreciate wanting to ensure I made my show time (reservation at 6pm, show at 7:30), but still I had an appetizer and my main in front of me by 6:20pm... and that was after leisurely looking through the menu! Also, the restaurant itself gave a very cramped feeling. So much so the couple next to me and I commented on it.
The appetizer (octopus, tomato, basil) wasn't exactly flavorful. The main (stone bass) was more up to par with a delicious artichoke purée. 
 
The bottle wine list was very extensive with plenty of French wine to choose from. The wines by the glass had reasonable selection.
All-in-all, I'd say a touch above average for this caliber of a restaurant. If someone brought me back here it'd be ok, but I would seek out another place for myself.",-1
5,Amazing....Beef stroganoff.  It's been a long time since I can remember a meal that got better bite after bite. It was so good I didn't want it to end.  The place appears to have a perpetually long wait (unless you have reservations of course) but I got right in by sitting at the bar.  Wait staff was incredibly responsive (unlike many English restaurants where you have to flag them down).   Very highly recommend.,1
4,"Living away from the US has really made me miss brunch, so one of my agendas in London was to eat brunch (it is no joking matter). As I missed out on going to the SoHo restaurant while I was living in NYC, I redeemed myself (a little bit) by checking out Balthazar in Covent Garden.
To me, the interior is expectedly like an ""Americanized"" French brasserie, and the open dining space with many chatting diners/busy servers made the atmosphere very warm. We were lucky to get a table immediately on a Saturday early afternoon, followed by quick service.
We started with the chicken liver & foie gras mousse as starter. My friends described that it was smooth like cheese spread. We then proceeded with scrambled egg & cornish crab with a side of mushroom fricassée, sweetcorn fritters, avocado on toast with poached eggs, and hazelnut waffles. All the entrees were delicious, and we devoured our dishes in no time.
I am glad that I got my brunch fix.",1
4,"Great ambience and food. Reservations highly recommended. Wine list was considered a bit pricey by somebody in our party, but had good selection. (Or so I was told).
Went for a work function, but seemed like a great date spot, girls night out, or celebrating a special event.",1
5,"I had breakfast here with a friend while we were in London. Great location, easy to find. Lovely restaurant, very upscale. The food was really good. We shared the pastry basket which had more pastries than we could eat. I had the caramelized grapefruit which I'd never tried before. The caramelization took any bite the red grapefruit ya have had, it was very good. The only problem I had in eating it was they didn't provide a grapefruit spoon to dig out the fruit with so it was something of a trial to eat. My friend had the full English breakfast which looked wonderful and she said was terrific. The hostess and wait staff were superb and we lacked for nothing, and didn't have to wait for them to assist unlike most places in Europe. This is not an inexpensive place for breakfast but the prices were reasonable considering what you receive and that London prices are very high anyway. Overall I highly recommend Balthazar's for breakfast or brunch. Next time I'm in London I plan to give it a try for dinner!",1
5,"Another solid London brunch destination. It's a French brasserie, reminding me a lot of Colbert on Sloane Square and some of my favorite brunch places in the US (Parc in Philadelphia and Left Bank in San Jose, CA). The location could not be better (it is right off the Covent Garden Piazza), and the venue is grand and beautiful, with enormously high ceilings and loud jazz music playing throughout. We had a reservation for 2 people, which we managed to get by emailing the restaurant, despite no availability showing up on the online booking system. This is the second time that I've been able to get a reservation this way, so I would highly recommend it if your desired times are not showing up at first glance.
The food and service were also stellar. It was actually just like being back in America. I ordered scrambled eggs & Cornish crab, which came served on a piece of toasted sourdough bread and with a side of creme fraiche. The eggs were wonderfully creamy and the crab was plentiful and just perfect. I could not have been more pleased with it. One piece of toast doesn't seem like an awful lot, but I was so full by the end. My friend got the avocado on toast, but managed to switch out the poached eggs for mushrooms and tomato, since she doesn't really eat eggs. She also asked for some goat cheese, which the staff happily obliged, even though it isn't a standard menu item.
I was very impressed by the whole experience. No complaints about Balthazar and would definitely come again... the rest of their menu looks equally amazing.",1
1,"Although greeted and served by very friendly staff, we found the food ever so disappointing, despite hearing great things about Balthazar London. 
Crammed in between very noisy small, darkly lit tables, our food came out suspiciously fast - within two minutes of ordering. 
The spinach in my eggs florentine was wet, bland and a rather small portion, definitely not worth £13.50, for a bit of bread, veg and hardly any sauce. Sadly nothing special, overpriced and overrated. I could definitely think of better places for brunch in London.",-1
5,"It is a pleasure to review a restaurant like Balthazar.  In a nutshell, the food is excellent and the service is impeccable.
Here are the details:
- Bread - I simply have to start with Balthazar's homemade bread. Every single kind of their bread is spectacular, but I'd like to single out the sun dried tomato olive buns.  5 stars all the way. (Btw, their butter is great too).
- French Onion Soup - very good. Savory, beefy and with a healthy amount of gryere, very intense.  One minus - too much bread in the actual soup, which sucks up a lot of the liquid, making the soup a little dryer than I'd like to.  That said, still a solid 4.5 star dish.
- Escargots - very good, garlicky, buttery and just yummy.  5 stars.
- Garlic Shrimp - the shrimp is good, but the sauce it comes in is out of this world.  It has a slight kick due to the addition of chili peppers.  5 stars.
- Mac & Cheese.  Very creamy and not as intense as I expected it to be.  Made with gryere. It deserves 4.5 stars, and the reason I'm not giving it full 5 stars is because it was the least memorable dish I had.
- Burgers - Very good burger, cooked to a perfect medium rare but not the best burger (not even in the vicinity) I ever had.  The meat was excellent quality but underseasoned.  Two other major issues: 1. Bun - too big and 2. the patty is on the smaller side.  For that size of the bun, the beef patty has to be at least twice that size. 4 stars.
- Beef Tartare - Excellent! Prepared ""au couteau"" (hand cut), well seasoned with the slightly higher note of acidity.  Add some hot sauce a freshly ground black pepper for a heavenly concoction. 5 stars.
- Moules Mariniere (mussels) - great.  Fresh and fenomenal. 5 stars.
- Rubharb Souffle - WOW! With a side of creme anglaise this was the home run of the evening. 5stars and it doesn't do it justice.
- Small dessert pastries - every single one was better than the other.  The macrons, the cream filled dark chocolate  and the chocolate filled cookie cups. 5 stars!
I hope you'll enjoy Balthazar as much as I did.",1
5,"Best. Eggs. Florentine. Ive. Ever. Had. 
Gorgeous french looking brasserie. Although an american chain, so included a special 4th july menu and of course pancakes, this is actually supposed to be a french brasserie. With great choice of french dishes. 
Had the eggs florentine - and honestly best ones ive even had! And ive tried quite a few places! Everything was perfect - the spinach, the muffin , the poached runny eggs and that hollandaise sauce!!
Definitly want to go back and try more things, if everything is as good as those eggs!!! Miam miam!!",1
3,"You know, I expected it to be better, much better.
I've been to the one in NYC and it is an institution so was looking forward to trying the London version of this cosmopolitan French styled bistro. It looks very much like the one in downtown New York, but much bigger and along with that it loses some of its intimacy. What was imported across the pond was a good helping of New York type attitude. The service was a bit cold and always seemed to be bored with whatever was said or asked for. Our waitress could barely be bothered to help with the wine when I asked if they had a Bordeaux by the glass she seemed confused. There also seemed to be the bare minimum of interest shown while just getting the job done properly. 
The food was good but not amazing. You would think that a pretty straight forward Steak Frites with Bearnaise would be delicious in a place like this.  It was fine, but lack luster. Starting with the meat which was not cooked the way asked more medium than medium rare, and also not the best cut of meat. The Bearnaise was a bit thin and vinegar-y, overall just a bit off and not what you would expect. Dessert of Tarte Tartin was delicious though.
Nice enough, and for Covent Garden Piazza a bit of an oasis if you want something a bit more upmarket. The bar makes a great place for pre opera drinks.",-1
4,"Comes close to their NY restaurant, offers a good vibe to eat in, fairly loud but not too loud you have to shout. People eat there late so the room is well filled. Food was good, had the raw seafood tower and the steak. Only slight negative was the service which was good and friendly but seemed they could have had a couple less tables to cover to provide a quciker response. All in all, this restaurant is good place for a date or drinner with friends/family.",1
5,"I came here for a solo lunch on a Tuesday afternoon, with no reservations, and I was seated promptly. 
I had half a dozen oysters to start, which came with a choice of two salsas/vinaigrette to spoon on the oysters, but I asked for Tabasco anyway. Oysters were fresh - no complaints. I do wish the bread they served prior was freshly baked...
I asked for a recommendation for my main, and oh boy! My waiter recommended the plate du jour, which was vaguely described to me as pork belly. I do love a good pork belly so I went along with it. Goodness gracious me! The pork belly arrived, on a bed of poached greens, with the skin crispy and slightly sweet, and there was additional pork crackling on top, and blood pudding on the side. They didn't forget a sauce, and to go with all that goodness, puréed apple was hiding somewhere to complement the pork perfectly. Despite the sheer amount of pork elements on the plate, it wasn't overly porky and there was a lot of difference within these elements to wow me. Party in my mouth, it was. 
Loads of places can do a decent pork belly. But not many places can combine it with other pork elements, and do the classic pork and apple combination to a T. I didn't get dessert because I was stuffed, but I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here.",1
3,"A beautiful large, French bistro in Covent Garden with tablecloths and waiters in uniform. Service is attentive but the waiters are particular about their respective areas so you can't call on a different waiter even if yours is busy.
We went here for lunch: grilled salmon on warm spinach, walnut and lentil salad; club sandwich with frites; basket of warm fresh bread. All delicious and fairly large portions. Very quick to bring to the table. Maybe we didn't order the right things but they weren't particularly special. The chips were very bright yellow which made me the think the oil may not have been the best. I enjoyed the club sandwich despite it falling apart in my hands because of the soft French sourdough loaf bread used. Two lunch mains for £38 is a bit steep but good if you're in the area and looking for somewhere fairly refined to eat.",-1
5,"It was date night and my husband and I have been wanting to try Balthazar in Covent Garden.  Balthazar was a classic in NYC and I was very excited to try it here in London.
Food: We started off with the onion soup which was ok and the escargots which were top notch.  For our mains we ordered the lamb rump and the moules frites.  Both were good.  I also had a side of onion rings (why not!) and they were delicious!
Drinks: We ordered one glass of champagne and one glass of white wine.
Price: 100.69 GBP for two people.
Ambiance: The restaurant feels just like NYC.  Bustling with energy.
Service: You felt a good vibe as soon as you walk into the door.  Everyone from the hostess, the bartender, and to our server was friendly and attentive.  One of the guys dropped a few plates at our table and about five different people came to apologise.  They brought us two glasses of champagne which I thought was a nice gesture for the broken plates.
Would I go back?  Definitely, especially for the escargots.  They have so many great things on the menu that I already know what I want to order next time.",1
4,really good brunch menu. everything tastes fresh. friendly service. i would definatily go back.,1
4,Brilliant brasserie! Had some epic brunches here. The wine list is broad and the service is great. Definitely recommended.,1
5,"Although the food is terrific and delicious, the
service is spectacular. Waiters and bus boys are
Superb. It is a treat to meet delightful people
from a variety of countries. All were fluent in
English but we enjoy using our limited language
Skills in French and Spanish. Tonight will be our
third meal this week! My wife Caro' will return
next week for an encore!",1
4,"This is a popular spot at all times of day. Great spot to catch up with friends. Atmosphere is lively, classy but not overly pretentious. 
Visited in the lead up to Xmas so the festive decor was up but even without it it has a dramatic grand appeal. 
Initially tried to get a table for lunch without a reservation but nothing was free. Turned up again, hopeful, two hours later and got a table for four easily. 
Front of house was great and waiters were perky and professional. Toilets were very clean but a bit tricky to reach, staff were on hand with helpful directions. 
Food ranged from usual French options of onion soup to extravagant veal. I opted for a macaroni and cheese dish which was just right. My friends ordered steak and cheeseburger meals all very tasty. Terrific place.",1
4,"I really liked the atmosphere and interior design in this restaurant. My friends and I went for brunch, so I ordered pancakes and some poached eggs as a side. Both were delicious. The service was good, not great, but we had a nice time regardless. I look forward to returning for lunch or dinner sometime.",1
5,It is just like in New York. They have this French decoration with a really nice food and beautiful decoration..,1
4,"I came here for brunch to meet a local friend. After a 9 mile (15km) run, I was HUNGRY.
My friend beat me here, and had a reservation. When I arrived, the place was bustling, and I was quickly shown to the table. 
Service was friendly and helpful, but not overly so.
I had the duck shepherds pie. The shredded duck was perfectly tender, and full of flavor. If I hadn't just done such a long workout, I probably could not have finished, but I was pretty famished, and I ate every bite.
My friend got the avocado toast, which looked amazing. 
Great ambiance... high ceilings, large windows which bring in a lot of natural light, and well decorated.
The bathroom is up a steep flight of stairs, but has room for several people.
It seems pretty busy, so I would suggest a reservation.",1
4,"Balthazar is so difficult to book for dinner and brave it by trying to get a table for walk-in. We ended up waiting ovee two hours for a table! So i do recommend to get a table booking. Was it worth it? Well I wouldnt do it again but since it is one of those place I have been wanting to try ever since it open then of course it was worth it for the first time!
As a French brasserie you will find steak, French onion soup and one of my favourite Escargots. There are not many places in London that I have tried that does it well. Balthazer escargots was nice and better than other place. But it just does not compare with ones I had at Galvin bistrot de luxe which comes in a wonderful garlic butter sauce that you want to scoop off with bread.
Balthazar serves two different pie including a duck pie which is very rich in flavour. The one I recommend and the dish that I give a big thumb up has to be the Fish Pie. This was true comfort food and an indulgent to have for dinner. It has to be my best fish pie I have had in London.
You can not leave with out ordering the soufflés. It is £10 each but they are big enough to share between two people. The waiter who was serving was friendly and a laugh. Even before our soufflés arrive he explain how to eat it - make an indentation at the top and pour the creme in to it. Then you ready to enjoy a light raspberry soufflé. I have to say that this was the only reason I have been wanting to visit Balthazar!
Fish Pie and Soufflés is what I would want to visit Balthazar! Delicious!",1
4,"Solid food and friendly service. 
I had the steak frites which came slightly overdone from medium-rare but it's a minor detail. It was tasty and the fries were very good. 
My friend ordered the sea bass en papillote which was perfectly cooked. 
Wine was delicious and reasonable. We got glasses of the Corbières for £6.50 each. 
It's a lovely setting to have a meal. They took a lot of time with the decor from the low lightening and distressed mirrors in the dining room to the awesome tiling in the bathroom. It makes got a decadent experience!",1
5,"Good service, nice milieu, and above all great food. I had chicken parfait for starters and ox cheek for main course. Both were nearly perfect.",1
5,"I loved you in NYC and I love you in London....
I started off with the Escargot and loved it, but then again, its just a vessel for garlic and parsley. Nom.  And my husband had the Onion soup which must've been amazing because he ate it before I could get a taste in. He said it was the best he thinks he's ever had. Trust... he's had many. 
Followed by the FILLET DE BOEUF AU POIVRE with pommes frites and spinach, it was downright great! So peppery, perfectly cooked. Just splendid. My husband had the grilled salmon which he wasn't too happy about. He was expecting grilled marked but it looked more like steamed than anything else and also was lacking in salt n pepper. 
For dessert I had the most incredible party in my mouth thanks to the Apple Tart Tatin.... OH MY GAWD! I will have to go back just for that. its so good. 
So good!",1
2,Food mediocre.  In our case Wiener Schnitzel just horrible.  Wine by the carafe reasonable. Service only OK.,-1
5,"After searching for a place to have brunch in both Angel and Convent Garden with no luck whatsoever, my friends and I decided to try balthazar as it was 1:20pm and hungry. Although we waited for 15 mins (to be fair we were told it would be a 20 mins wait) we got seated and ordered. I opted for the eggs royale but was told by the chef via a waiter that it contained alcohol which i'm allergic to. I was told the chef would try to create a sauce but it didn't go well - again, i was told. I honestly tried the dish and it tasted dry as it needed hollandaise sauce to give it that special oomph. My friends could see my distress and garnered the attention of a staff and I was given the menu to make a whole new order. I opted for the ""avocado and eggs"" dish as recommended by the chef. The tomato salsa was to die for and hopefully I'll get to recreate the dish as everything worked undeniably well.
PS: To the staff at balthazar, sorry if I came off rude but I was extremely famished.",1
4,"I have finally tried Balthazar after lusting after them for some time now. I came late night with no reservations and they where able to squeeze a party of 2 in with only a 20 min wait. The Porn Star cocktail was beautiful. I was not starving so I didn't go for a heavy plate. I ordered the Moules Frites. I feel like I can't give it 5 stars as mussels are pretty easy to make and a place that can't cook Mussels and French fries probably shouldn't be in the food business. It is pretty hard to ruin that dish. 
I did try a bite of my friends Beef Fillet Stroganoff and it was devine! I have never had Stroganoff before as the name alone never appealed to me but wow! what have I been missing out on?!? I also tried her Chocolate Fondant, I don't even like chocolate but wow! Just wish they served more vanilla ice cream with this dish as I have never seen so little ice cream on a plate. Overall this place is a solid 4 stars in my book!",1
4,"This is for the grab and go side which had a beautiful pastry display (wanted it all). Had a Chelsea roll which was delicious. Really friendly staff as well.
Particularly love the NY'ers asking if this was the original location. Speaking to the great branding on balthazars part.  the staff very politely informed them NY was the original.",1
4,"This was one of my top choices when my partner and I visited London. Overall, I was not disappointed. The restaurant, decked out for the holidays, was bright, cheerful and bustling with an energetic crowd (bar was packed). 
We arrived 20 minutes early and the hostess, without asking, graciously arranged for us to be seated 10 minutes sooner.
Started with the French onion soup, which I had read, was highly recommended. The gruyere  cheese was bubbling and browned and when my spoon broke through its lovely surface, a flavorful (but not at all salty) broth with plentiful onions and bread awaited. I would have been satisfied eating just this, but I had to try the steak friites, which also did not disappoint. Fries did not overwhelm me, I must confess. They were a little undercooked and not seasoned enough, but the steak itself was fantastic.
Of note was also the side of green beans with shallots. I devoured them with the steak. They were the perfect accompaniment to the steak.
We did not save room for dessert but the plates looked great we saw going to other tables.
London has definitely become more of a destination for dining in recent years and this restaurant is one that helped to turn the tide. I look forward to checking out the New York location and will definitely return to this one next time I am in London.",1
5,"Despite being in the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden, Balthazar provides a relaxed and friendly environment for a delicious meal - and they even serve decent coffee.
It took me quite a bit until I made it to Balthazar in Covent Garden, but one afternoon I finally managed to go there. A few months ago, I read a rather interesting article about the New York company and ever since wanted to gain some first-hand experience. Usually, Balthazar was always very busy when I considered visiting, but on this late Sunday afternoon, it was easy to secure a table.
Supposedly, the London branch is almost a 1:1 copy of the New York venture. I cannot  verify this, but I can tell you that the main dining room is huge and grand, with heigh ceiling and some vintage coolness. The rose-inspired lamps hanging everywhere are cute, while also pretty kitschy. And in case you want to know, the toilets are beautiful, too.
I started my late lunch with a lemonade. And what a lemonade! It was kind of a bespoke service, freshly pressed and delivered with a supply of cold water, like a do-it-yourself drink where I could decide how much water or sugar I wanted to add. The waiter was overly friendly and I instantly liked the place after this great start. He and his colleagues continued to impress by topping up my water seamlessly throughout my stay.
I went for the cheese burger with fries and crispy bacon. It was a mighty and pretty messy beast. After I had removed the tomato, the gherkin and the onion, the burger became much more compact and shrank down to a size I could handle. Still messy, but manageably messy.
Initially, I wondered why I was offered no condiments. As I ate my way through the massive burger, I noticed that all kinds of delicious juices  and sauces were oozing out and my plate quickly became the right place to dip my fries, no need for additional condiments. 
The fries also deserve a separate mention. The thin-cut potato strips were golden, crispy, superbly spiced and overall delicious.
To complete my meal, I ordered the profiteroles. This dessert was surprisingly big, packed with lots of ice cream and a dark, strong chocolate sauce.
After all this food, I felt really full and decided to do something about this and concluded my visit with a coffee. I was happy when I learnt that they use Monmouth coffee - a staple choice in the London coffee landscape, and they are almost neighbours in Covent Garden. 
I must say, that I was very satisfied with the food and service at Balthazar in London. Really a place I can recommend, even though the location makes it come across as a tourist trap.",1
5,"Great restaurant with many mouthwatering options on the menu. Could be tough to get a table at dinner time, so make sure you make a reservation. I was dining alone and a seat at the bar was perfect. Its not a place where you need to dress up...but don't show up in a t-shirt, you'll just feel out of place. Very friendly service.",1
3,"Sat at the bar which I was happy to get as a walk-in on a busy Sunday.  But I don't recommend it. The bar is particularly uncomfortable mostly because the counter does not extend out enough to get your knees under it properly.  Also no hooks for bags and purses so where are you supposed to put those things? Wayyy down on the floor is where.  You will also be jostled by people waiting behind you as you eat. I had the fines herb omelet which was fine and came with a side salad that was unmemorable and an equally unexceptional pain au chocolat. All in all a big ""meh."" I might return and sit at a table and have something at which excel.  Maybe.",-1
4,"One of my favorite NYC restaurants and the hype of 'designed to be identical to NYC' we had to check this place out and make our assessment as loyal NYC patrons. 
Result: Pretty Damn Amazing. When greeted at the door our jaws dropped and we were impressed at the likeness of the NYC look and feel. The gentleman host said to me the only difference you'll see is outside there are black cabs instead of yellow ones and then he offered to paint one yellow... now that's service. LOL
On 2 March we were transported to a mini-NYC at Balthazar after tapping redial 24 times we were about to feast! I can appreciate my fellow yelper, Kate H.'s experience of 137 attempts to get a table. I realized I needed to modify the reservation which resulted in 67 calls. CRAZY but this was a must-try for myself and some special New Yorker friends.
Everything was great and aside from a few opening hiccups (all places go through them) the staff gave us a great night. I started off with the winter kale salad followed by the linguini ""Fruits De MeR"" and both were quite good. There were 8 of us and we had two reservations since they were only taking a max of 6 per table. The staff was so kind to try and seat us close together however we ended up with a round table and managed to get everyone seated cozily in the same place. There were many great dishes served up at our table, rock oysters, salad niçoise, côte de boeuf, duck and stone bass. One person's only minor complaint was the stone bass was already deboned. (personally I find that a bonus) However he prefers to demonstrate his skills of removing it as one piece before enjoying and like I said minor thing. Each person said they enjoyed their meal and would recommend it.
Due to the newness of everything serving times were a tiny bit delayed but when you have great company it doesn't get noticed as much. So after bottles of champagne, red wine, fabulous food and yes, dessert followed by dessert wine our time at Balthazar came to a close. The restaurant is beautiful and the food was very good. I'm sure with time their service and delivery times will improve. One of the managers was kind enough to drop by and chat with us. She was visiting from the NYC restaurant and helping get London on track. I look forward to my next dining experience at Balthazar and I'm almost certain you'll enjoy it as well. Cheers to a little piece of America right here in London y'all!",1
5,"I've been to Balthazar last Sunday for a quick brunch with my love and I've been immediately surrounded from the elegant atmosphere, It has been a pleasure taste the rich and elaborate food they served in elegance and accuracy. Share the experience with my love it was great. I really suggest the place for also the accurate list of alcoholic and non alcoholic cocktails they have. Thank you again.",1
5,"I loved the New York version of this restaurant when I lived across the pond, so I was really interested to try out the London version that seemed to be years in the making. I met two friends with whom I had been the NY version - just so we could compare notes! 
Walking in, I thought I was back in New York. It is almost identical! 
I had the snails to start with - they were delicious (well, they were unbelievably garlicky - which is about all you want from snails really). I actually swapped a snail or two for a couple of my friend's oysters - also really really scrummy (the oysters, not my friend. although she is pretty hot to be fair). I then followed up with Chicken Paillard, which was damn near perfect. 
You know what I like most about Balthazar though? It's French cuisine, in London, run by Americans. This means that the food is exquisite, I can get to it without boarding a plane or an international train and the service is bloody excellent. Really, they can't do enough for you - which is such a pleasant change when ordering French food!",1
2,"This is a fancy food factory. The dining room is quite nice, but there are two main problems with this place:
1) The service: everything goes too fast. It is very clear that they have been instructed to get as many seatings in as possible. You barely get to sit down before someone is there to take your order, the main course comes directly after the first course, and they start clearing the table before you have finished. That being said, the staff are all very nice.
2) The food: I got a steak which wasn't bad, but not something very good either. The chips which came as a side was like McDonald's chips with less salt. An with that came a bernaise sauce which isn't really worth mentioning.
I have had far worse dining experiences, but it doesn't change the fact that this is tourist trap although of the better kind.",-1
4,"we had brunch at balthazar and enjoyed our time immensely.  our friend was a  wee bit late so we started with the champagne and OJ (ok less OJ), and had the chicken liver pate, which was delicious and smooth !  We then went on to order the crab and scrambled eggs, delicious and fresh as well as the duck confit -- OMG that was the star -- fall off the bone yummy!! 
decor was great -- loved the distressed large mirrors -- beautiful!  and the SERVICE! they were so great --  gracious and welcoming.  Love that place :)",1
5,"So swanky, so glam - the attempted Shoreditch hipster in me was waiting to find something wrong at Balthazar.  A lot of the staple London must-eats have disappointed in times past. But alas. This was the real deal.
My partner booked us a spot for my Sunday Birthday lunch here. We received a perfect corner table tucked in, in the middle of the restaurant - a perfectly romantic setting.
Despite the restaurant being full - of families, couples, etc. the acoustics were great and it was easy to carry on a conversation. From a service perspective, everyone was really attentive, providing space to enjoy our meal but always coming over to keep the champagne flowing.
For food, my partner went for the eggs benedict and I opted for the eggs norwegian. We shared escargot to start. The eggs were made absolutely perfect, in fact I'm now convinced that almost every other brunch place I've ever been to needs a lesson on ""how to make the proper egg"".  Once our plates were delivered, we opted to have some bread from the bakery with our meal (as opposed to the basket which just seemed like too much food with everything else) - and yes, save space for the bread if you want a little taste of France with your meal.
The escargot in garlic butter was pretty much one of the best starters I've ever tried. I've attempted to now order it (thinking it was my new thing) at other restaurants since, but nothing has compared. Highly recommended even if you don't fancy yourself and escargot eater, or are trying it for the first time (though be warned...it will never be the same after). 
In short, make a special occasion with someone special and go!",1
3,"I went to Balthazar years ago in New York and really like it, and I was happy to find in in London right at the heart of Covent Garden. You get that French Bistro feel as soon as you walk into the restaurant. They have a lovely display of fresh seafood: lobsters, crabs, shrimps and, of course, oysters. 
The menu here is big and quite French, so if you are in the mood for steak tartare, escargots, duck and steak and frites, you have come to the right place. Since the restaurant is in London, you can also have some British flair, like a duck shepherd's pie. We must not forget the daily specials. The evening we went was a Sunday, so I went for the ox cheek bourguignon, because the server highly recommended it to me. It was adequate but not great. The sauce was way too heavy and instead of the flavor Burgundy wine, I just tasted salt. However, the meat was well cooked. I think next time I will not ask for the waiter's recommendation and just stick with steak and frites.",-1
4,"Balthazar is a french brasserie set in the heart of Covent Garden. Lovely atmosphere and decor - great to take a date or your visiting guests from abroad.  The food is of a high standard - the duck confit was as good as we have sampled in France.  The afternoon tea was good value at £25 compared to the high end hotels such as the Ritz or Claridges; scones were delightful and the patisseries beautifully presented. The sandwiches were rather average and dry though.
During the day, the venue is casual enough for children however the acoustics of the room means it gets very noisy. There were large groups of ladies-who-lunch, sipping their tea and we felt slightly out of place in the grand settings.  Highchairs available, tables a little tightly packed to house buggies. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly - top marks there.

5,"I just had the perfect Bloody Mary. Never mind how insanely great my breakfast was (which it was). Perfect Bloody Mary. I've never even considered that there could be a perfect Bloody Mary. It's just the brunch drink. But swear to god, first sip of this and the entire world brightened up.",1
5,"The London balthazar is even better than the new York balthazar!! I had a soup, sandwich and chocolate tart a SD they are delicious! I had a quiche (was not a big fan) and another chocolate rocher and that was awesome! They have mint water which is refreshing!",1
4,"I was so keen to try out Balthazar in London, as I'm a fan of the NYC Original. I was not let down either.
The only blip was slightly slow service between the starters and entrees otherwise, this is a solid 4 star place.
They have managed to capture the NYC buzz within the restaurant, likely courtesy of it being in the middle of tourist central or as I also suspect, it's the damn good food and service in here.
This is an exact replica of the NYC original and we were seated promptly. I needed to try the Escargot since it's been a while since I had them - queue NYC Balthazar. DELISH!! They were so lovely, I thought each was cooked individually - not one chewy mollusk in the bunch.
Onto the scallop & courgette risotto...creamy, morish goodness. The scallops were melt in your mouth goodness. The vodka cocktail washed all of  it down nicely.
My mates had a variety of dishes and all were tucking in heartily too. Not an empty or unsatisfied stomach among us. Compliments to the chef, the helpful and friendly waitstaff and our lovely waitress.
If you haven't been and need a NYC or faux Parisian fix of coolness get in there!",1
5,"Delicious brunch. I had the scrambled eggs with sourdough toast and Cornish crab, which was absolutely divine. It's not the cheapest, but certainly not too expensive. It's a popular spot so quite busy, but we still felt like we had our privacy. Bonus points for the posh bathrooms. Would definitely go back and highly recommend.",1
3,"This was in all likelihood going to be the review that got away. I've spent time in the original Balthazar and had some lovely lunches but, especially in a white hot, can't get a table for love nor money, opening period, I'd resigned myself to forgetting about the London branch. And anyway, who really wants to go to the London branch of a slavish New York recreation of a traditional French bistro? I could be on the Eurostar before they'd answered the reservations line.
As it goes, it's reasonably quiet, even on a Thursday lunch, and therefore the perfect spot to slide into a banquette opposite the International Man of Mystery. He's never sure which city he's in at any given point in time, so this level of high class generic internationalism is perfect for him.
It's not cheap, their range of French classics, but if you've come here deliberately you know that and are comfortable paying £24 for a plate of Steak Frites and £17 for a burger. If you're a wall-eyed tourist who has just stumbled across its prime Covent Garden location then congratulations. You're going to be fleeced, but in a much more pleasant way than if you'd wound up in the Angus Steak House.
Get a back wall booth if you can, perfect for people watching amidst the monied buzz and much, much more room than on the cramped banquettes filling the centre of the room.
After being spoilt by their homemade bread, the ceviche starter was utterly underwhelming, a few rings of squid or octopus in a vinegary coleslaw of mandolined bell peppers and onion. From a distance it looked perfectly pleasant, but ended up being pushed around the plate.
Confit duck on the other hand was perfect. Rich and unctuous, it fell off the bone like a dark brown silk dressing gown sliding from a dressmakers dummy. Definitely a contender for comfort dish of the year, though at the price it bloody well should be.
It's a lovely cavernous space, with decent food slightly over-assiduous staff (that'll be the New York influences rather than the French) but for the money, the ambience and the attitude, I'd much rather be in Zedel, sucking down champagne with the money I've saved on my steak. If it's a power lunch that I need, then I'll be back at the Wolesley first.",-1
5,"On a freezing night in November, some friends and I stepped in for what we thought would be one beverage. 
The ambiance is warm and the wait staff was knowledgeable and enjoyable, so we ended up sticking around for hours. 
We sat in the bar area so I don't have insight on the food, but I was served good whisky and great conversation. 
Tip: the bathroom is upstairs and tricky to access with anyone else, so it's not recommended to travel in packs.",1
2,"Went for Saturday brunch.
Coffee was great, but my meal was blasé.  No one else at my table seemed to be all that jazzed about their meals, either.  I ordered the New York pancakes and, to be clear, these pancakes are not 'New York' pancakes, nor is there any such thing, for that matter.  They are, perhaps, an attempt at American-style pancakes, but that's about it.  In any event, this New Yorker who arrived with an appetite for some heavenly pancakes wasn't impressed with the effort.  Folks who enjoy more of a Dutch-style pancake (mmmm, lekker!), for example, would also be greatly disappointed in this effort.  They just weren't good pancakes in any regard.  Fairly decent pancakes are just so easy that to get them all wrong speaks volumes of a restaurant's kitchen.  
I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs, and the eggs arrived barely above room temperature and, as with the pancakes, were fairly bland and disappointing.  Again, eggs are not astrophysics in the world of culinary arts, so c'mon Balthazar.  Get it together.
As a side note, I'm really tired of these otherwise fabulous U.S. restaurants and businesses (Balthazar, Shake Shack, Whole Foods) opening up spots in London, getting a ton of business from their reputation in the U.S., but then half-@ssing it over here in the UK and getting away with serving sub-par dishes that would make most of the kids back in the States grimace, and certainly the New York crowd.
In sum, Balthazar London is just no match for the New York location, and not even close.  In fact, I don't think that Balthazar would have ever made a name for itself if the dishes flying out of its New York kitchen were as boring as those at its London location.  Such a shame.",-1
3,"I'm a big fan of Balthazar in New York, so was over to the moon to hear one had opened in Covent Garden. While the look and feel of the restaurant is similar to the original in NYC, it's lacking a little something that I can't quite put my finger on.   While the food is nice, it can be a little bland - the burger for example, at £17 you'd hope for something with a little more pizzazz. But it's a cute little stop off if you fancy grabbing a coffee and one of their lovely pastries. You can sit in a little area by the bar, do some people watching, not break the bank.   The real winner here is the bread & desserts (not at the same time) - which I know may sound odd, but it's certainly one to try. The Pavlova is lovely.",-1
5,"I love the fact that this place was totally abuzz at 10:45 on a Friday eve.  Most places in London are shutting down and shooing you out, but not here.  Here we were welcomed in with open arms to be served and fed and not rushed out even as they were closing.
Great traditional French menu and wine.  Bring on the escargot, steak tartare and dauphinoise s'il vous plait!",1
4,"With Shake Shack, 5 Guys, and Balthazar all in the same area, I wouldn't be surprised if American restaurants slowly infiltrate Covent Garden the way Chinatown did to Little Italy in Manhattan.  Bring over Trader Joe's, and then we'll talk.
Despite the quick seating and the fabulous service, I never really understood the hype of Balthazar in New York either.  I loved its baked goods, but I was never blown away by their food.  Same with my experience at Balthazar in London.  Bf's Balthazar Bar Steak (16 quid) was tender and juicy, my 22 quid bouillabaisse (a special only on Friday) was delicious, but it's definitely more of a place to be seen and checked out, rather than a place you'd go for your anniversary.
Do, however, get the 10 quid raspberry souffle, even if it takes 10 minutes to make. I would skip the clafouftis as it was pretty dense.",1
5,"Came to their cafe in search of some awesome baked goodies for lunch -- and walked away thrilled!
I had a sticky bun and the salami/mozzarella/tomato (or something like that) sandwich on a potato-onion roll -- loved both of them. The sticky bun is both dense, chewy, and perfectly flaky, with rich flavor and texture. The sandwich was also quite flavorful and the bread certainly unique! 
A friend bought a scone box (which was actually rather well-priced) and I've a mind to go back to try it later.
Staff are very friendly and seem to really enjoy working there (and like interacting with the tourists). Definitely go!",1
4,"Came in on a Monday evening 7pm with 3 other girlfriends without a reservation. We were seated promptly without a wait-- we're off to a great start! Our waiter was knowledgable about the specials and was helpful without being too pushy. The restaurant itself is grand. High ceilings, chandeliers, wine bottles were lined up on the wall of the bar, and a plethora of fresh oysters and shrimp were displayed on ice. 
I started off with a chicken liver/foie gras appetizer. Very generous portions and tasty. For the main, I ordered the grilled dover sole and it was perfectly cooked! My friends ordered the lobster spaghetti, salmon, and steak frites and they all enjoyed their dishes as well. If I wasn't a broke college student, I would have ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert-- it sounded divine!
Balthazar is a great place to people watch and treat yourself. The ambience is ornate, the service is wonderful and prompt. A little pricy, but I'd definitely come back!",1
4,"The plan was to come here for a late Saturday Brunch and get some eggs. We arrived to find a queue but had looking booked, so we went straight through. After we walked in and were seated I managed to glimpse so amazing dishes which made me think twice about the original plan. I ended up going for the burger. Cooked to preference, with a great homemade sauce and bun. It also came swimming in a sea of French fries. Normally I wouldn't complain but maybe it was a bit too much as I don't like to waste food. My partner stuck to the original plan and got a cheese omelette. I tried this also but it was overly cheese and quite small. Coffee was also top notch. Staff were very friendly, attentive when needed but let you get on with your meal in peace. (Visit - 09/05/2015 Lunch)",1
4,"*Bolsheviks beware, seriously bourgeois review is brewing along with the coffee*
______________
Sometimes I just love being bourgeois.
Frothy coffee and pricey pastries quelquefois, really is the only way to start the day, darling.
If, like myself you were sheepishly excited at the expansion of Keith McNally's faux-Français New York establishment into exciting new territory (London), yet were NOT terribly thrilled about the prospect of hitting redial on the phone every minute for three days in vain expectation of securing a dining reservation (I mean I have so many better things to do with my precious bourgeois time, right) the Balthazar Bakery located right next the the restaurant proper may be a nice solution for a coy little indulgence - experience the atmosphere sans the wait.
Having lived a block away from the original restaurant-bakery duet in Soho NYC (I know, how bourgeois), I was of course excited to relive my (occasional) self-spoiling mornings and thus decided to breakfast à la Balthazar aujourd'hui. I was not disappointed. In fact, I was exuberantly delighted to sample their twist on a classic croque monsieur [soused in béchamel-sauce finished with Lea-and-Perrins lacerations]- the textural experience was sumptuously akin to that initial and rather glorious creme-caramel fracturing moment. I'm afraid biting through the crispy, grilled bread surface into the soft layering of jambon et fromage interior, is simply worth the excessive £4.50 it demands.
Bien sûr, the usual boulangerie window-pageant of baked goods is certainly inviting, and the gleaming white-tiled walls bedecked with cursive 'B'-inscribed wholemeal loaves exude a constructed charm one only thought possible in a Hollywood studio (you have ACTUALLY been to Paris, yah). Though I would even be so bold as to suggest that the B-B London even trumps its NYC predecessor in terms of the open space and ability to convince its patrons that they are actually there to shop (market-style) rather than just queuing for a costly caffeine and butter-filled petit déjeuner, distributed in a somewhat nonchalant and brusque manner (although that would probably be the most authentically French thing about it).
Bon appetit, comrades.",1
4,"Had the Chopped Salad along with onion rings, my other guests had the Salad Nicoise and the giant Mac and Cheese. The Mac and Cheese was particularly awesome. Great way to transition back from great French vacation food to good US fare...",1
4,"We had such a positive experience here, I can't wait to take the rest of our family back. My daughter and I were shopping in Covent Garden and we stopped for lunch at the bar.  I had a delicious chopped salad and the manager and bartender were so kind to chat with us and make a special crepe for my daughter who was hoping for the pancakes.  I lived in NYC for 7 years and used to love going to Balthazar.  This one is equally as great--fabulous atmosphere, staff and food--a few of the people at the bar were clearly regulars and it felt like Cheers--where everybody knows your name.",1
5,"Happy dance for one of my favorite NYC staples making its way to London!
For the entire three years that I've been living in London, I've been hearing rumblings of the prodigal son, Keith McNally bringing his French brasserie juggernaut across the Atlantic. And with much fanfare and panache, the will-he-won't-he speculation finally ended last Monday evening. They're currently only open for dinner service, but brunch and lunch service is coming soon. 
After 137 tries (thanks, iPhone for keeping track) to get through the booking line last Friday morning, my fortitude was rewarded with an opening week dinner spot. So, last night we sat down for an early-ish dinner, that is very much what I remember from back home. 
The staff is an eclectic mix of London's restaurant service elite; NYC Balthazar linchpins; and an eclectic mix of French servers representing the best of The Hexagon's diverse regions. It's an impressive bunch! 
The American hospitality smacks you in the face as soon as you walk through the door. At first blush, it can be a bit much for those of us used to the cold shoulder presented at so many London establishments. But we acclimated almost immediately--it sort of made me miss home. Sigh.
Water appeared via busboy -- what!?. Our Breton waiter brought us expertly made cocktails (Brian and Tom were both poached from other top London cocktail establishments). Fine de Claires on-the-half-shell were ordered and brought in a flash. Briny and fresh, I was in heaven. Bread from their boulangerie next door was devoured with French butter (of course). 
I started with the onion soup, which was unctuous and just a little bit sweet. The hubs had a small portion of the beef tartare, which he figures is some of the best he's ever eaten--and he eats it a lot. Another member of the waitstaff recommended a bottle of red from the Jura, her home turf, that was one of the more interesting bottles of wine I've ever had. Slightly effervescent and light in color, it takes a couple of sips to fall in love, but amazing once you get there.
It accompanied the whole chicken for two very well. The chicken itself was roasted to perfection and served with jus, a mix of veg, and velvety potato puree. By this point we were stuffed to the gills, but dessert was needed--for research purposes obviously. I ordered the tart du jour, lemon with a raspberry reduction. Lemon tart is my Achilles heel as of late, and this one was very good. Although, it was more of a lemon mousse with crust, than a lemon tart. Even so, still delicious! My partner in crime had the cheesecake. It was a small portion, but it was so rich, there was no reason for more than they served. He nearly licked the plate clean. 
My only complaint at this point is the timing is a bit off. The coffee came before we had finished our dessert, and after presenting us with the whole chicken, it went back into the kitchen for plating for what seemed like an eternity; I think it was actually more like 15 minutes in human time. But it's their first week, so I imagine things will get smoother with time. 
For those of you who've fallen for the New York Balthazar, you'll recognize the room as an almost exact replica. Other brilliant American aspects include walk-in seating at the bar, the seafood tower, and a true New Yawka working the door. Did I mention the busboys? Oh, and how could I forget? It's reasonably priced; I mean, for Central London anyway.
Yes, as my husband said, it seems like the universe is finally throwing us a bone on the London dining scene. I think a standing weekend reservation may be in order.",1
2,"In a word, the breakfast I had here was incredibly underwhelming, and the other people in my party said the exact same thing.  The service was not bad by any means, but the servers did come off as a little bit scattered.  My waffles were quite dry on their own, and the fact that they gave me no syrup with them really did not help.  One person in my party ordered scrambled eggs, and they were essentially in liquid form.  It was actually quite disgusting, even to look at, let alone eat it.  I know that this place has a good reputation, especially the NYC location, so I was disappointed by the experience.",-1
4,"Everyone was talking about it so I decided to check it out for lunch. I must say I have never been to the NYC one.
The decor is respecting what the americans probably think it is (or was?) a french posh restaurant, a  bit ""ville lumiere"" with a lot of big mirrors and lamps.
the food is good and the service is good and polite. My dad and I had a big steak with french fries, while my mum had an omelette. We were satisfied. 
I kinda like the place, probably will come back since I have heard that the brunch is very good.",1
3,"As far as brunch spots go I'd say this place is a safe bet. The service was good and the food was tasty. The eggs Benedict was good but didn't come with a side so I was left hungry. A half order of the NY pancakes finished me off and rounded out the meal. 
The meal was expensive relative to what you get. That could be a function of the location being next to covent garden square (great place to grab a cup of coffee and listen to the street performers. Exactly what I'm doing as I write this review) or London being expensive...full stop.",-1
4,"As many of my fellow Yelpers have said, it's the perfect Americanized French brasserie brunch spot.  Very NYC in Londontown.  Very good service, very good eggs, very good champagne.  Amazing soufflé, worth it if it's just for that alone!  It was the perfect way to celebrate my birthday before catching the matinee performance of The Book of Mormon.",1
4,"The American influx of Central London eateries continues! My mate had to book weeks in advance to scoop a Friday night reservation and the place was buzzing. Uber prime location with cool interior that lets you pretend you're in NYC (or at least that Sex and the City ep it appears in!). Very much a place to see and be seen with a price tag to match; the food is just 'ok'. Service is top notch though and left me with a smile on my face, even after a disappointingly squishy chocolate soufflé.",1
4,"Setting: This restaurant is big and airy and it really feels like you could be in a mid-20th century French brasserie. The atmosphere is very relaxed and is great for brunch. Even the bathrooms are big and bright. Being in Covent Gardens this is a great location to meet someone from the other side of the city for brunch.
Service: The service was excellent. The staff were attentive, friendly and helpful without ever being overbearing. I really enjoyed this aspect of the experience.
Food: I had my first ever Escargot here and despite my hesitancy over eating snails they were delicious. As brunch goes I wold recommend the Moules Frites. The mussel portions are very generous (I was full before I got to the fries). However the fries are more crunch than substance and a thicker cut (if going off the french fry vibe a little) would make them even better. I definitely want to try the rest of the menu and would come back.",1
2,"It was really just ok....and I cannot understand the hype of this establishment other than the fact it's from New York and therefore that MUST mean we should all love it for the ''New York chicness'' or whatever.......
The decor was very French bistro, the lighting all soft and yellow toned so you felt as though you walked right into an instagram photoshot. I'm sure it would be a very ''chic'' place, there is no other word but chic for this place, to hang out for brunch on Sundays. But I was not impressed with the food selection nor the quality of the seafood. 
The chairs also had no cushions on them so you were sat in this hard wooden chair for the entire evening which makes your bum sore and your skirt sticking to the back of your legs. The tables were tiny and they tried to squeeze as much cutlery, bread plates, bread baskets, glasses and what have you, on this tiny (again hard topped) table. 
There were also A LOT of tables crammed into the whole place, as if the proprietors were trying to simulate a cosy, vintage style, café atmosphere....but actually, to me, did nothing more than to increase the noise levels and made everthing appear very messy.....
Verdict - dislike!",-1
3,"visited Balthazar London after a number of visit at Balthazar New-York - same menu, different currency! food was excellent, as expected, although in London they have quirky hours . Seemed that the pricing was significantly higher than NYC - Why?",-1
3,"Visited this bakery a couple of times now for lunch. They do really tasty sarnies, and normally I'm not a huge sandwich fan. The bread they use is really good and the fillings are quite interesting - I've tried the roast beef and celeriac slaw in a focaccia and the ham and butter baguette - it has hidden tiny gherkins! Yum! They sell salad boxes and lots of different yummy looking cakes (unfortnately haven't sampled any yet).
The bakery has a couple of counter style seats inside but not many. The place is quite pricey for a bakery but I would say worth it if you need a lunch time treat to brighten your day!",-1
4,"I come here for brunch at the weekends or for lunch when I'm not feeling well. Sometimes when I dine alone I receive a complementary glass of sparkling wine, which definitely helps me to feel better. 
The brunch pancakes are superbly well balanced with fruit, syrup, and creme freche. And for lunch my favourite is to have the skate wing, which is cooked just like my Mum used to. Whatever I have I find the flavour combinations to be perfectly balanced. Unfortunately the price is a little higher than I would like so I don't come as often as I want.",1
4,"Came here last night. This is a lovely traditional looking French restaurant with American features. I was bewitched by the interior and by the very good service. They put a rush on for us when we let them know we had a show to get to, but it didn't affect the quality. I had the garlic prawns to start with the most delicious olive bread. The sauce was rich with the aroma of prawn and fish; very moreish! I then moved on to the steak frites but I found the sirloin a bit tough. I had someone else's fillet and that was perfectly seasoned and tender. Don't go for the house sparkling white unless you prefer it less brut. The champagne was much better. We also had a Pinot noir which was excellent. I had a brilliant evening in this vibrant and buzzy restaurant. Truly I can't wait to go back!",1
5,"Been going to the New York one since the the 90s, never had a bad experience, the one in London is a copy of the NY one intern of atmosphere, service quality, and quality of dishes.. Few dishes are different in the menu in London.  Very good wine list reasonably priced.",1
5,"Well get that dialing finger at the ready because you're going to need to book ahead. This isn't a 'let's wander around Covent Garden and see what we find' kind of place, but once you're in, you'll be glad you did. 
The service is very American, which is lovely and refreshing at times, it's nice to be a bit catered to by an army of staff. The decor, like everyone has noted, is a replica of the NY one with loads of French charm. We did a brunch and aside from one of the best bloody marys I've had, the food was pretty epic. An eggs benedict that will not leave you feeling peckish afterwards.. oysters, baked mac & cheese, soufflé... you can easily go overboard with the decadence meter but you'll have to do it sometime, no?
There's a bakery attached where you can take away some of the tempting sweets and fresh breads. It's a must stop for anyone that loves eating, you'll agonize over what to order and end up getting the entire menu like we did. It's not totally overpriced either, for what you get it's actually quite reasonable.",1
5,Wow. What lovely bread. The new salad of beets and carrots with burnt orange dressing  is just out if this world. The steak au poivre was just perfect and the service top notch.  I'm coming back.,1
2,"Sadly this was a let down and isn't a patch on the NYC one. I suspect the location in London is one of the issues as it ends up being full of tourists and almost feels like an Angus Steak House!
Our waiter knew diddly about the menu and when i asked for a standard drink - fresh lime and soda, he got a proper sweat on and then told me they didn't stock that cocktail?! 
The actual brunch was so so but nothing special.",-1
4,"Yum! Had read negative professional reviews in the papers and was hesitant to try it, but so glad I took the plunge.
Pros: Lovely ambiance (similar to Delaunay), excellent front of house staff, excellent waitstaff. Asked to have table changed during a busy lunch hour as wanted more privacy for a lunch meeting and was accommodated immediately and gracefully. 
Plats du jour are an excellent deal. Food is consistent, menu is varied, pricing very reasonable for quality of food. Balthazar house salad had just the perfect touch of truffle oil and seasonal ingredients. Mains are superb. Even the bread basket offers a step up from the standard dry baguette that one finds elsewhere. And the takeaway bakery next door is charming.
Cons: Forced to come up with something, simply that there can be a bit of wait it seems others have discovered this gem as well!",1
3,"Done the NY one. Enjoyed the buzz. So when it opened here in London we thought we should give it a try.
But getting in at a reasonable time is a different matter. All booked up.
Just so happens we had tickets for Charlie and the chocolate factory at Drury Lane on Thursday. 7.30 kick off. Balthazar right outside. Why not try a pre-theatre raid.
A 6pm table of 3 was duly booked. We got there on time and the place was already busy. The bar was full and three quarters of the tales were taken. Bags were swiftly taken and we were at our table.
Balthazar London feels exactly the same as New York. Loud. Thronging. hot. Nicely decked out in authentic French brasserie tiling and furniture. Serving staff whizz round all over the gaff and there is a big seafood bar at the back to whet the appetite. This is proper tourist London stuff, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Slap bang in the middle of covent garden and full of hip things out for a good time. It feels great.
The menu is what you'd expect from a good French brasserie. Nice bread arrived to munch on, plenty of it. Followed by a good moules et frites which was lifted by the inclusion of caramelised fennel. The boy had macaroni cheese sans the bacon and the missus had a skirt steak that was full of taste. 
My chip were a little soggy was my only complaint on the food. But it was pretty expensive for what we got I thought.
However, you're paying for the great atmosphere, not the food. And for a bit of a treat if you're painting good old London Town red, it's definitely got it. Go there and show out. It's fun. Not perfect food and a bit pricey but great fun nonetheless. Not quite a 4 but a high 3 stars well earned.
Nb If I did theatre reviews I Would give Charlie and the chocolate factory 6 stars. It was truly brilliant. And I hate the theatre.  Book it. And try Balthazar before for a proper night out!
The place was heaving by the time we left at 7. So do book.",-1
5,"Popped into the small takeaway section next door to the main restaurant, greeted promptly by the very friendly staff, purchased a selection of fresh bread (you can ask for half a loaf if you require) this time I got a spelt, white and an olive ciabatta. The olive ciabatta is one if the tastiest I've ever had, loads of flavour and full of olives! 
Good selection of fresh sandwiches and small cakes to tempt you.
Located very close to the piazza.",1
4,Well priced for what you get. Superbly cooked sharing steaks and sparkling service from our supremely rude (in a naughty way!) French waiter who's grasp of innuendo was second to none. Desserts were also pretty good and was overjoyed that they resisted the urge to put a f***ing raspberry or dome such in the bottom of their creme brûlée (a pet hate of mine and all too common these days),1
5,"Thank you for our lovely meal, pre and post opera. Food delicious, service excellent. Staff very knowledgeable and kind. Thank you.",1
4,"A Near exact replica of the famous SoHo location in NYC, i have to love this spot as it reminds me of home. With classics like moules frites, steak tar tar, the seafood platter and excellent bloody marys, this is the perfect brunch spot for any event.",1
4,"The bar is very impressive.  This is the sort of place the word über was invented for.  The wine list is great, the bar menu is great, it isn't cheap and doesn't feel it.  I was only here for drinks and snacks.  If you're in Covent Garden and haven't decided on where to go this wouldn't be a bad place to start.",1
4,"Impressive dining room,  nice for a special treat. I've been for breakfast twice now and had the avocado on toast with poached egg. Lovely. They have a private dining room now for larger groups.",1
2,"On a recent trip, went to Balthazar with a friend who had great food at Balthazar in the past. Possibly this was the one-off day but the food was very average. We both essentially got a steak and it wasn't great. The wine though was brilliant - we got recommendation from the sommelier and it was a great suggestion. Will visit again though since it possibly was just a busy Friday eve.",-1
4,"Spent an enjoyable afternoon over a classy bottle of beautiful tasting wine and a bowl of mussels and fries cooked to perfection, what more do you want in life. The ambience is great, the staff are attentive and understand how to look after the customers. Great place, priced accordingly but worth it.",1
4,"I had to wait for my friend so I spent about 45 minutes in the bar area. I love the bar! Great selection of wines and friendly bartenders. Food was excellent. I had the beetroot dish for a starter, the salmon with spinach and lentils for my main, and chocolate for dessert. Service was excellent. I actually felt like I was in New York in this restaurant, they've definitely captured the NYC buzz.",1
3,"Went here last night with 3 friends, good atmosphere although very noisy (we were in a nice semi-circular booth but I could hardly hear my friend across from me). Started with a cocktail, nice but at £10.50 a little steep for a small glass with a lot of ice. Food was tasty, I had fish pie which was rich but delicious, packed with fish, then the lemon posset for dessert, which was fine but nothing special.  Overall I came away with a bill for £50 (including a glass of wine) and felt that for the quality of the meal (and the wine), although good, it was a little overpriced. I had been expecting more because of the hype. Service was excellent. I probably wouldn't go again, too many amazing choices in London!",-1
4,"Ambiance: perfect, busy, cute French bistro restaurant!
Service: friendly, helpful, and a little slow. ( which you should expect from the French, they like to take their time)
Food: perfect menu. Lobster, cooked perfectly, oysters, nice selection shucked just right, French onion was ok, nothing to ride hoe about. 
Reason for a 4: Balthazar in NY is better. They have a better selection of seafood. In NY, you can order jumbo prawns that are a true jumbo.  Also the baked bread in NY is fresher.  I still enjoyed the London restaurant and would highly recommend it.",1
4,"Nice ambiance, great service, but definitely overpriced. Ordered the spaghetti with lobster--expected the meal to be a lot tastier. Overall, a good experience; I'd go back to try something new.",1
4,"Great bakery (haven't tried the restaurant). One of my fav stops in Covent Garden. Try the delicious spinach and mushroom croissant. Lovely presentation too.
Super friendly staff and classic European (French) look. The classical music soundtrack is a bit old-fashioned but frankly better than some of the pretentious affect-pop one might hear in the more hipster coffee shops.
A place that makes one feel good. If prices were a little lower, I'd give 5 stars (but they're within the norm).",1
4,"A ""New York"" brunch never quite had the perfect venue in London. There were a number of places that came close: Breakfast Club, Automat, Tom's Kitchen all came close in my books... but none ever truly captured the essence and food (read: pancakes) of those Saturday and Sunday mornings that I used to spend in Manhattan. Balthazar, which looks and feels identical to her sibling across the Atlantic, fits this niche perfectly. The food is well executed (the Huevos Rancheros were delicious during my visit this weekend), the staff attentive, the room well decorated, the sound level loud without being deafening. Balthazar is a place I could see myself returning to for dinner, for a drink... and certainly for another weekend brunch with friends.",1
4,"Came here for breakfast. Familiar with Balthazar from New York and was eager to try a traditional full English breakfast. it was yummy and didn't disappoint. My husband got some selection of pastries and jams. Carb overload but he enjoyed it. Overall, it was as expected: good food, a little pricey, and a little crowded. Not sure if I would even consider returning here for dinner as it seems to get booked up and there are tons of amazing places to have dinner in London (*cough cough Great Queen Street *cough cough*).",1
2,"We booked Balthazar for a pre-theatre supper on my birthday. First impressions were great as we arrived early to have drinks at the busy bar. It had a buzzy atmosphere at 5pm and we ordered drinks whilst we waited for our table. I had an Aperol spritz which was watery and rather expensive for 9.50 but we perused the menu which sounded good and got shown to a nice corner table. This is where it all started to unravel. The wine list is ludicrously expensive and we ordered two half bottles as the house wines did not appeal. I ordered saffron risotto to start which had 1.1/2 (!) scallops on the top. It arrived with a skin on it so had either been sat waiting to be served or had been microwaved to high heaven. My boyfriend's game pate was not pate, more like a thick over seasoned terrine. Bread was a little stale and butter ice cold. My main was 1/2 a lobster which arrived served on a bed of ice with no fork or cracker to open it. Every time I tried to get some flesh out it was submerged in a slushy, icy bath and it felt like I got an 1/8 of a lobster! Pretty revolting and served with what appeared to be Heinz seafood sauce. My boyfriend's duck shepherd's pie was greasy, small and swimming in fat. All in all the bill came to £160 which we certainly anticipated, but for this price range you would expect high quality French food. We will not be returning, considering brasserie Zedel is not too far away and has a far more spectacular ambience for half the price I cannot believe Balthazar gets away with the terrible expensive food it has to offer. Please save your money and go elsewhere! London has so much more to offer than this overpriced mediocrity!",-1
4,"Very attentive staff made our first visit to Balthazar easily enjoyable. We didn't have a reservation but were promptly seated. Girlfriend had the eggs royale, I had the eggs hussard both of which were absolutely delicious. 
Afterwards we shared the waffles which were a bit dry and didn't come with enough berry sauce to make a difference. Staff very helpful again though and brought a generous serving of chocolate sauce on the side. 
Menu a bit boring but exactly what you would expect from a bistro brunch. 
Great service. Most food excellent. 
Highly recommended.",1
5,Simple set menu with everything cooked perfectly! Sometimes it's nice to have very few options. This place does one thing very well. Steak and frites!,1
4,"This was one of the first meals that I had in London and it was really good. This restaurant is known for two things, steak and fries. The restaurant loves serving this so much that it is actually the only two things they have on the whole menu.  The steak was cooked perfectly. Also just when you think you are done they bring you out more steak and fries so that you can have even more.  
The waiters and waitresses are just nice but not the friendliest of people I have ever met.  The food was really good, but the place inside was not the largest.  
The best part about this place is the simplicity of it and the fact that you know your going to get good steak and good fries when you come here.  I would highly recommend to people looking for steak and fries in London to try this place out!",1
5,"This is probably one of my favorite places in London. The atmosphere is very good inside, always crowded so may be you will need to wait outside to wait for your table! But trust me it worth it. There is no menu only one menu salad, meat and chips thats it. But everything is cooked with heart and Quality always same. Enjoy it!!!",1
5,"Just amazing. The most delicious restaurant for steak and fries in London. I've been to the one in Paris, and the one in New York City and they are all spectacular. This one does not disappoint. And if you see a line out front don't worry it moves quickly.",1
4,"A great dinner here with two close friends.  Atmosphere and pace is frenetic, but the close tables and loud conversation levels leads to a very communal experience.
The steak Porte Maillot with ""special sauce"" was executed perfectly...especially since it is the only main dish on the menu!  You simply chose the ""doneness"" of the meat.  By American standards, we ordered the ""medium"" version and it came out medium-rare (my actual preference)...just know this to help determine your desired meat temp.
The salad was simple and elegant, three total ingredients and that mustard-based dressing was certainly unusual but quite tasty!
We shared a bottle of their house (red) wine and I had a nice dessert with ice cream and bitter chocolate ""balls"" (les profiteroles au chocolat).
A fantastic meal in a lively setting, what more could you want?",1
5,"Delicious food, friendly customer service...I love the  sauce it is definitely special and hard to find any where else. I can't wait to go back here in my next visit to London.",1
2,"Mmmm this place takes the cake in how to create a hype, not much to write home about.. Dresserts aren't bad though",-1
5,"We went for lunch and loved it.  It's a fixed menu that includes a green salad, thinly sliced steak, and French fries.  When you think you're done, you aren't because they will bring your second serving of meat.  The quality of the food was excellent and the atmosphere very nice too, although tables are very close together.",1
5,A little bit of Paris in London. The authentic Entrecôte right in the heart of Marleybone. From the service to the atmosphere to the food it's exactly like the original in Paris. Well done! This will be a regular stop on my London trips,1
4,"When there's one item on the menu, you better believe they get that right. Your only choice is ""How would you like that cooked?"". I picked medium rare, but the waitress informed me that this is cooked in the French style and medium would equal my idea of a medium rare.
A salad was delivered first, which was greatly appreciated! The salad was a really nice, light touch to what would be a heavy hearty meal. Then the steak arrived with french fries, both which melted in your mouth.
For dessert, we ordered the tower of ice cream and meringue (i forgot what it was called) and the profiteroles. The latter was my favorite of the two.",1
5,"Excellent steak. Love the ""Secret Sauce"" great service. Opens at 1800. Be there early or stand in line.",1
4,"Excellent food. Perfect salade, perfect steak, sauce and fries. 4 stars and not 5 because you can't book and the queue can be horrendous.",1
4,"Melt in your mouth steak L'entricote with that classic sauce they do. I don't know what exactly is in it, but always ask for an extra pot on the side it's so damn good. 
Just when you think you've devoured it all, they come back with a full second portion of all this too. Ohhh seconds?? Yes please.
All this is after you enjoy a wardorf salad as part of your main, which is fab too.
This place has a few restaurants around town as well as NYC and Paris were it originated from. With one thing on the menu, sit back, order a glass of red wine and wait for the sensory delights to arrive (twice). It's consistently good whichever branch I've been at (note- I once went Canary Wharf and they had 50% off at weekends).",1
5,"""WOOHOO! AS GOOD AS IT GETS"" definitely describes this place. A friend first brought me here on a cold day where we ended up waiting 20 minutes for a table. But I came back the following week with friends, and then again with my family, until we figured out it was best to come before it opens to be the first wave of customers in. And then it became a regular thing with anyone visiting, ever. Or any catch up, or any birthday celebrations - yes - we're going to Le Relais de Venise L'Entrecote for dinner.
The experience starts with a mouth watering walnut salad with this yummy sauce, but the unspeakably good star of the show is the sauce that comes with the steak. Let me rewind a bit and say that steak and fries is all you're gonna get. You tell the waitress how you like it (blue, rare, medium or well done - there is no in-betweens), she writes it on the table and off she goes. When it comes out - you are presented with a plate of delicious steak and fries to mop up all the excess sauce you manage not to cram in on every single bite. 
I was so shocked the first time I came here because, as normal, I finished my meal in record time still lusting for more. AND MORE THERE WAS. The waitress comes back with the SECOND HALF (?!?!) of your meal, the steak that was still in the kitchen so that it won't go cold, and an extra helping of fries. Lord have mercy.
And once you think you can't go on, you have a look around and get massive food envy as all these delicious looking desserts start piling out. Now, I don't speak french so you're just gonna have to figure this one out on the menu yourself but the MUST orders are the profiteroles (which I usually don't like, but these are filled with vanilla ice cream instead of cream and are DELICIOUS!) and this stack of ice cream, meringue, praline, amazingness.
This place is definitely a 10/10 in my books!",1
2,"I don't understand what the whole fuss is about: we waited in the queue outside (or in American term: we waited in the line!) Then we were served two small portions of steak with a special sauce but frankly speaking I had much better steaks but the fries was great. The waitress was super serious and when we asked to have our photo taken, she commented that if it is quick! I know it is hectic but a photo at most takes 10 seconds! Anyway, I don't think I will go back here.",-1
3,"I was told rare is bleeding but what I really got was medium rare, no blood, and the famous sauce that was really just supplementary rather then complimentary to the very mediocrely cooked meat...",-1
5,"This place had only our reserved table free when we arrived, it was packed and I understood why after we ate! The menu is set and in my opinion, perfect. They start you off asking how you like your meat and then bring you a little tasty salad with a mustard vinaigrette. Shortly after you finish your salad they bring you a plate with a semi small amount of steak in peppercorn sauce and fries. Don't worry about the size! They come around after you've eaten your way through it with plate refills of fries AND steak! I was full from my first plate (looks can be deceiving with size! Eyes bigger than stomach!) I can say without any doubt this is the best steak I've ever eaten. It was cooked perfectly and the meat was flawless, zero gristle to trim and full of flavor. I had a delightful Peruvian beer with dinner and creme brûlée for dessert - my man had a small bottle of red wine. The waitress was friendly and checked in with us a few times. I dream of this meal!",1
4,"Intimate and vibrant french restaurant that serves up only one dish, which is steak and frites. The cut is ""La Entrecôte"" which is the cut from the ribs.
You only need to make two choices:
1. What to drink?
2. How you like your meat prepared; rare, medium or well
After that it is cruise control. The meal starts with salad dressed with a mustard dressing and bread. Next comes the delicious steak and frites. The surprise is the second serving of both steak and frites. That put a smile on my face.",1
5,"Yes, it hit the spot!  Simple and Delicious steak and frites! That sauce is A+
Highlights:  Steak cooked to perfection with generous portions of frites...plus SECONDS! Reasonably priced, Good and fast service all inside a nice, clean and big dinning area.  Also, desserts are awesome.  
Can improve:  Take reservations and Give Ketchup or Tomato Sauce.
Benchmark:  I am not a big steak & frites guy and even I found it irresistible.  They set the steak & frites benchmark in my book.
Word of advice:  They don't take reservations so go early when they open for dinner around 7 pm and you should have no problem getting a table.
Dined in April 2016 and will definitely return.",1
5,"We arrived when they opened and got right in.  The service was excellent and the food was delicious.  I loved that I didn't have to decide what to eat, just told them how I like my meat cooked and they take it from there. The salad was fresh and delicious, they provided bread which was crispy on the outside and soft inside.  The steak was perfectly sliced and done to my liking. The sauce was amazing, and the fries were perfectly cooked.  They even offer you a second helping if you want. For desert we tried the Le Vacherin du Relais, it was layers of meringue and ice cream topped with hot chocolate and whip cream - it was incredible. I wish they had a location in Los Angeles where I live.",1
5,"Great restaurant experience here. Excellent service, perfectly cooked steak and delish crispy French fries. We had the house red wine which was also very good. They have a location in New York too that I want to try :)",1
4,"Le Relais de venise only does one thing, but it does it well: steak frittes. On being seated, the server will ask how you want your steak cooked - if you're vegetarian and/or have a nut allergy, this is your opportunity to shout. The green salad brought to you before your main has walnuts on top, but if you ask for them to be left off, it's not a problem. What may be a bigger problem is that the chips are cooked in groundnut oil - if you have a peanut allergy, you will starve.
I believe vegetarians can substitute their steak for a lot of cheese, but it's an expensive option. £24 for steak frittes or £24 for fromage frittes with a dessert. If you're a veggie, I just wouldn't bother.
The steak is brought to you in two parts, which effectively works out as two giant plates of cow and chips, so it's a big undertaking. My advice is to skip lunch because if you can't finish the main, you will be disappointed with yourself.
The desserts are around the £5/£6 mark and are nice (the crème brûlée is a reliable offering) however you will probably be too full to manage one. House wine (around £5 a glass, £10 for a carafe, £20 for a bottle) is drinkable enough.
You can't book a table even if you're a group, so eat early (5.30pm) or expect to queue out the door. Although tables are a little close, that's because there are a lot of people who want to get in and don't mind sitting on their neighbours.
All in all, this isn't a cheap meal, but it's a substantial one, cooked well.",1
3,"This is my second time here for dinner. I won't say the food isn't good but what I can say is the service is really a DISASTER! 
One girl who served at our table always put on a shit face and was very rude. We had four people here and she was keeping pushing the table to my friends side which made them really uncomfortable, and she didn't say anything about that. Apart from that, my friends went shopping afternoon so they had some big bags, in case that those would block the aisle, they saved their belongings temporarily at the cloakroom. When we about to leave and asked staff to get the stuff back, one girl just stared at us with very disgusting face and chose to ignore us.
So, if you want to experience this kind of world standard shit service, please come here, I bet you've got little temper to lose here.",-1
5,"YES! FINALLY A RESTAURANT THAT COOKS MY STEAK THE WAY I LIKE IT! 
(sorry for the all-caps intro, but I'm just so happy!!)
So, anyone who, like me, likes their steak rather under than over and is getting tired of the whole 'the least we can cook it is medium rare' bullsh*t, head to Le Relais de Venise. 
But with the food being so good and the whole thing being VERY good value for money, you'll most probably have to queue. Though chances are I'll be in the queue too, so maybe we can have a little chat then?",1
4,It's one of those London things.. although not exclusively. Sauce is delicious. Meat is good quality. Salad is yummy too! No nonsense place for a fun casual meal.,1
4,"My first Le Relais experience was in Paris where I accidentally walked into that restaurant. And I enjoyed that experience. When I learned that there was another version in London, I had to make sure I had to bookmark it on my trip here.
Walking in the London version, it even feels like you're in Paris. The tables are very cramped and that you are literally right next to another stranger only inches away. So you need to pull out the table to move around.
And just like the Paris versions, there are no menus. Just steak and frites with a small salad in the beginning. But it's the sauce that makes this place standout compared to other steak joints. It has a nice, tangy vinaigrette flavor that only this restaurant can provide. The steaks by themselves are just normal steaks, served in only ""Rare"" or ""Medium."" Even ""medium rare"" is not allowed. Again, just rare or medium here in London.
And just like the Paris version, you get your second serving shortly after you finished your first plate. 
And as for the dessert, you may need one of the French waitresses to help you out since the menu is in French. But I went with the Profiteroles au chocolat. Nice warm chocolate smothering some vanilla ice cream with shaved walnuts. Now that is a great way to finish the meal.",1
4,"The steak was excellent. I loved it. The fries were excellent--very crisp without being dry and not too fat. The sauce was probably the best part about it, however. I feel like I've gotten comparable steak and fries elsewhere, but the sauce really brought the whole dish together. It really makes you wanna go back for more and more! I will say, however, that I've had better steak elsewhere. I may have a skewed view, though, because I had a really intense conversation with relatives while eating there and was somewhat distracted. Overall, though, this place was amazing! I'd totally come here again if I am in the neighborhood.",1
5,"Excellent, faultless meal.
The service was attentive and efficient, but most importantly -- savvy. We all know they're trying to get customers through quickly (this place must make a FORTUNE!); however, I never felt even a little rushed. Everything was perfectly timed to allow us to enjoy a relaxed meal.
The house Bordeaux is super drinkable, not overly tannic, and well-balanced (even if slightly lacking in depth), with a seemingly minimal price markup for a bottle. 
What you get is what you come for. Delicious steak and fries. It's an excellent and simple meal perfectly executed. What more does one need to say? 
Show up early if you don't want to wait, otherwise, expect to wait!",1
3,"I was meeting a girlfriend for lunch and she wanted to go to Le Relais de Venise.  I was excited because it's in my neighbourhood and I've been wanting to check it out because I've heard great things about it.
Food: There's no menu.  They only serve steak frites and as much as you want of it.  They will ask how you would like your meat cooked.  They then start off with a simple salad, the steak comes in small slices, frites and a wonderful sauce that makes you want more.  Very simple.
Drinks: We ordered one sprite and tap water.
Price: 56.10 GBP for two people.
Ambiance: The restaurant feels like a true bistro in Paris.  It was very crowded and bustling for lunch.  It's first come, first serve and they will not seat your party until everyone is there.  
Service: This is why I gave three stars.  Here's where everything went wrong.  The service was horrible.  Our server was a woman who seemed like she hated her job.  She didn't have the time of day for us.  She was very unfriendly, curt, rude and kept bumping into my girlfriend's chair without even saying I'm sorry.  There was a table next to us that was empty and when they were about to seat two people she looked at the diners, said ""oh sh*t"" and then slammed down the cutlery and glasses onto the table.  The icing on the cake was when she was serving me the frites and dropped one in to my water glass.  She didn't apologise or even come back to replace my water.  I waited for 10 minutes, asked for a new glass of water only to find her very annoyed.
Would I go back?  Maybe.  I wouldn't rush back and if I did go back I would definitely not sit in the section of that server if she's still there.",-1
5,"Love this place. No choices, just a question of how you want your steak cooked. Amazing salad; a few wine choices. This is the epitome of do one thing and do it well.",1
4,"One of the best restaurants in the chain compared to other locations. Always good prompt service and the food is great. You know it's good when there is such a line outside waiting to get in, so it may be better to turn up a little bit earlier than you want to eat, just in case.",1
3,The steak was good but not as good as some of the other locations. The restaurant was crowded and the service staff did not care much. We went quite early so even though they don't take reservations we were able to get a table fast.,-1
5,"They only have one entree on the menu and that is steak. When you get there, you are asked, how do you want your steak. So the only other decision you have to make it is what to drink and what dessert to order. 
They serve a good, fresh and healthy salad. Then comes the most sumptuous steak ever. Melt in your mouth, flavourful steak, with chips (fries). When you are done, they bring you a second serving of steak and chips.
Amazing food, fast efficient service, and very affordable. One of my favourite spots in London, as well as in Geneva. 
Be prepared to wait in line as they don't accept reservations. I have stood in line on weekdays as well.",1
3,It's a good dinner but just prepare to wait in the long line around the corner. It's all you can eat so you do get some bang for your buck. I do think there are better places  to get steak. The meat wasn't particularly good and the tight tables are a bit claustrophobic.,-1
5,"I hate decisions.
So, you can see...that means I quite love Le Relais de Venise L'Entrecote (especially when a colleague selects it, and the time) -- even though I can scarcely remember the ordering of its name. 
I assure you though, once you've been -- you'll never forget! 
To do but one thing so well, is sometimes as magical as the green sauce the steak and chips come drizzled in. What LRdVLE lacks in choice, it makes up for 10-fold in quality. 
You'll get this, my pretties: 
1. Steak. (the ONE option is -- ""how would you like this cooked?"")
2. Salad. 
3. Chips. 
4. Greeeeeeeeeen sauce. 
In perpetuity. Served by lovely French people in trim black and white uniforms. 
Quite fabulous for a business lunch (though it does fill up quickly) -- as you'll not be waiting around for everyone to make decisions and can be back to your office swiftly. The guesswork has been removed. You'll be having steak. And salad. And chips. And that green sauce everyone moans about for days and days... 
And if you're like me, you'll be thrilled. Yum. So French and so disciplined. 
*no reservations. 
*great deals at their Canary Wharf location, ask the servers.",1
4,"There is only one thing on the menu, apparently that's a bit of a trend around London right now (see Burger & Lobster). Delicious steak and frites, which also comes with a starter salad. The steak sauce is super buttery so prepare for a post meal coma. Also neat how they serve your main in two portions so the second half stays hot, thoughtful!",1
5,"Bloody Hell (for lack of a better commonwealth expression, I apologize), this place is fabulous!
I arrived at 6pm (when they open for dinner) sharp after attending the theater, and the line was already one block long!  We were the last group to be seated snagging the final open table, and we had a minimal wait of 10 minutes.  If I had to wait 45 minutes, I would have done it gladly.
Intriguing fact number 1: There was no menu. I was so confused. My date (sister in law) was getting the giggles off the bat watching me trying to piece together this culinary puzzle. A lady came to take our order, simply asking how we liked our meat. Strange, what if I wanted fish....? I said rare, and then she took a marker to my side of the table with a large ""R"" (clearly it is paper table cloths!) 
Intriguing fact number 2: Then they brought out a salad. I didn't ask for a salad, but I certainly didn't send it back!  Butter leaf lettuce with walnuts and a mustard vinegrette. It was so simple and yum! 
Then the waitress came to the table and served me beautifully butterflied steak strips with a green sauces and hot chips.  The chips were long, skinny and crunchy!  And the meat, well, it was one of the best meals I've ever had. The meat is imported from Scotland, and it is in a league of it's own!!!  Intriguing fact number 3: I got my entree, twice! Oh yes, what is better than one delicious meal? Having two helpings of it! SO don't worry when you polish off your plate.... more is coming!!!
Head out there (early) so that you can roll out of there like I did, content and happy as a clam. I wish we had one of these in Nor cal because I would be there all the time!!!",1
5,"You ever meet those people that are really, REALLY good at one thing? Like, you have that roommate you went to school with who knows trivia from ""The Matrix"" movies better than anyone, or there was that girl you crushed on who could mop the floor with anyone on Wednesday nights when the local pub is having trivia for the week and the theme is H.P. Lovecraft and you're both impressed and terrified? This place is like your friend, only they are incredibly good at serving steak and fries. Oh, and being awesomely personable. And being able to tolerate a table of out-of-towners (from Texas, to boot) with the patience and sass of someone who can easily blend patience and sass while also convincing me to have not one but two scotches after a bottle of wine. Yes, this place and the staff are that good.
We arrived around 8:00 on a Friday night per the recommendations of the locals. The place is a small restaurant with a line wrapping around the corner and extending back into a corner of an alley where you can look up at the guy living in the apartment across from the place who methodically paces while on the phone and organizes his shoe collection (sorry guy who lives across the place - but your shoe collection is boss). There's a reason people are willing to wait 45+ minutes in the cold and rain for this place. And if you're still reading this review, you're about to find out why.
We probably waited around 25 minutes, but we got lucky. A professional and polite hostess greeted us at the door when our turn in line had come and we were walked to a table in a crowded dining room. Let there be no doubt: L'Entrecote has figured out how to maximize their space and the maximum occupancy here is probably 6,000 despite being the size of my hotel's lobby. You'll be making new friends at your table, such as the traveling couple next to us who were absolutely sweet, so if you're shy, you may need to get over that real quick.
Our waitress came over and took our order and immediately panic sunk in. No ""medium rare"" steak?! Send me back to Texas where our beef is still moo-ing when you cut into it! Turns out there was nothing to fear as the ""medium"" steak was heavenly. My advice would be to placate the salad beforehand and save room for the main course. Don't get me wrong - the salad may rock your socks off but the steak and fries will also send your socks to the cleaners and bring them back with a complimentary breath mint. 
The whole place operates on a ""steak and fries are our entrees"" menu, and there's a reason: the sauce. If you've tasted their sauce and found it anything less than a miracle on your plate, please book a trip to the local funeral parlor because you clearly were born without a soul. I went back for seconds, another in our party went back for thirds. Add all this up on our bottle of red wine and you have a meal fit for anyone who plans on eating themselves into a coma. This doesn't even take dessert into consideration, with the absolute best profiteroles I have ever had. Bonus tip for those of you still reading: get a round of scotch (or two, in my case) with the profiteroles. Not only will the sweetest bartender in the world deliver them, but you will find out that this is a combo no one can beat without some serious effort.
Speaking of the sweet staff, everyone working here is an undercover angel. I'm convinced of it. I never call out staff in my reviews but our server, Asia, was phenomenal. She not only put up with our relentless questions and my request for scotch after wine and port, but she did it with a level of quick wit that immediately endeared her with all of us. The team here helps each other out, with one girl removing empty glasses deftly and naturally, the bartender delivering scotch with a divine smile, and the food runners polished and focused on their destination. Make no mistake, the reason this place operates as efficiently as it does is because of the immaculate workers under the roof.
Sure, you can knock on them for wanting to turn a table quickly to get the line out the door moving, and you can complain about the limited menu. Doing either of those is providing a grave disservice to this establishment, a hearty dining option filled with delicious food, professional staff and a diverse enough dessert menu to ensure you need to come back. And if this is your first time eating here, I genuinely envy you and what you are about to experience.",1
4,"After a little confusion about whether this was an all you can eat place (it isn't), a group of 8 of us headed here for dinner while in London. After looking on Yelp I was really worried about just how long we'd have to queue for but thankfully on a Thursday if you arrive around 6 - 6.30, you won't have to wait at all. Score!
We were seated at a large table and they quickly took our orders - I mean, super quickly. The only thing available is the steak and chips (with a salad to start) and they simply ask how you want it done. Options are blue, rare, medium and well done. I went for rare as I figured this being their speciality it was better to go for less cooked than over cooked. 
I didn't particularly enjoy the salad starter, to be it was just a normal kind of salad with dressing. There was also bread on the side which again, didn't win me over as it was just a standard kind of baguette. When the steak arrived though, I was in heaven. Lovely and pink with a delicious gravy kind of sauce and a good portion of chips. I quite like that they served your meat in two goes although I'm sure the second portion that was served to me was my workmates order of blue steak as it was a hell of a lot more bloody than my first portion (that being said, I still ate it). 
Service here is weird - they are all aloof and abrupt. I didn't realise we were still in those days of service, I thought that died along with Gordon Ramsay's popularity in the early 2000s. Stuffy, unfriendly service is never going to win me over no matter how good the food is. If the staff were a bit more upbeat and accommodating this place would have been upgraded to 5 stars for sure.",1
4,"If there is a crowd waiting outside, do not fret! The service is extremely quick. 
If you like steak and frites, come here (because this is all they offer).  The salad has a simple mustard dressing.  The steak is covered in a green sauce that is amazing. The frites are fried to perfection. :)",1
1,"I visited the restaurant last night with a group of people 
I've been a huge fan of L' entrecôte for many years, I hadn't been since 6-7 years 
Service was poor, the waitress didn't speak or understand much English, the fries were cold and soggy, the meat was cold. We complained & returned the plates. Second time around they were a little better but nothing like 6-7 years ago. It was not worth the 45 min wait outside & I will never go back. So sad I always dined at the L' entrecôte  here and in Paris every time I visited. 
They have become negligent because of their popularity",-1
2,Worst service have seen in years. Abysmal. Food swimming in dressing. Major disappointment,-1
2,"I was pretty excited to come here because of all the great reviews but it was just ok. There was a huge line and it was crowded but I don't understand why.
 The menu is just steak and fries with no variations at all. My husband didn't like it at all because the steak just tastes like the sauce, and he is a fan of the true taste of the steak itself which a good chef can bring out. He also didn't like the sauce that much. I like sauce more than he does so I didn't think it was so bad, but it still wasn't anywhere near as great as these reviews make it out to be. It was just a steak that was slathered in an okay sauce and as long as you like that sauce you'll be fine, because that is what everything tastes like.  Not bad but nothing special.",-1
5,"The moment we walked into the space we knew it was going to be a great experience. Delicious food, nice atmosphere.  Loved it.",1
4,"Respect for a place that can make it their business to serve just one entree. There's no ""choose from the menu"" situation. You're served a plate of salad, a plate of steak and fries, and then another plate of steak and fries.
Steak is a food people are pretty picky about and this places manages to sell only steak and also do it successfully. You can get your cut done any degree of rare-ness and it is properly executed.
The merengue tower dessert is also quite good.
I realize it doesn't sound as classy but it might be more pronounceable (and also straightforward) to call this place Steak, Steak, Frites.
Having visited in Paris as well I can say these people have their stuff done!",1
3,"Came for dinner with a friend - plan was to eat around 8:30 PM on a Wednesday, but the line was insane, so we went to the pub around the corner, had a pint, came back and the line was gone. We were seated promptly and put in our orders. I was a little hesitant to go to this place as I like my steak a certain way (blue - as in, almost still alive) and it almost always disappoints in the UK (because a steak ordered blue in Britain often comes out as medium rare or even medium - ick! And British people get twitchy if you send food back in restaurants, so it really is rolling the dice). But my friend really wanted steak and this seemed like a good option in the neighborhood.
As others have noted, there are no menu choices - only desired level of doneness for steak. I ordered mine blue. We also got the house Bordeaux, which paired nicely with the food. When the steak came out, it actually was blue! Success! But the plate was so ripping hot that it was starting to convert the beautiful bloody meat to a grey overcooked mess, so I had to be uncouth and evacuate it to the bread plate. The server gave me a ""wtf"" look and I tried to explain, but she didn't speak English, so they probably just thought I was a weirdo, but whatever. That's better than ending up with overcooked steak.
Overall, it was a reasonably good dinner, but for £24, I could make myself better steak frites. Nice atmosphere, though. I'd say it's worth it if you want a simple, pretty good meal, but it's definitely not worth waiting more than a few minutes. If the line is long, probably better to find someplace else.",-1
5,"This is my favourite restaurant - though the original in Paris trumps this one, bien sur. The food is the same, just as amazing, but the atmosphere is not quite the same as in Paris. They probably treat you a bit nicer here, and ain't nobody got time for that. From the baguette to the walnut salad (the vinaigrette is divine) to the steak-frites with the extraordinary secret sauce, accompanied by the house white or a flute or two of champagne - leave me the hell alone because I'm officially in heaven. 
No seriously, piss off. Ommmmmm...",1
5,"Le Relais de Venise is the centre of the steak world. There is nothing to decide here, no options, you can either order the steak frites or you will be asked to leave. Seriously, the surly waitresses will throw you out if you don't order the steak frites. You can however, select if you would like your steak cooked blue, rare, or medium.
So does Le Relais de Venise live up to the hype? Most definitely. I'm still dreaming about the secret ""green sauce.""   At 21 quid for a walnut salad, some bread and 2 servings of steak frites you can't go wrong. That's right, course 1: salad. course 2: steak frites. course 3: steak frites. So worth a visit.",1
5,"This place was awesome from the start. A delicious salad followed by steak cooked to perfection, in a crazy good sauce, served with fries/chips. How could it get better? Seconds!!! :)",1
4,"My husband and I had dinner here with 2 friends on Monday night. The food was fantastic, I love the simple but perfectly cooked menu - and very reasonably priced. Service was prompt and friendly. I thought the house red wine wasn't great (having eaten at the same restaurant previously I remember it being better the first time).
Will definitely go back!",1
5,"I start this review with a question. Is there a chance for a single option menu to represent a fantastic option for a restaurant? Le Relais de Venise L'Entrecôte proves anyone that this is indeed possible, besides the first impressions. You are probably going to be waiting in a queue in the cold for a good while, but I can guarantee it is going to be worth every second. 
Steak and fries (as much as you want for the later, obviously not for the earlier) with a wonderful sauce that is their big secret. No one knows what the recipe is, but I assure you are going to be willing for more after you finish your meal. I am not much of salad person, so that is why I am not commenting much about it (they serve before the meal).",1
2,"After all the hype, it was a bit of a letdown for ""affordable authentic French food"" and it felt a bit touristy. 
My context: At my local taphouse in a collegetown back in America, there is a Monday night dinner special where I can get a similar quality steak with mashed potatoes for $5 (with purchase of a craft beer on tap). So when I heard that this steak dinner would be an amazing deal and the sauce would be what seals it, I expected more.
What I got (everyone gets) for 24 pound deal = 
*To start: a fairly run-of-the-mill waldorf salad (walnuts, romaine, mustard-based dressing) and half of a French baguette, which was soft but cold and I would have liked some butter to go on it. I ended up dipping it in dijion mustard, as there was a jar of it on the table and I liked the kick 
*Supposed star of the show: Two servings of steak frites (cooked only at rare, medium or well, already slice and covered in a mustard-based sauce) - This might sound like the typical (possibly ignorant) American tourist, but I'm not used to already have my steak cut for me and not being able to order my desired medium rare. The sauce also tasted a bit bland to me. The frites were fine - shoe-string so extra crispy. Overall, this was plenty of food but afterward, I felt unsatisfied so I ordered dessert (rare for me!)
Ultimate letdown - the lemon tarts. I was shocked to receive what seemed like grocery chain store quality dessert as they had rock hard crust that seemed to lack sugar and a filling that tasted more saccharine rather than zippy from citrus (which I craved).
With a glass of the cheapest house red wine and gratuity added on to the bill, my dinner ran closer to 40 pounds total. So I suggest to avoid waiting in line, and instead save your money for street or pub food of similar (sometimes better) quality for a quarter of the cost.",-1
2,"Waste of time and money to be honest. Don't believe the hype - go to Entrecôte in any other city but London puts this name to shame. 
Obviously it took long to be seated but that was expected. So was the subpar service. The food was the only thing we were really there for, and it was thoroughly disappointing. We both ordered medium steak and it came pretty much well done and at room temperature. The sauce was average and they provide a lot of fries but a really stingy portion of meat. The salad was the best part but is the equivalent of what a 5 year old can make with basic kitchen ingredients. 
Apparently the profiteroles are amazing but we were both too disappointed to devote any more time or money to this establishment. 
While it is not steak frites, burger and lobster knows how to perfect its dishes while providing outstanding service. What do you know, it seems possible after all.",-1
4,"I don't know what we were thinking when we strolled over at around 7pm on a Saturday night. The line went out the door and around the corner. We waited patiently for an hour. Believe me, it was worth it. 
They've got the formula down to a delicious science, so there's little room for personalization. They won't do your steak medium-rare, for example, and wine list is pretty much ""Red or white?"" Still, those are minor inconveniences when the result is so satisfying. The one real misstep was the crazy overload of mustard in the salad dressing. 
This location is ideal: on a quiet side street around the corner from Marylebone High Street. The interior can be a bit loud and more than a bit crowded, but it feels lively rather than annoying. The service is pleasant and appropriately brisk. And they'll wrap up your leftover steak if you just can't move on to Round 2.",1
5,"I am OBSESSED with this place. I believe they have a few other restaurants across London, I've also hit up the one near Bank, which was fabulous as well. 
No menus, no BS. You get a waldorf salad, steak (sorry vegetarians) , chips and the most incredible sauce you will ever taste. You pay a flat rate (I can't remember exactly how much, I want to say £20) and you can basically have as much as you want to eat. The chips are crispy, the steak is super, and again, let me just say, THE SAUCE. You will dream of this sauce for days afterwards. I think there must be some highly addictive substance in it, because I was getting major withdrawals during the hazy weeks that followed. 
The staff are attentive, the wine is reasonable but good, and it's always a buzzy atmosphere. I'm uncertain of whether you can book a table, but normally the wait isn't too long.",1
4,"Yes, we had the steak. Yes, we had the fries. And yes, it was delicious. 
It seemed hugely touristed - and a warning - there's nothing on the menu besides steak and fries... So go for that and wine in mind, and enjoy!",1
5,"It's amazing what you run into these days with a simple ""French restaurant"" google search.
Le Relais de Venise (which I believe to mean ""Over from Venice"") is one of those cozy little restaurants neatly packed away in London's many streets and alleys. From outside it looks like a classic French cafe, which sits two minutes away from the city's busiest shopping epicenter (bond street/oxford street). 
I didn't have high expectations for this place despite the many glowing reviews my peers had given it; I quickly withdrew my preconceived notions when the meal began.
We arrived at 6:15 pm (15 minutes before the restaurant opens) - mind you, this is a Tuesday night, not the weekend - and the line of eagerly waiting customers was already curling around the corner. I knew I was in for a treat. It was rather funny once we were seated because I picked up the menu card (see photo) and there was literally ONE choice listed: The walnut salad and entrecote with a ""famous sauce."" I'm a sucker for guarded restaurant secrets and I knew that must have been the reason why everyone frequents it. The meal is split into ""first"" and ""second"" service (first and second helpings) and only costs 23 pounds (~$35).. That's like restaurant week prices back in America. 
The salad was quite simple and leafy. As I savored the tangy dijon flavor of the dressing, I took a minute to survey my surroundings. The waitresses were hustling around taking orders and serving customers. The restaurant had filled up in the first 5 minutes and there were already another 100 people waiting outside. 
Our first serving had arrived and it was a perfectly medium-rare piece of tender beef. Entrecote typically comes from the rib side of the cow, but could also be a sirloin, depending on how it's cut. I digress. The meat could have been a little warmer, but then again they were entertaining a full dinner service and the food came in a timely manner. 
The beef was smothered in the most delicious french sauces I've ever tasted. It wasn't a bearnaise as far as I could tell. And I definitely don't think there was any pepper in it. The consistency was somewhat soupy and the greenish tinge must have been taken from an herb. After several tastings, I feel like it might be basil (perhaps an allusion to Venice/Italy?). The rich, flavorful aftertaste of butter lingered on your palate after every bite -  probably a thickening agent used at the very end. The seasoning was perfect. I also tasted some garlic and maybe white wine? If it's a french sauce, they probably began with minced shallots too, which they later strained out (providing a little sweetness). But what do I know? (see photo). I ventured to ask them, and of course I got ""it's a secret.""
They gratuitously pile on a load of french fries which sort of adds an extra 500 calories to your meal, but it somehow goes well with the rest of the meat. After all, 'meat and potatoes' is always a fail-safe. When you think you're done, you're surprised to be offered another portion of everything! Each serving of beef is a little smaller than a filet, but overall, it's quite filling. It was indeed very delicious.
We finished the meal off with the Vacherin de Relais dessert; a tower of meringue and ice cream blanketed with chocolate syrup and a dollop of chantilly cream on top. So amazing (see photo). 
I would definitely come here again for this eating experience. You won't be spoiled for choice, but the one thing they offer is a home run. A toast to French cuisine. 
5/5",1
5,The steak here is the best I have ever had and the service is well timed perfection.  It is also a window into the City business scene and is very buzzy and fun to participate in.  I cannot wait to return.  P.s.  Wines by the glass are all quite good.,1
4,"Apparently, there is always a really long line here, so I would recommend going on a weekday when it isn't as bad.  When we got there, the line had just wrapped around the corner and we probably waited about 25 minutes to get seated, which went by quickly. 
The menu is fixed and consists of a salad, steak, and fries.  As soon as you sit, a server greets you and immediately asks how you want your steak cooked: rare, medium, or well done.  The bread and butter they set on the table for you is quite tasty but try not to eat too much of it, because you will have a generous portion of food coming your way.  The salad comes with a mustard vinaigrette which was delicious.  As soon as you are finished, they bring you your first portion of steak with fries.  When you finish that, they will bring your second portion of steak with MORE fries.  The steak is served with their ""famous"" sauce, which was outstanding.  They do have dessert, which looked great, but I was way too full to eat anything else.
Fun:
 They serve your main course in two portions so that it remains hot.  Also, they do have a vegetarian option available!  I believe the vegetarian meal is the salad with some sort of selection of cheeses along with the fries, and your choice of dessert.  Both the vegetarian and meat-lovers meals are only 23 pounds! Not bad for great, quality food.",1
3,"Loved the salad and the ambiance was nice, however I found the steak... disappointing. 
After all the reviews I was really hoping for something special, but it was just, ok. The green sauce was very nice, however it wasn't something I would go out of my way to get again. Woke up this morning feeling a little queasy from the amount of oil on the fries as well...
It's a shame they don't do the salad with some of the steak slices on top for £10. That would be something I'd come back for. Otherwise... it's off to try the next steak place!",-1
1,"Really don't understand the charm of this place - I did not understand it in Paris and I still don't understand in London... I think it is French, steak and all you can eat French fries at the price of 25gbp is what makes people go crazy. I personally much rather grab a good old Babette and chips for 15-20£ rather than being in this mess..
Also the steak has no crust, could argue this is how French take steaks, the green sauce has hardly any flavour, the meat is under salted... The salad tends to be over dressed - the only charm seems to be fries.. Which for me is a very bad value... 
By the way, this is one menu restaurant, salad followed by steak in green butter sauce with fries.. 
I would easily live a happy life without ever having to go.., by the way, I did not have any particularly bad experience... It is just super crowded, and chaotic for nothing for my taste.",-1
5,"If there's one thing this girl loves, it's a nice steak cooked rare and big ol' glass of red wine. Luckily for me, that is all this place served. My husband and I were in London for a weekend trip, and he had eaten at their location in The City while in London for work, but they were closed that night. SO, we went to this location instead. We arrived at about 7:30 pm on a sunday evening, and there was a line (note: they do NOT take reservations). However, we didn't stand in line for longer than 20 minutes. And, if it's cold (like it was the evening we went, there are heaters outside the building to keep you warm while you wait. 
We sat down, with my husband on the booth side of the table, and myself in a normal chair. The waitress came up and to both of our surprise, pushed the table as far back towards the wall as it would go. At first I thought, well, that was bizzarre. But after I thought about it some more, there are quite a few tables crammed into such a small building. 
Ordering dinner consisted of the following: Hello and welcome. How do you like your steak cooked? Rare. And would you like something to drink? Red wine. Okay, that'll be right out. Easiest ordering process EVER! About 2 minutes later, our salad was brought out with our wine. The other nice thing about this restaurant only serving one type of food, is that your food comes out SO fast. Which pleased my belly, I was quite hungry.
When the steak came out, and I saw a green sauce on top of it. I was a bit wary, as I've had some HORRIBLE sauces (most specifically roquefort sauces). But the sauce on the steak is great. The only thing I didn't like about eating here? There was too much food and I couldn't eat it all. Le sigh. 
I will definitely be going back to this restaurant the next time I'm in London. And just as a tip (at least while I was there), if you check in on yelp, you get half off on weekends at their canary wharf location.",1
5,I love and live for this place. The service is superlative. The steak & sauce are orgasmic.  The salad is divine. Get a bottle of the house wine.,1
3,"No reservations and only one menu. It seems like a lot of people really like this place so maybe for me it is just a personal preference issue. I would say the food was okay but I would rather pay 21 and eat elsewhere.
They start with a green salad with mustard vinaigrette topped with walnuts, followed by steak frites, £21
Your meal is servedl in two portions. There is only an option for rare or well-done.
I thought the sauce was pretty good but the meat was slightly tough. Fries were thin cut, crispy, and not too salty.
I really liked their profiteroles but they could have used a bit less chocolate sauce. It was drowning in it.",-1
5,"I came here for my Dad's birthday and my brother had told us all to meet at 6, even though the place opened at 6.30.  So we got there and felt a bit silly that we were the ONLY people standing outside at that time!  But within 10mins, the queue had already started to extend around the corner!
I like me a good tasty bit of rare steak.  And I like me some frites too.  Amazing food!  The sauce on the steak is very yum, and the steak was cooked perfectly.  Being pretty gluttonous I LOVE the fact that there are two servings!
Service is pretty rushed, but given the number of people they have to get to I didn't really mind.  However the staff were all nice and serving seemed to be carried out to military precision.
I like the fact there's no menu, takes the burden away of studying the menu and making a decision. I'd definitely come here again,",1
3,"There wasn't a line at all when I went on a weekday around 12:30pm. The place was mostly empty with a few people dotted here and there throughout. Service was quick and efficient but not exactly warm and fuzzy. It did fill up in the next hour with people mostly there for business lunch and a few solo female shoppers with masses of shopping bags. 
The meal itself wasn't bad. Steak medium was exactly medium, served with more fries than steak. The sauce looked mustardy and oily and tasted bland. I actually added mustard from the jar on the table to give it a kick. Walnut salad was iceberg lettuce drenched in a bland mustard dressing but had no walnuts. Baguette was near perfect though. A glass of wine came filled exactly to the pre-drawn line. 
Overall, this place was ok but I wouldn't wait any amount of time. Branches in other cities, including the original Paris location are fairly busy but there is usually no wait.",-1
4,"No need to worry about FOMO here, or have menu angst - there is only one single thing you can order - steak and chips.  Probably a good thing there's no choice too as they want you in and out of there as quick as is humanly possible - ain't no time for dawdling! 
So on first impression, I was wondering what all the fuss was about. We were rushed into our seats and order taken within 3 minutes (or so it felt!) There were no smiles or charm but functional swiftness.
Then came the plate. It was tiny. My friend next to me actually said the words ""I think I'm going to cry if this is all we're getting."" Fortunately, cry he did not, as actually, they give you a small plate initially, then give you a full top up once you're running low, so that the meat is kept cooked perfectly for you and the food stays hot. I've never seen this approach before and it's pretty cool I must say.
The steak comes sliced thinly, with shoestring fries and their special secret sauce on top. The sauce was unbelievably good. Between us, we couldn't figure it out. Somewhere between a gravy and a mushroom sauce with maybe a little bit of pesto thrown in?? 
My only regret was that I ordered the steak as medium (they don't do medium rare which would be my usual order) They offer 'blue', 'rare', 'medium' and 'well done', so in future I would definitely go for rare.
The food really was excellent. It's just a pity you never really feel relaxed in there, and as I said, a smile wouldn't hurt. 
Either way, I'd definitely recommend!",1
4,"It's salad, it's steak, it's fries. 
I've just come to say that I am a fan of what they do here and considering they serve only one dish, it's amazing how quickly the place filled up over the mid-week lunch hour. Since you can't book a table in advance, we were the first to arrive and be seated at around 12pm. However by 12.30pm almost every table was full of city workers and dwellers. 
For around £21, you get a first portion of salad as your starter then slices of steak and fries, served with another portion of steak and fries. They're certainly hearty portions!",1
5,"Steak is so juicy and good! I was hesitant with the sauce, but it was great. Didn't over power the steak...great compliment. I LOVE how they top up my steak serving after I've finished my plate! I have never experienced a ""refill"" in London! Well worth the price!",1
5,"For the concept, the food and the all round experience, I'm giving it 5 stars. To be honest, I really didn't want to give this place 5/5 as so many have before, it's almost a cliche.
I can't add too much that hasn't already been said... get there early, the house red is tasty and great value, the secret sauce really is delicious.
But I don't think this place gets enough kudos for it's dessrts! Let's face it, apart from what you choose to imbibe, your dessert option is the biggest decision you'll make all evening! It's a long list and we plumped for 4 of them to share. Their cheese selection was very good and the profiteroles tag-teamed with the praline ice cream was a winner.
Loved the unnannounced second serving too! I knew it was coming (Yelp told me as much) and I had a wry smile on my face when my fellow diners announced that the steak was good enough that they could eat it all over again. You should have seen their faces when our waitress started to pile more meat and frites on to their plates. 
Turns out that at L'Entrecote if you don't ask, you do get. I can work with that.",1
5,"Best. Steak. Ever.
Best. Sauce. Ever.
Best. Frites. Ever.
And really good red wine. Entrecote, if you don't mind waiting in the cold for 30 minutes before hand, is a fantastic restaurant. You're only of course going to get steak here, plus the staff can be a little bit pushy if you take more than your unquoted but obviously allotted time but it really doesn't matter - the steak is that good. The sauce is incredible, and no matter how many times I go I still get excited and tell any newcomers that they'll be getting more steak than they think, with a conspiratoral wink.
I've only been on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, but even then the place seems very busy, so I'd hesitate to say that 30 minutes is the longest you're likely to be waiting, but it really is worth it.",1
5,"It is definitely ""as good as it gets"". I thoroughly enjoyed my meal from start to finish. And for reference, I ordered my meat rare, had a glass of bordeaux, and had creme brulee for dessert. Highly recommended!!",1
4,"I went here a couple of weeks ago for a work lunch and I was very impressed - the only reason for not giving it a 5 star review is because this girl is not a huge steak fan, though I could perhaps be swayed with future efforts. 
On arrival you are presented with bread and a simple, very simple salad. Then after choosing how you want your steak cooked, usual options, not long after it arrives cooked in the most divine - and secretive! - sauce ever along with a heavily heaped portion of frites. I highly recommend the house red to go along with this too, we loved it and it goes really well with the meal. When you are reaching the end of your meal, they come along with some more slices of your steak and even more frites if you require these! 
Three out of the five in our party chose desserts and we were all impressed, I had a lovely praline gelato which I recommend.  
I would definitely recommend a visit here especially for a special occasion or a formal meal. The service was quick, efficient and friendly too making it even more of a winner. 
Located on the very trendy / sauve Marylebone Lane, just off the High Street it is convenient for walking and / or public transport due to its close proximity to Oxford Street and Baker Street.",1
2,"It's been years people told me to come here, to experience their wonderful steak and their wonderful sauce and their wonderful whatsoever.
Did I finally do it? Yes. Did I enjoy it? No. Plain. Simple.
As Everybody else said (and I mean every other 136 reviews), one choice salad, steak, fries. Stop. Strange, I was prepared for it, ok, Cool.
There is ALWAYS a queue in front of the place, on the weekend it could last for more than an hour, maybe even two. Luckily the place is REALLY crowded, otherwise there would probably a queue from there to Westminster. Ah when I mean crowded I mean SERIOUSLY crowded. I'm slim and I spent my whole time squeezed up in my seat, basically if you are more than 90 kg you'll have serious issues in finding a place here.. Maybe you are filling the place too much, you damn french business with an italian name!?!
Ah BTW, this is a french place with an italian name where most of the waitresses are polish, we had peruvian beer and english steak. Funny, for a place pretending to be french. Whatever.
Now, the meal: first is the salad, well, wow, IT'S A DAMN SALAD WITH WALNUT AND WALNUT OIL, get over with! I mean why should I even care in having such a thing? It's just a basic salad, no preparation, nothing: the pieces are even a bit too big for a salad, and there is nothing interested in it.
Then it comes the steak. Drum rolls, trumpets and bla bla. Well, nothing special. I mean seriously NOTHING SPECIAL.
The steak is good, but not that good (Wanna experience a serious steak? go to hawksmoore, THERE YOU'LL HAVE A DAMN STEAK). It comes as a ""tagliata"" (don't know the english name, sorry), basically it's already cut in slices, which is a very dangerous thing to do, as the meat will be cut somewhere and then put on the plate (actually it makes two movements after, from the cutting board to the tray and from the tray to the dish). Result: dry steak of course, as every bit of juice has been left over the two past surfaces. I mean there are serious errors, and they are making the strong points over that, how is it even possible!?!
Yeah theoretically the dryness of our tortured piece of meat will be covered by the sauce. Now, the sauce is said to be ""the best part"". No it's not. It's a bit blend, basically it's just a fatty buttery sauce with mustard and pesto, that's it. No inspiration, no soul, no feeling. Just the usual blend sauce you'll find next to the roast in any self service in every hotel in the world. Ouch.
I don't even want to speak about the fries, they are just fries, whatever. My dog can prepare it. And I don't even have a dog.
So why the two stars!?!?
RESURRECTION
INSPIRATION
HERE COMES THE DESSERT.
Yes baby, bring it on that juicy profiterole! Aaaah the profiterole , you bloody bastard! awesomely sweet on the inside, deliciously bitter on the outside, a real chocolate sauce covering splendid bigne' filled with creamy gelato. Awesome, just DAMN AWESOME.
If this place will even allow me to have just the profiterole avoiding that piece of boredom before, it'd deserve 5 stars. No, it'd deserve 6 stars, 7 stars, at least a galaxy.
LONG LIFE TO THE PROFITEROLE. HALLELUJAH.",-1
4,"Ordered: Steak and Pomme Frites
Price: about £30 including drinks
Review: Gets to the business. Steak: Done. Chips/Fries: Done. Sauce: INSANE IN THE MEMBRANE! Get on it folks. The London L'entrecote and the Paris L'entrecote are a tour de force. Not the same style as Goodmans, Hawksmore, etc. But deliciousssss",1
4,"Sometimes you don't need a lot of options one good option will suffice. That would be the case here, steak and fries but its amazing. Usually I would say getting steak in London is like eating sushi in Ohio However, these guys have a nice thing going.  I don't think they take reservations and I think you actually want to go when they are busy as they plan accordingly. 
I don't know when the line forms but its long and it takes a while so I wouldn't go if your in a hurry.",1
5,"I came to this restaurant reluctantly as I am a vegetarian and L'Entrecôte is known for the steak frites. There is not a menu, you simply state how you want your meat cooked and that is all. I specified that I wanted a vegetarian order. And I'm not going to lie I was a BIT worried. I had no idea what was going to be on my plate.
I was brought a simple salad with mixed greens, walnuts and a ""secret"" mustard dressing, which was delicious. Then they brought over the most massive, beautiful platter of assorted cheeses I have ever seen. I was able to select a bit of each cheese, which came out to be about 6 different cheeses, and quite large portions at that. From the brie to the roquefort, each one was DIVINE. Needless to say, I was the happiest camper. With my cheese, greens, and delicious glass of red, I was in heaven.
And for those of you that do in fact eat meat, this is obviously the place for you. You do not only get one portion of steak, but they will bring you a second serving if you like. Their secret recipe for the green sauce that is put in the steak is incredible, I tried a spoonful. The chips are delicious too and are great for dipping in any of extra special sauce you have left on your plate.
Service is quite good here and they move rather quickly. Be prepared to shout, as the restaurant is quite loud. But it has a wonderful vibe and buzz to it. The puddings menu is quite extensive with tons of options. From rich crème brûlée to lighter sorbet options, there is something for everyone. 
So all you vegetarians out there should never fear the lovely L'Entrecôte. It is definitely worth waiting in the que for.",1
4,"OOOOOH ERIN L You're from Texas so you know steak so much better than Brits?
Well ERIN, Texas is approximately 3 times the size of all of England, and they produce beef here as well (2 million heads per annum vs 6 million in Texas) and Texas is a big exporter of beef, but England consumes most locally so perhaps Texans aren't that much more fluent in cow than the English?  The numbers suggest there are as many cows per acre here as Texas -- that does sound wrong doesn't it?
Ok all that said, Texas steaks probably are better, but this is a grain-fed vs. grass-fed discussion, and reviewing a French restaurant is probably not the best place to do so. 
A meal at Le Relais is 50% food, 50% some schmuck tourist friend made me stand in a line for a restaurant that only does one dish.  I really enjoyed my last meal there, especially the salad and the fries.  Having recently eaten at 5 Guys, I don't think that is a fair comparison; McDs vs Relaix would've been more apt, as 5 Guys serve those skin-on peanut oil reeking variety which, lets be honest, are subpar to anyone that knows anything about french fries.
I don't recall the room being so tight and the service being so snotty, but perhaps tight is relative to a Texan, you fat pigs -- JOKING, it is a bit tight in there, but as far as service goes, it depends on the server and how busy it is.  
The steak is quite good, though could be overly lean if one is splitting hairs, and I do enjoy the sauce.  That said, there are loads of great new steakhouses in London which might get my money before Le Relais.",1
5,"It's very simple. There's only one thing on the menu. In fact, there is no menu.
Salad, steak, and fries. That's it. 
AND MY GOD, IT IS AMAZING!!!",1
4,"My brother- and sister-in-law brought me to this restaurant last week. As odd as the concept is - serving one thing - it really works. 
The salad was just OK, but the steak and fries were divine. The house red paired well with it all. 
It's a lively noisy place and they really pack the tables close together. I didn't mind at all. Good company, good food, and a little buzz from the wine. That's a proper night out if you ask me. 
The lines goes at a fast pace, so don't panic if you see it snake around the side of the building.",1
4,"Sometimes you want a Heston-type meal, prepared with all sorts of whizzy science-lab-like techniques plated with impeccable artistry on a piece of slate or a board or something that seems stylish at the time. And sometimes you want a well-prepared comforting meal on a plate.
Relais does a good rendition of the latter, serving a well-crafted and comforting meal that always leaves me feeling like my soul has gotten a tiny bit of nourishment on top of the healthy meal I've just enjoyed.
It's decent value and for your money you'll have a good meal. You won't spend a lot of time pouring over the menu because it's basically steak. And frites. They're brought to you in two batches (so you don't end your meal with cold frites) with a highly addictive and mysterious secret sauce. The service could be warmer - they certainly don't aim to connect with you -  but the food itself always seems to tick the boxes, done exactly as it should be done, served in just the right amounts at the right time.
For those of you visiting from the States, I'll leave two comments based on previous reviews and I'll preface those comments by saying I also am from (Gasp! Horror!) Texas.
1. This may seem like an expensive meal because of the exchange rate but actually by London standards it's not and is actually great value.
2. You can't compare Relais to places in the states (or in London) that are or sell themselves as high-end. That's not what this place is about. It's a steak frites place, not the latest and greatest high-priced steakhouse. Will Relais serve you the best steak you've ever had? Nope. Will they serve you a well-prepared meal and bring you back for more? Yup.",1
4,"ZOMG a waiting line at 10p! That's 30 mins before closing time.
Hmm this will be hard to rate but here is my go at it:
3* cut of meat. 
3* The green sauce, my guess, is a mixture of mustard and some green herb that reminds me of a tartier, more reduced curry mussamam for some odd reason. 
4* at my medium meat. Pink with occasional hints of red liquid.
4* for menu choice. Can't beat ""the only thing you get to decide on is how you want your meat cooked"". Love the simplicity of it.
5* on the way its served. The second serving with the 1/3 meat + fresh extra crispy frites is a great idea. I was getting full but the crunch of the fresh frites made me wanna finish my meal up.
5* on the le profiteroles du chocolate- at my server's recommendation when I asked for something chocolaty thats not too sweet. Its thin choux pastry with vanilla ice cream, drenched in melted dark chocolate sauce and almond slices. (Note: my mouth is drooling as I am writing the description. I want it again!) The sensation of hot and cold in your mouth makes it extra yummy.
6* for cute french maids in french maid outfits with matching cute personalities
6* for service level and the way the servers handled drama. There was an overly boisterous drunk dude that stood up and started clapping at his table. Moments later he fell off his seat, hitting the customer behind me. 3 of the servers came and talked to him. One talked to him, the other two reassured the surrounding diners. 15 mins later, he started banging on the table really loudly several times and was extremely loud in his proclamations. My server went over to placate him. He instantly had his hand around her waist and as they talked, his hand went to her butt! She calmly finished talking to him and deftly maneuvered his hand away. I would have gave him a resounding punch or a kick in the groin if I was in her shoes. 
Anyway.. its a nice experience overall",1
4,"This place has focused on steak frites and it's great.  You get salad and bread for the starter and then you have a serving of steak and fries.  The only choice you have is how well you would like your steak cooked.  Then, when you have finished your meal, the waitress comes over to give you top-up steak and fries!  The sauce is tasty and I mopped up the rest of it with french bread.
Actually, there are times when you can have choices: the wine list and dessert time.  We had nice glasses of rose and red, but we declined dessert because we were nicely full of steak and fries.
There is a minimum charge of £21 per person, but this is conveniently the charge for the steak frites meal, excluding drinks and dessert.  With drinks, our bill was just over £50 for both of us.  This is reasonable for London restaurant prices and I think we will be back sometime.
Note: you can't make bookings and we were able to get a table right away on Friday night because we got there at 6:30pm.  By the time we left, there was a decent line that turned the corner of the building outside.",1
3,"I'd been dying to go here for weeks. Tonight all the stars aligned and I landed a table after only about a 10 minute wait. 
In truth, I was a bit disappointed- I expected soooo much more. I suspect that it was my own build up based on reviews than their actual shortcomings. All in all, the steak was good, fries were tasty, and the sauce was interesting... sadly, it was a long way from the best steak I've ever had and odds are, I'd try another steak house before going back...",-1
3,"We never had steak and frites before and you would think that we would head over to Paris first to try it.  Hubby found this place on Yelp and since it was close to where we were heading, we decided to give it a try anyways.
The servers were mostly all french hence the restaurant's name and even though we came right around lunch time, we were able to be seated fairly quickly. 
Just like most of the reviewers, steak and frites is the only thing on the menu.  You let the server know how you want the steak to be done and in a few minutes, you see them bring over trays to the counter and our server started preparing our dish.  
I thought it was interesting that after we were finished with our first dish, she came back again with the rest of our steak and frites to replenish.  It makes us feel like we were in a buffet but then realize that it was just the rest of our steak.  I think I would've been fine having them give it all to me at once but I guess it's the experience.
Most of european restaurants now bring over a portable credit card machine to finish the bill transaction which is good IMO.  Definitely cuts out alot of CC fraud if any.  Although I can't say the same for this restaurant since we felt like we were robbed of our money when the bill came out to be $70 US for lunch.  That's the most we've ever paid for lunch and frankly, I think I would've been ok with a croissant sandwich in one of those takeaway restaurants. 
So yeah, doubt we'll ever come to eat at this place especially when the pounds are so dang expensive compared to euro dollars now.  Oh well, live and learn. =D",-1
5,"We are huge fans of the Paris restaurant near Champs Élysées, so we were thrilled to go here in London.  Always go before they open and ljoin the queue.  We happened to be there on a bank holiday and they opened up at 6:30 instead of 6.  We made sure to ask for more sauce and bread to soak it up with, we are not shy- the sauce is so unique.  We ordered the profiteroles and several orders of vacheron.  The vacheron is hands down the best dessert ever!  The tower of ice cream, meringue and hazelnut chocolate sauce is not to be missed.",1
3,"So I had lunch at this place the other day. I had eaten at the one in New York before, so I had an idea of what to expect.
The very first part of the experience was the worst part. We got there and saw a line out front waiting to get in. Unfortunately, everyone had to wait on it, both large and small groups. This was a bit disappointing since sometimes a party of two can get seated quickly in a crowded venue. Anyway we waited and it wasn't the end of the world.
Once we got seated, everything was great. There isn't much of a selection here as I think the only things you can get as a main are steak and fries. There could be other options, but we were both quite happy to have the steak and fries.
Basically, the server just asks you how you like your steak and then brings you sliced steak and fries. It was quite good.
After the main course we had deserts which were also quite good.
Throughout the whole meal, service was great.
I would definitely come back here, just not at a peak time. It might be a good place for a late lunch as there was practically no line to get in when we were leaving.",-1
5,"Hmmmm, let's see here. The only thing they serve here is beautiful steak (with a crack like sauce), frites, and salad for ridiculously cheap. Then they bring you a second helping. 
Yeah, I'll wait in line for that. Again, and again, and again...",1
4,"We made a reservation for Thursday evening, and thank goodness we did because the line was snaking out the door.
Once seated, we ordered the £21 prix fixe.  Bread and salad for the table were solid, but we all know we were really there for.  By the time we finished it, we were like sharks during feeding time- stalking the waitress at the corner of our hungry little eyes and hoping she would come around soon to feed our hungry little mouths.
And 5 minutes she returned to the shark pen with plates full of crispy thin fries and six slices of meat doused in green sauce.  I mistakenly asked for medium and I think the medium was actually more medium-well, and the rare was actually medium.  Order rare when asked, please make your experience that much more worth it.
By the way I don't know what they put in that sauce, but it is in-sauce-xicating.  Pun fail, I think so.  I could drink that sauce.
The nicest part of this was that they come around with a second helping.  Surprise- more meat!  Can't complain about that, even if the meat was nothing mind blowing.  That sauce though, I'm coming back for you.",1
4,"When the paradox of choice leaves you wanting to opt out, trust Le Relais De Venise L'Entrecote to do the decision making for you. The only choice this restaurant will have you make is regarding the temperature of your steak. 
As for wine, make it the house red; great drinkability at a decent price point.
Soon after you place your order a pile of salad will arrive at your table dressed in a light mustardy vinaigrette with half a handful of walnuts strewn over the top. This salad tastes better than its homely appearance would have you believe.
Next comes the steak, doused in a green sauce (don't ask what's in it, the recipe is highly guarded) and accompanied by a pile of fries. But this is only the beginning - one more portion of meat and frites is still to come! Who doesn't love seconds, right?
It's no surprise they do not have ketchup but no aioli either? Mustard was no stand in dipper for my frites and I was left wishing for a bit of mayonnaisey goodness. However, I soon realized that the secret green sauce did the trick. 
Le Relais De Venise L'Entrecote is a lovely little respite from poring over menus night after night in search of what's good. They serve one thing only and they do it very well.",1
5,"Steak Frites!  Steak Frites!  Steak Frites!  That's all I heard from my local friend about this place.  ""We gotta go to steak frites!""  I asked my friend, ""is the place really called steak frites?""  ""No it's not, not sure exactly the name but we need to get there early to get in line- 5:30PM.  WTF!  
Anyway, after watching the Chelsea/Portsmouth match at a local pub, which shall go nameless, we walked towards Steak Frites!  The build up to Steak Frites! was unbearable.  My friend Sean, kept talking about the one item menu, the salad, the sauce that comes with the steak, the top notch fries, how you can have seconds...etc....  I was salivating- unfortunately we arrived at 5PM and they were not open yet, but we were second line!.  
The brilliant part about this location is that if you get there early, you can go across the alley to the Italian restaurant (which is open), sidle up to the bar and order spiritous libations while you wait for Steak Frites! to open.  Double Jack and Coke, extra ice, keep 'em coming and thanks to Stacy for waiting in line while we went for drinks.  By the way, if you sweet talk the bartendress, she'll put your bev in a paper cup so you can go back across the street and relieve your compatriots.
OK- finally, we were seated and this place was true to the hype.  Cute waitressess in French maids outfits, no menu, just how do you want the steak and how's your wine list- well done!  The salad with mustard dressing was devine.  The Steak Frites! were fantastic!  The sauce- nonpareil!  You will not find a better sauce.  The best part is they keep a second helping on the flame so you can have more-  then you build the perfect bite- a bit of steak, mashed into some Frites! and then dipped in their secret sauce and it is game on!  Fucking Delicious!
How can a restaurant serve just one thing and stay in business.  Well.... just go here and find out.  You will be rewarded!
Oh, by the way, they have dessert too.  Get it!
God bless this place and all the ships at sea!",1
5,"This is one of those places with cult followings that you just have to check out. A little real London culture.
If you're reading this, you know everything awesome about this place. Yes, the sauce is that good.
BUT HERE'S THE MEGASICKTIP: Generally there's huge lines. like, 1 hour and 15 minutes on a saturday at 7:30 kind of lines. But I found a mini loop hole: go for the first seating (they open at 6:30, so queue up before then) OR go on SUNDAY around 8. At that point there was no line at all.
*NOTE: I saw that they actually do have vegetarian options. It's the regular starter salad, a more baller salad as a main, and a free dessert.
Carry on.",1
4,"Between this and the Canary Warf location. Come here. Between this location and Paris... Well. Hop on that train to Paris!!
Not much can be said about Relais. It's a sweet n short menu that delivers some good comfort eats. I definitely recommend either medium or medium rare for the steak. And definitely try your luck at getting some extra sauce while you're at it! The desserts are the only part of the experience that you can probably skip on and find better options elsewhere.",1
4,Fantastic French steak resturant. Unique that it's a salad to start and steak and fries. That's the choice you have and you just say how you want your steak cooked. You must turn up early and wait in the queue. If you are there before it opens and happen to be around 2m round the corner you may just make the first sit in. If you are further then be ready to wait around an hour or so before you get in. So dress well and be prepared.,1
3,"It's a cool idea to only have one thing on the menu as it makes ordering pretty quick, which is more than can be said for the wait outside. I normally REALLY hate queueing for food in London, as you're never normally more than a five minute walk away from another good eaterie. A twenty minute queue on a Wednesday night in November was a bit excessive in my opinion (but in spite of looking up alternatives on my friend's iPad we stayed the course).
 It was sort of worth the wait, as after a while you just think, we've waited this long we may as well stay. Would I do it again? Probably not.
 Steak was well cooked, the sauce tasty, the mustardy dressing on the salad was very mustardy and with two helpings, I was full.
 Profiteroles were yummy (although extremely cold fillings - not sure if it was icecream) and the tarte citron very good.
 I'm glad I went but for another twenty minute queue it would have to be super special.",-1
4,"I had been meaning to go here for some time, and an impromptu dinner with an old friend meant I finally got my chance.. 
With only a set menu you given the wine list  and desserts to chose from. The simple menu means that what they do cook they cook well, or medium should I say.
My l'entrecote steak was delicious, full of flavour and tender, cut into slices and smothered in a 'special green' sauce. Accompanied by chips that kept being refreshed, yum. The biggest and best surprise of the evening was when I was brought over a second helping of steak! What a place, and all included in the price of the set menu. 
I finished with a creme brulee which tasted just perfect!
I would certainly return, although with wine our bill did come to £70- (for 2) so not somewhere I will be going every week. 
Tips: 
1) Skip the starter salad, save space for chips and beef.
2) Come early or you'll have to queue this place doesn't take reservations.",1
3,"I would call this place the McDonalds of steak. You get a fantastic deal on steak, salad, and fries. The food is good, but not amazing. 
I won't repeat what the other reviews attest to other than to confirm that: 
1) We waited about 45 minutes in a queue snaking around the corner.
2) There is no main menu. Drinks and desert are extra.
3) Vegetarian (cheese platter) includes desert ""free"".
4) The green sauce is delish.
Everything is rushed. The interior is loud. Waitresses in French-maid getups quickly serve you food in an efficient manner. Fries are ""pre-cooked"" (i.e., not made to order) and sit in a large tray waiting to be dished out to you. The house wine was pretty good.
For the steak itself, it is served in slices with green sauce. Americans who like their steak grilled will be disappointed. The steak reminds one of brisket. The steak is good, but again, not awe-inspiring. Don't expect Kobe beef.
The desert was disappointing. I ordered the creme puffs and my friend ordered something resembling stacked macaroons. The pastries themselves were OK, but they were slathered in chocolate. It's like someone got a bottle of Hershey's chocolate syrup and went loco. Not what I expect from a French restaurant.
All in all Le Relais provides a unique experience in that it efficiently serves a single menu item at a good price. Just don't be fooled by the long name of the restaurant, this isn't fine dining.",-1
4,"I took my boyfriend here and he declared it his new favorite restaurant. No faffing around and you get a second portion without having to ask? Awesome.
I'm not sure what's in that sauce (besides lots and lots of butter), but it was delicious on my steak, fries and bread. If I had something else to dip in it, I would have. Sure it's not the highest quality of steak, but that's not what you're going for.",1
4,"Not bad, steak-freedom-fries only, so don't go with other ideas in mind.
Staff a bit cheeky and linguistically challenged.
Good for a quick lunch Bistro style.",1
4,"This place is very simple and clear. you go there knowing what you will get in terms of food and how much you will pay. 
You don't have to wait for long to check a menu then decide, it is only one dish plus salad
the service and food serving is very quick
portion is just OK, and taste is good. 
Ideal for quick lunch",1
5,"A very worthy sibling of Relais de Venise in the City (Throgmorton Street), this one has a ri-di-cu-lous queue starting from the moment it opens. Especially on Saturday evenings. 
The secret is, of course, that it's open on Saturday, at least. The City one is shut.
Oh, and when you dine at either of them, keep your receipt, and you'll get 20% off your next lunch in Marylebone or dinner in the City. (there's a time limit of about a month or so)",1
1,"Not remotely worth £20.
If you advertise yourself as The Place to Go for steak frites, you had better be good. First the good things: the ambiance was noisy and convivial, the salad was excellent and the frites were spot on.
The steak, however, came in a roughly 6 ounce serving, drowned in a pleasant but nondescript green sauce. The meat under the sauce could just as easily have been mushrooms chicken or tofu. 
There were seconds, which brought the total steak serving up to around 9 ounces.
So  £20 seems to me a lot to pay for a salad and frites, however good. Seldom has this happened, but I really felt ripped off.
Go get a steak frites at your local, you will almost certainly get better quality at a better price.",-1
3,"Here's one American who didn't think this place was all that amazing.  
Before I get lambasted, here are the reasons why.  
1) It was marketed to me as a great one-of-a-kind establishment, but it turns out they're a chain with locations all around the world.  
2) Rushed service - since everyone knows what you're basically going to order, wine/bread/salad/steak/frites are essentially dumped out in front of you.
3) I really hate it when waitresses ask you for still or sparkling, you say still, and they pop the cap off an expensive bottle of Evian.  Well, you won't get me again - I say tap water everywhere I go now.
4) Nothing was that amazing.  The salad had this garlic dressing (in all honesty, it's been a while, the flavor might not have been garlic, but it was really strong whatever it was) that completely overpowered the rest of the salad, the steak had only what seemed to be a watered-down curry flavor, and the frites were tiny.  I also didn't love when they gave me more food.  Now don't get me wrong, I do love getting free food, but the way they present it has all the trappings of shoveling gruel on your plate.  The desserts looked amazing, and I ordered this macaroon tower, but they also failed to impress.
5)  Finally, I realize they can do nothing about this, but does every freakin' person in the UK smoke?  Waiting in the 1 hour queue, we were continually blasted by smoke.  
On the other hand, the two people waiting behind us were a lot of fun - a great way to meet new people.  
Anyways, if I ever want to eat here again, (and I don't), I'll just go to one of the US locations...no reason to go to a US chain when I'm overseas, and I won't be making that mistake again.",-1
5,"Such a simple concept, but one of the most enjoyable evenings I've had in a while. They don't take reservations so you start by queuing outside the restaurant, but with the heat lamps and company it can be quite an enjoyable wait. 
Once you're seated you are presented with a fairly bland looking salad of greens, walnuts and mustard dressing accompanied by freshly baked French bread. But as I learned last night, looks can be deceiving. The mustard dressing is complex in flavour and makes the salad truly spectacular. 
You are then given one choice, how would you like your steak cooked... rare, medium or well done. It's positively criminal to order anything other than rare. But don't worry, although rare arrives very red in colour, it does not bleed all over the plate. The steak is covered in a mystery green sauce. I have no idea what's in it, but wow it's delicious. And of course the steak is accompanied by piles of frites. Just when you think you're starting to feel full, a second helping of steak and frites are served. I ate the steak (how can you not?), but had to leave the frites so I would have room for dessert.  
To accompany our meal we had the house red, again it was fantastic, perfectly complementing the meal. Desserts are also delicious. I would recommend the profiteroles that are served with ice-cream instead of cream. 
All this and just £20 a head + wine and dessert. Not a bad deal at all!",1
5,"Just found this place by accident. What a find!  The menu never changes -- but who cares?  It's a great one!  Delicious salad, steak with yummy sauce and perfectly cooked chips.
Best to go early as a queue develops outside. Don't take reservations and won't seat you until all members of your party are present.
They do have a vegetarian option.",1
5,"This is quite the bizarre yet cute and cosy little place in Marylebone. I think that from over a hundred reviews it's obvious that it serves only one type of food - steak. I asked for my take to be medium rare and washed it down with a glass of red wine. It is as simple as that but the meal is truly worth it the long line that will surely wait for you no matter when you go. That being the main setback, consider the place a lovely dinner option and a real treat if you're a steak-lover like me.",1
3,"After months of wanting to come here, but knowing about the queues, we were finally out and about in London and ready to eat right about the time they opened, so I figured it would be the perfect time to go (as no queue, right?) Luckily I was right and we got right in.
The menu, easy, steak and fries. And a salad to start. We get our salads and order our wine. The wine comes, the waitress opens it, pours a partial glass (for tasting I assume) and then sets the wine down on the table and walks off? What? Um, shouldn't you wait to make sure the wine is okay before you just leave in on the table and disappear. I mean, if it's not, I suppose we don't have to pour it and drink it, but given the servers come around practically never, that's really not an option. So I take a sip, and joking look over my shoulder, ""Oh yes, that's great thanks!"" Then the wine turns out to be NOT the wine we ordered. Luckily it was a cheaper wine, so we didn't feel so bad about drinking it, and it was quite tasty, but still, why can't the waitress remember what wine to bring? At this point I comment that perhaps they're going for the authentic French experience: rude waitstaff. Except that every place I've been to in France, they've been more than courteous and not at all rude, so clearly if that's what they're going for, they'd going for the stereotype.
The steaks arrived. They are arranged fairly unattractively on a small plate with a pile of chips on the side. It was decidingly unattractive and unappealing. You'd think a restaurant that does ONE dish would be able to do it in a way that actually makes it appealing to eat. It also seemed a bit small, but for some unknown reason (because it keeps the food hot maybe? I don't really know) they bring a second portion of the food around when you're done.
The food though, yeah it was good. The steak was cooked rare and the sauce was tasty. The chips were also great (and I used some of the mustard on them, tasty). Weirdly though, the steak itself was kind of chewy and not really that great. Again, you'd think a restaurant that ONLY MAKES THIS DISH would make it perfectly. I can cook a better steak at home. Who are the chefs that work here?
We get dessert: The other half orders cheese and I order the raspberry tart. I then get up to use the bathroom, and when I return, there are two strawberry tarts on the table. Um, I ordered raspberry. So I can see why they only do one dish now, because that way the servers don't have to remember what people order because clearly they can't. About five minutes later, the cheese finally comes. They serve my other half up some cheese (and it's a lot of cheese, be prepared if you order the cheese for dessert). I mention that they brought the wrong tarts. The server gave me the ugliest stare for even mentioning that it was wrong, but they said they'd bring me the correct tarts. Then they say they'll bring bread for the cheese. Afterwards, I turn to my other half and say, ""Hmm, I wonder which they'll bring first, the tarts or the bread"". Turns out I won, as the tarts turned up. I slowly start eating my tarts (which were quite tasty), and no bread shows up. Finally, I turn around and grab some random person walking by and say, ""Can we get some bread for the cheese?""
She gets bread, then notices that they didn't bring a knife for the cheese (at least this one noticed), so she ran off to get the bread. The cheese turned out quite nice, but we paid the bill and left, and noticed the queue outside the door as we walked away.
Bottom line: The steaks were alright, nothing special. The desserts were good. It's worth the price, but not the wait, so go if you're planning on going early, but not if you're planning on waiting in the queue. The service is definitely not worth it (and given they only do ONE dish, you'd think they'd be WAY more organized than they actually are). And honestly, I had a better steak at La Petite Maison (and hey they actually take reservations, so you don't have to queue). I'm beginning to think that Londoners actually just really like queuing, regardless of the quality of product they'll be receiving (Monmouth coffee anyone?). Herd mentality, maybe? I don't know, but I'll be dining elsewhere for steak thank you.",-1
4,"Summary: Great steak, good fries, fun experience.
Came on a weekday night around 9 PM - and there was still a 20 min wait to get in.
Salad was good, but not spectacular. I ordered the steak rare, which it was. Fries were good when hot, but didn't hold their crispness throughout the meal, which was unfortunate. Seeing the servers and how they dealt with keeping the steak warm was interesting. I like the idea of keeping the meat warm - I personally think it's a waste to let a juicy, oozing piece of meat turn into a cold steak with congealed fat.
Would come back again with a friend if they waned, but probably not by myself anytime soon due to the inconvenience factor.",1
5,"Excellent.  Really fun place with a great but simple menu - salad, steak, chips and red wine.  Crowded, but worth the wait.  Friendly, authentic staff too.",1
4,"Salad. Steak. Chips.  That's it.  One set menu for a mere £19 - take it or leave it.  And people are taking it... queuing up for it in fact.
I'm actually a vegetarian, so I've never dined here... but my friends *rave.*  They talk about how amazing the beef is... how the secret signature sauce is mouthwatering... and what a unique and impressive place this is to bring a date (provided they're a carnivore).
This London branch is a replica of the original successful establishment in Paris that's been a popular Parisian brasserie for nearly 50 years.  
I love the simplicity of the concept, the secrecy of the sauce, and the established Parisan history... it all sounds so neat... if you're a beef eater at all, I highly suggest ye get thee here...",1
3,"Perhaps it's a case of the Yelp curse- a well-rated restaurant with reviews that set your expectations so high, even a great restaurant couldn't possibly live up to the hype- but I wasn't all that impressed. 
If you stumbled on this restaurant and had no idea what it was, you'd probably rate it 2 stars. Why? Let's see. After waiting outside (not terrible I must admit) you're rushed into a jam-packed restaurant, only to be sat at a table so close to the one next to it that it must be pulled all the way out before it's shoved back trapping you in the booth. Then you're met by a ""waitress"" who appears to be dressed for Halloween who asks only ""how do you want it cooked."" At this point you had better have figured out you're there for steak, or you're screwed. They then scribble your preference on a paper table cloth and are gone. Someone else comes by less than 30 seconds later, throws a forgettable salad down and disappears. Five minutes later a different waitress returns, tosses down a plate of steak smothered in watery green sauce and overcooked, soggy fries and is gone. Sure you get two servings, but I'd trade quality over quantity any day. 
In short:
Service? Non-existent, and my standards are low. 
Steak? I've had better off a George Foreman grill. 
Green sauce? Seemed a bit watery and rather flavorless given all the hype. This can't be the best London can do. 
Overall? Not terrible, but certainly not five stars. I thought the meal was ""good,"" but certainly not exceptional. 
Full disclosure: I lived in Texas for a few years, so maybe I'm biased, but I've had better steak at even upscale chain restaurants like Ruth's Chris, and better fries at Five Guys. Go for the experience, if you must, but set expectations accordingly.",-1
4,I need to come back here more often.  I always go with rare (equals to about medium cooked steak in NY) and the house wine is quite good.  I don't know what's in that green sauce but it is absolutely brilliant.,1
3,"Some places lose a step when they aren't busy, this place, with the high art that is the timing of fries and thin meat, loses about about 10. The salad is still great, but not overly generous. All this even after I got a free bottle of wine. Hmm?",-1
4,"Find something simple and do it well.  Relais takes this formula and does it in spades.  Tender, flavourful entrecôte topped with mouth-watering butter herb sauce, perfectly cooked fries, and fresh green salad.  Being first-timers here, we were pleasantly surprised when our server came by to offer us MORE slices of juicy bovine after we had already finished our first portion of what I thought was a generous helping already.  The idea is they serve half first, then keep the other half on a warmer so that your steak never gets cold.  The atmosphere is bustling; the waitresses pretty and efficient.  Oh and a French family were gorging themselves next to our table so that's always a good sign.  Thumbs up!",1
4,"So upon arriving at this restaurant, we realized that there was a line. What we didn't realize right away was that line went all the way around the block. My friend and I decided we'd go somewhere else. As we were about to leave, we saw them letting in 10 people so we turned back around and decided we'd stick it out. My point here is that the line goes at a moderate pace. We ended up waiting about 30-35 minutes until we were seated.
The concept is simple, you sit down, you get a salad and bread as a starter, french fries and steak as the main course. You can get a second serving of the steak and fries but that's it. No thirds. 
The fries were delicious. I like the thin french fries instead of the thick chips they sell here in the UK. The steak was delicious and the sauce (bernaise?) was even better. 
I give them 5 stars for the food and 3 stars for their service. So....4 stars altogether.",1
4,"Excellent steak and endless fries! The special sauce is really delicious! It's hard for me to pin point what's in it. I've been here a couple if times and although its not cheap, I walk out very satisfied. It's a really nice place, the service is excellent and the steak is really perfectly cooked and served. The bread, salad and fries given are also very delicious and fresh. They have perfected every item that will be served up. Great place to take someone for something nice or for a small group of friends.",1
5,"Fucking amazing. Worth the wait, the line. Steak frites, meat baby ...yummmm.",1
4,"The meat they served was very well prepared (I got it cooked exactly as I ordered) and definitely of the good quality. Chips were good. However, the restaurant was very crowded and be aware for a long queue if u pop in at night.",1
4,"Yes, I am a big fan! I love french food and really enjoyed my time here. 
They start by asking how you want the meat, I took a star off cus I got medium and it was a bit too cooked. Next time I will get the rare. Other than that, the frites and wine were pure bliss.
AND, for desert i had profiterol, and they were one of the most amazing desserts ever!! yum yum yum.
It was quiet pricey but well worth it when you have great company.",1
4,"I will be eternally grateful to my friend Aymen for introducing me to this place. The queue is worth it trust me. Just go and tell me otherwise. I thought about asking for ketchup and was quickly shot down. They take their food seriously here and so they should. The green sauce is amazing on its own,with the perfectly cooked steak and with the fries. The waitresses outfits are also cool ;)",1
4,"Choice is over - rated, particularly when at the end of an over - stimulating day the perfect trifecta is a carnivore's dream served with a  heaping portion of crisp - to - perfection chips and a decent (drinkable) house red wine.  But wait, the surprise is in the second round of the same, so hold off on mediocre bread, and indulge in heaping round two. As you well know by the rest of these reviews, you are choice - less on menu options here, other than the temperature of the meat, and my advice  - just say bloody rare...
I admit that I wasn't entirley oozing with love of the service or the 'all -business, no mingleness' of the server but it/she, like the food was reliable and uncomplicated.  It is yes, as it sounds - the perfect affair, ticks all of your needs, remains consistent and is never complicated.   I would say just who doesn't love a bloody steak and mound of perfect chips, but I imagine Jains, Jivamukti Yoga practitioners and Heather Mills might become irrational at this suggestion. If in fact you are of the few which like your steak trimmed and well-prepared, and your sauces basic, it is a simple must try at least once.
8:30 on a Weds = queue which moves fairly rapidly, but be forewarned, if you want to eat with the rest of the neighbourhood consultants wear gloves.",1
5,"It does what it says on the box.  Salad, steak, fries.  And an excellent sauce - something like anchovies, pesto, and more butter than even butter contains.
FYI, I like the City restaurant more than the Marylebone restaurant since it's less busy and you never have to wait.",1
5,"Set menu, starter and main. Really simple and really tasty.  Salad, steak and frites... what more could you want? Great for lunch.",1
4,"Set menu. You get a two course meal. First course: streak and frites. Second course: more steak and frites. You can have your steak prepared one of four ways: blue, rare, medium, well done. Don't even bother trying to deviate from one of the four options; medium rare is not an acceptable option and you will be scoffed at for the request. It's on the pricey side but definitely worth it if you're a steak fan. I am not a steak fan and I still enjoyed myself and the food. I'd definitely come back if I were in London again. Just a side note: dress schfancy.",1
4,"This is probably one of my favourite restaurants in London. It is definitely fair to say that I agree with some of the poor reviews below but this is mainly down to fussy eating/not wholly realising the concept before going.
One thing to understand is that this is NOT a take your time over several bottles of wine place  the service is rushed and there is always a queue outside! The menu is fixed but if you are a fan of steak frites, this is definitely the place for you!
I think £20 for a three course meal is pretty reasonable in London. Admittedly some wine included would be nice but hey, treat yourself.
Perfect place to go if you want to squeeze dinner in before a show on the West End or have the evening sightseeing in London.",1
5,"Gorgeous place - wait in line (its worth it...) -get seated - quickfire the waitress arrives -eat salad with mustard dressing and walnuts and french fresh bread-  very nice fries and thin beautifully cooked steak in green sauce arrives - have a glass of wine- share your dessert - and go on your way .  They don't rush you ..but you know the deal ..take an hour have a great meal ..rare ?medium? well done? 
A lovely professional French experience, will go here lots and lots. Perfect for Sunday lunchtime or any evening you can't think where to go. Delicious , More professional restaurants please !! Love it !",1
5,"I'm pretty sure my husband would kick the world's cutest puppy just for a chance to go here every night of the week.  
Me... well, I think it's pretty good, too.  Not kick-a-puppy-worthy, but very good.  Big fan of the house wine (it's well priced at 15 GBP a bottle), the waitresses in their cute little French maid outfits, and the prompt service.  The oft-dreaded no-reservations policy is a drag, but the line always moves quickly.  Do yourself a favour and get there at 18:30, and there won't be a wait at all!   It's really one of the best values in London, the land of over-priced everything.",1
5,"Sooooooo simple, yet sooooo good!!!! Even the salad!",1
5,"The best meal we had in London! Close seating like a Parisian cafe and efficient service. This place is a well oiled machine!
The food was great! No complaints at all, and I love that you get extra steak and fries :) We had the *delish* profiteroles for dessert even though I could barely fit them in my belly. Attentive, friendly service too. 
I thought it was a bit hard to find (being an outsider) so we took a cab- if you're coming from near Piccadilly it's only £6 and totally worth it!",1
5,"I've long been a fan of the Relais de L'Entrecôte restaurants in Paris (3) and Geneve (1), but somehow until recently had failed to spot this one more on my own doorstep (all are run by members of the original founder's extended family).
A simple concept - ""Steak/Frites Plus"" - but well executed.",1
4,"Let my forewarn you, dear reader, that my entire experience at this restaurant, as at so many restaurants, was spent in a very pleasant mental fog induced by copious amounts of alcohol imbibed over the course of a warmish English summer's day.  Thus this review is more of a hazy recollection of the overall sensory experience of eating at Entrecote rather than a blow by blow account of what was quite a good meal.
I arrived at Entrecote in my customary style:  stumbling out of a cab and most likely leaving the bill for some poor sod in my company to pay.  It's easy to sum up my first impressions:  ""gee, that's a long line"".  Entrecote doesn't take bookings and so unless you time your visit cleverly you will have to hang around outside for 20 or 30 minutes.  The most observant readers out there may have noticed that I was the slightest bit sozzled and might have inferred -- correctly -- that I was not the sharpest tool in the drawer at this point of the night.
There followed a rather unpleasant minute or two in which I wondered how it would feel to be 20 minutes soberer in 20 minutes time, when my next alcoholic beverage could presumably be procured.  I was fortunately saved from the deep depression this sobering thought (excuse the pun) engendered by a rather wonderful group of lesbians in front of me who most ingeniously went to the pub across the street and came back with a tray of drinks!  This made the wait in the queue pass in a most agreeable fashion.
Second impression:  good atmosphere.  Third impression:  where's the menu?  Entrecote serve...well, entrecote and frites.  And salad.  And wine.  And bread.  I think that's about it.  Your only choice is how you want your meat done.  Being ""un snob bourré"" I of course ordered mine blue.
Fourth impression:  my plate is empty.  Fifth impression:  my plate magically refills itself!  This is the only restaurant I've ever been in where you get the exact same meal served to you twice.  Most innovative.
The food was pretty good, and from recollection was 20 pounds or so which for London seems OK value.  Of course our bill was far more than that due to the wine I kept ordering.  Following Hemmingway's maxim ""Any man who eats dessert is not drinking enough"", I didn't have dessert so I can't vouch for that.  I did have another bottle of wine though.",1
4,Really good steak frittes!  Got there right before the rush at 6:30.,1
5,"Like all the other reviews so, this place is an obsession.  Found it by accident, was wondering why there was a line around the corner.  Great neighborhood location by the way.  We got right in on a weekday night.  Knew up front no menu. You get a green salad with a walnut dressing, steak, fries that's it.  They have wine and beer too.  The steak comes with this magical green sauce that they won't tell you because it's a secret recipe.  We devoured our steak and fries and then all of a sudden you get more steak and fries!  This place was so addicting and am so happy we have one here in NYC because I need to go back!",1
5,"Good lord, this place is amazing.  I ate here back in November and honestly it's one of the things I remember most from my brief stay in London.  I can understand why this place is a chain, there should be one in every city.  As for the details - expect to wait in line. But it is worth the wait. 
I went on a Friday night and as long as the line was, it kept moving. The food, i.e. the one thing you can eat there, is really something. Steak and fries with the ""mystery"" sauce, that's it. I say mystery because apparently it's a pretty well guarded secret.  I've found from talking with coworkers that everyone has their opinions as to what's in it.  It's a fun game to play while you eat. After you clean your plate and reflect on the great meal you just had, the waitress appears like an angel with the second helping. 
The house wine was decent and the price for the meal was well below the high quality of the food. We also tried a few of the deserts, which is crazy considering how full we were after the main course. It was worth the loosening of the belt.
Seriously recommended!",1
4,"If your in the Marylebone area, this restaurant is a must !  If u love steak & frites this is place 4 you!  Delicious ! Be prepared 2 wait ! No reservation.",1
5,"Perfect for a quick and tasty lunch, with a set menu starting with a tangy green salad, and then perfectly portioned slices of beef drenched in that yummy secret sauce that you'll crave even after being done with it, and a side of thin but flavorful french fries. There's a list of deserts you can end your meal with but I do especially recommend the crème brulé. The atmosphere can be great or dreadful depending on who you ask, being a loud, almost always crowded place can put off some but also, in the right mood, be quite fun! The lack of the ability to book before coming is unfortunate considering the queue that can go on for half an hour at times (though I didn't see one the last time I went), but you owe it to yourself to at least try that heavenly-sauce-drenched slices steak!",1
5,"Relais de Venise is a Parisian born phenomenon. Its original Paris bistro opened in 1959 by Paul Gineste de Saurs, who merely sought a place to serve his family's Château de Saurs wines. Opting for an especially short and traditional bistro menu of a simple salad (lettuce, walnuts and potent mustard vinaigrette), steak-frites with a butter-based secret recipe sauce of herbs, spices and condiments along with a few particularly moreish desserts (save room for the profiteroles!), the no nonsense bistro soon won fans for its quality over variety dining experience. It also won a reputation for its strict no reservations policy. Legend tells of married couples meeting on queue and of people securing their next job while waiting for their Frenchy meat and potatoes chow down.
 Based on my experience dining at the Marylebone Lane Relais (but without yet having the pleasure of visiting the flagship in Paris or their other London location in the City), I reckon the food's worth a bit of a wait. The flavoursome frites - made of Bintje potatoes from France that are hand chipped daily on the premises using a bespoke chipper to ensure a signature 7mm thin slice  are out of this world, and the much speculated upon but never revealed secret sauce is a most delectable accompaniment. Here in London, the bistros serve Donald Russell steaks from Aberdeenshire beef (supplier to HM The Queen) for their entrecote steak (which they'll even serve blue).
 An order of salad and main course is priced at £20 per person and yields a more than ample amount of food. Puds cost around £5. A glass of house red is £4.25. Vegetarians are welcome, and as a substitute for the steak a selection of cheeses is offered and a dessert is included for the same price of £20. Service is perfunctory and fast.",1
4,"When I've had a really bad day, I want to leave work and have a stress-free evening. This involves an easy choice of venue for dinner, reliably good food, maybe an affordable bottle of wine, and a food-induced coma putting me to sleep. For these nights, Relais delivers.
The two locations are convenient for me (The City, and Marylebone), and the food never disappoints. From the walnut salad to the expertly trimmed steak and decadent secret sauce, and just as importantly the very affordable, highly tasty house wine, it is a sure thing that always puts a smile on my face.
No reservations means the usual dilemma: (1) arrive before opening to beat the line, or (2) get in the queue and wait your turn. The line moves fast, and is expectedly shorter in the winter, so that helps, but in general, it moves very quickly. To facilitate this, though, you do give up some service during the meal, but as long as you have the right mindset going into it, that is manageable.
As for the price, at twenty pounds a head, its a little steep. But there's just nothing else like it, and when you see the demand, you can't really blame them.
Four stars for delivering on ease, food, wine, and coma. I'll be here often!",1
4,"when in Rome...or when in London really, L'Entrecote is the best place in London to get a bloody (quite literally) steak and fries.
I'm a pseudo-vegetarian ie I love meat but try to avoid it
however, I splurged a few summer's ago when I had a not-s0-fully-cooked steak here. The place has this whole old school feel, lyke all Victorian era and shizzle 
Basically you drink wine like it's ribena (its cheap) and pretend you're in France for a dinner.
yeah the sauce is real good. real saucy.",1
5,"I wanted to go to the Paris-based restaurant, but the lines were always so ridiculous that I never made it out there in the four months I spent there.
Before coming here, I had spent the day eating half the section of Borough and having cake at Selfridge's.  Since my visiting friend INSISTED on going, I took a little digestive nap (if that even exists) and dragged myself over here, still digesting the raclette and oreo cupcake from 3 hours ago. 
Oh my god I'm so glad I came. At first I kept grumbling about spending £20 on a set meal I wasn't even hungry for, but I killed this meal like it was my first in days.  You get the only choice of walnut/endive salad and choose how your meat is to be cooked.  When I received my first plate, I was a bit turned off by how small it was. But waiiiiiit, 2/3 way through I get a second plate. More meat! With some successful flirting by my friends, we get a massive dosage of fries.  The sauce is made JUST as sauce should be made in French steak de boeuf avec frites. I was so happy leaving here. SO disgustingly full, but so happy. 
It does get very busy and you may feel a little rushed at times, but who cares. Go.",1
4,"Don't you hate it when you have a favorite place that warrants 5 stars and some hater decides to say ""I don't see what all the fuss is about""....after reading the reviews of this place I decided that I must try it (even if I have to go by myself)....well the boss decides to be a great guy and take us out for dinner and where does he take us????  To his most favorite place in the whole wide world....he was like a little kid on his way to a birthday party, practically drooling on the cab ride over going on and on about how we would love this place and that it was a ""surprise""...well imagine my surprise when we got to the entrance with only 4 people in front of us.  Overall I had a fun time and enjoyed the food.",1
5,The Steak is amazing and the sauce is simply the best I have ever tasted. Went to this place a couple of days ago and I know I will be visiting again.,1
5,"deliiiiiiiicious, definitely deserves 5 stars for food, price, and venue.
i picked this restaurant for a friend's birthday and was duly praised for my awesome choice. the queue wasn't so bad (thankfully his birthday was on a Monday), maybe 20-30 minutes? then we were seated and offered a very french style salad, you know the mustard/oil/vinaigrette sauce. then asked how we wanted our steak cooked. not only do they have one choice of menu, they also only have rare, medium, and well-done. i asked for medium rare on instinct and was shot down immediately. most of us opted for medium, with one brave frenchman getting the rare. the medium was great- more or less like the medium rare that i like.. success! 
we ordered a bottle of house red on the recommendation of Ana H. that it was really decent wine, and upon approval of two frenchmen, decided it must be true (eyeroll). for dessert, we got the extremely decadent profiteroles. i got smashed for calling them cream puffs you can get at costco but i still think this part is true :P 
good food, good wine, good company, topped with cream puffs.. 5 stars!",1
5,"One of my all-time favorites. Worth the long lines. Love the food. Everytime I visit London, i have to eat here at least once.",1
5,"I meant to go to the Paris location when I was doing my internship in London but it was closed for the summer =( Luckily my friend, who had recommend the Paris location, knew there was also a London location and took me here on a date.
It's sort of hidden when I think about it since we came from Oxford Circus and had to go through all these different streets.  I remember her telling me that it was near the London Cordon Bleu Culinary School and magically remembered how to get there so that I could take my parents later when they came to visit me.
I must say that even my father an avid steak snob, only succumbing to the likes of House of Prime Rib and places of that stature, was surprised how ridiculously fantastic the steak is here.  
Each piece of steak is cooked to perfection and the 2nd and 3rd course are just steak and more frites!  If I could die and go to heaven I wish that L'Entrecote would be there.  It is worth every pound!",1
4,"This delightful steak only (yes - only steak on the menu) restaurant in Marylebone is pretty unique in London. There's always a queue outside, but when you finally arrive at the front prepare to be greeted by some stroppy French waiter/waitress ushering you to your seat and slapping a delicious salad on the table that you hadn't ordered. Let's just say the service isn't friendly here. Let's also say that they don't do medium rare or medium to well done.Let's also say they couldn't tell my coeliac mum whether or not their delicious green sauce had gluten in it as it's flown in from France and is a secret (what a load of tosh). Inspite of all this, their steak is really delicious. Served with fries (and only fries) you'll get a first helping, followed by a second one about 20 minutes later. You'll greedily chuff it down even if you are full. I've never made it to the dessert menu but I'm sure it's nice. Just don't ask the waiters for anything out of the ordinary or they might slap you.",1
5,"Great food, and experience.  You can't book so if you go for lunch its best to get there as close to 12.00 as possible otherwise expect a wait.  The deserts are as good as the steak n chips set menu so save room.  My favourite is the prailine legiones.  No, its the profiteroles.  
Beware the service is good but brutal.  Don't dither with your lunch orders and don't expect any leniency if you arrive towards closing time.  They are french after all.  Well worth a visit.",1
4,"I was surprised by this place because we just kind of hungrily ""stumbled"" in the restaurant unknowingly. But I was in for an even greater surprise because they served two of my favorite things together- steak and french fries (or what the Brits call chips.) 
This quaint restaurant situated near the ever-popular Marylebone High Street was bustling with people and servers dressed in ""french maid"" costumes. Very fitting I would say! 
The whole concept of offering only a set menu of  steak frites and a green salad with mustard vinaigrette starter was a bit weird, but I liked the whole idea of not having to fuss over a French menu where I would have trouble pronouncing every other word. I enjoyed every bit of the whole entire dining experience from start to finish. The fries were quite tasty and the steak done either well or medium satisfied my insatiable appetite.",1
4,"Fantastic spot - addictive food and underrated house wine.  By London standards, its a cheap meal out in an attractive location.  
Only knocks
1.  Agree with the reviewer comment that its billed as a one of a kind and you travel around France and see these all over the place (twice walking around Paris, once in Bordeaux).
2.    Compared to a good Paris bistro, the quality of the meat is pretty marginal.  
That said, great value for money and London needs more places like it.  Plus, I like fast service - it gets more people in the door,  ""strikeouts are boring.  Besides that they're fascist.  Throw some ground balls - its more democratic""",1
5,"What an awesome place on so many levels...
1.  They don't take reservations - Awesome... I'm such a disorganised bloke that I never really think about booking until waaay to late for nice restaurants, so a 10 minute wait outside is a small price to pay for leaving a nice dinner out with my mum to the last minute...
2.  There is no choice of mains - Awesome... My mum is sooo indecisive in restaurants that choosing from a medium sized menu can take most of the evening.  The fact that the choice is restricted to ""How do you like your steak?""  severley cut down waiting times!
3.  The place is packed - Awesome... There is a queue of people waiting to get in (I'd estimate between 10 mins to 45 mins whilst I was there), the tables are close together and the constant burble of conversation creates an ongoing ambience of people getting down to the no nonsense, serious business of stuffing themselves silly.  A proper unpretentious eating establishment.
4.  The service - Awesome... Despite the busyness of the place, the servers are attentive and quick without being obtrusive.  At no point did I feel rushed, yet every time I needed something a waitress seemed to have read my mind and was standing there with what I wanted.
5.  The wine - Awesome...  It was both super tasty (from the restaurants own vineyard) and very reasonable.
6.  The food - You've guessed it... Awesome - The dressed walnut salad to start was delicious and the perfect size to whet my appetite without making me feel as though I was going to have to start eating the table.  The perfectly cooked steak with a divine herb butter sauce and heavenly fries were each simple, but together like all great meals far more than the sum of their parts.  NOTE: remember this is French, so if you usually like your steak medium-rare, go medium, if you usually go well done (philistine), then ask for it burned....
7.  The price - Awesome... I see someone has had a bit of a whinge in one of the earlier reviews, but I reckon £20 for a two course dinner, paired with £17 fine wine (Making it around £60 for food and wine for 2) is damn fine value!
I will definitely go again, the only question is whether I have to wait until I have an excuse to take someone or whether I will just pop in on my own the next time I walk past... It may well be the second!
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!",1
5,"omg amazing. there are no words to describe. some people say it's a bit pretentious (they literally serve one thing: steak and fries) but its damn good. 
i've been here a few times, both with friends and my boyfriend. its just simply excellent. you sit down, they ask you how you want your steak cooked (rare, medium, well). they bring you a salad and french bread, and then bring your steak and fries in two waves.
a few tips:
1.) you have to get here early. it opens at 6:00pm. if you are there before 6:45pm you are fine, otherwise expect to wait in line.
2.) order the house red wine. it's good and the cheapest on the menu.
3.) for dessert, i recommend the profiteroles and creme brulee and if you want an extra treat the dessert wine is also fab.
4.) they do not take reservations so don't even try.
love love love this place.",1
4,"Novel steak frite joint built Parisian stylee... You have to wait in a queue that evaporates quickly enough.  If you're a group of two you can get in pretty quickly.  Excellent steak (but you can get better, see Goodmans or Hawksmoor), great frite and tasty side salad, feels good value for £20 and normally in and out quickly.  Highly recommended for something a bit different.  Good date place if girl/man/man/girl like meat.",1
5,"This place is pretty amazing. There's a no booking policy, but they shift people pretty quickly (it's not the place to come for a long drawn-out romantic dinner).
 But OMG the steak. They only serve steak frites, but they do it very well. Best of all? Once you've eaten your yummy dinner, the come back with a second serving. Yep, steak frites twice! I don't know why, but having steak frites twice is going to improve my evening. And I was having a pretty great time as it was.
 They do demi bottles of wine, which is a good thing - if there's two of you, you won't get chance to finish a whole bottle before they're asking for their table back.
 The profiteroles weren't great (ice cream instead of cream) but when you're paying £19 for dinner and you get STEAK TWICE, who cares about the desserts?
 Did I mention you get steak TWICE?",1
4,Great food. The sauces a the meat are definitely amazing. The single menu and the great house wine make the ordering process probably the fastest in London. The queue and the price a bit higher than the expected move it down to 4 star.,1
5,"This is a great place to have a casual lunch whilst at the same time feeling like you're doing something special. This is of course courtesy of the set menu and the tastiness of the food. Of course casual is not in the pricing, but then again, neither is steak-frites with a mystery sauce.
On the sauce: it's good, but not mind blowing; it's not that I've had better, I just don't know if that's as good as it gets.
Overall, nice ambiance, courtesy of the waitresses' uniforms and decor, and a nice place to get a special meal with family or a good friend.",1
5,"If you can't deal with a long line or only one choice on the menu, this isn't your place. 
But if you love a proper steak frites served with a perfect sauce Diane and a yummy salad, a good wine selection, and many sweets to choose from after, look no further. 
The food is impeccable and exactly what it is supposed to be. If you don't like it, then you don't get it.",1
4,"Le Relais De Venise is known for its steak, frites and walnut salad.  It's pretty simple but the special sauce is rich and decadent and you get two portions!  It's a very comforting meal.",1
5,"I have been going here for 5 years and its fantastic. If you like steak, chips and a fabulous secret sauce then this is perfect. Ok, the service is very French but overall, its a great place to go with friends, family, lovers etc. 
The house red is excellent value and the best tasting wine on the list. Fave pud is the gateaux du relais (chocolate cake 2 ways) 
Lastly, dont forget that if you want more sauce, fries or bread, they will gladly bring it to you as its all included.... if you can manage it!",1
2,"I had high expectations of this restaurant since it was highly recommended by friends who've been to the original Parisian branch (which was unfortunately under renovation when I visited one Summer).
 Alas, I was rather put off by the service (snooty, impersonal French.. it's like being in Paris all over again!) and small portions.
 If you are a steak lover, you'll find the steak decent, but nothing to rave about. My impression was more of a factory production line, where the waiter asks how you want your steak done - medium rare, medium or well done. They then serve you from a tray of pre-cooked meats, rather than prepare your food individually.
 The result can be disappointing, as the meat is at times luke warm, and the standards can vary.
 I was rather incensed that the waiter served me a very small portion of beef, and gave a much larger portion to the couple beside me. We were all paying the same price! Not only that, when we were given the choice of a 2nd (and final) helping, my portions remained small! Call it bad luck, but I was NOT impressed.
 To be fair, they made very good thin cut fries, and you could have as many servings as you desired. But I was hardly there for the fries, and had not intended to fill myself with a stomachful of oily high-caloried potatoes!
 If you're after good steak, by all means try this venue since it's received a lot of thumbs up from other patrons. But I doubt you'll leave feeling much impressed - it's one of those been there, done that experiences. I won't be going back.",-1
5,"When I first lived abroad in Paris I had a challenging time finding, in two words, good grub.  Yo France, stop drowning everything in mayonnaise and cheese. What the hell?  So after munching on baguettes for a month I found three GO-TO places in Paris: a Lebanese restaurant where no one spoke French or English, a breakfast place called Breakfast In America (#1 and #2) and L'Entrecôte. 
I just had dinner at L'Entrecôte in London and it brought back all the fantastic memories of when I used to dine at the Paris location. 
The menu is simple. Sliced steak and fries...and if you want, a second order of the same. A salad to start and wine. You don't have any real choices, which is great when you just want to eat. 
Expect a line, and it's really cramped quarters, but that's a part of the experience.  They don't rush you but expect to get mad-dogged if you try to hang out for more than an hour.",1
5,"We got there in time to beat the lunch rush and were immediately seated. The salad was OK, but the steak and fries were spot on. And just when I thought I had finished a petite European lunch, the second round of steak and fries showed up, perfectly cooked to order. 
Paired with a few nice bottles of red wine, it was the perfect Friday break for our group.",1
5,"I know the original in Paris and was excited to see that it made it across the pond. Lovely atmosphere. Great staff and the food is delicious. Definitely worth the long wait. The famous green mustard sauce tastes slightly different from the original in Paris but still very tasty. The red house wine is a lovely treat. And once you had one of those amazing desserts you know you are hooked forever.
Enjoy!!",1
5,Words alone cannot express what a joy the food is like at this place. They say when you get older food replaces sex as as the main joy of life...I now know why.....this place should have mirrors on the ceiling....  the food is that good. The price is fair and the house wine is good also.....and oh my god they give you second portions.  I only go occassionally for fear that my love of the dining here may lead to over exursion or public indecency due to over stimulation of my taste buds.,1
4,"There's no menu at this place, they don't take reservations and only seat you when all of your party are present. But I've got no problems with that, because the food is so yummy. When you sit down, you get a starter salad with walnuts and some bread. Once that's done, you'll be served steak with some amazing sauce and seriously yummy fries. My favourite part is when they come back for a second round and give you more steak and slather it with more sauce. My kind of heaven. Dessert is where you can pick what you want, traditional French desserts like creme brulee, profiteroles or sorbet. I went with the Vacherin, a towering mound of meringue, ice-cream and chocolate sauce. You get lots of jealous looks too.
 Prices are fairly reasonable - all up I paid about £30 (includes 1 glass of wine and dessert). This place makes me a really happy bunny - I couldn't stop grinning like an idiot throughout the meal. Sooo going again.",1
4,"I came by myself for dinner! That's correct, you read that right.  All by myself while everyone else in line waiting outside for a seat were either in pairs or a group. Pft - yea it's awkward at first but you start to not care after a while. Plus I found this place through yelp..gotta try what my fellow yelpers recommended. It was pretty good..not sure what they hype is though. The salad was GOOD...very interesting wasabi vinegarette..i likey. So not much else to say, set menu for 20 GBP - salad, steak and fries (2 servings), dessert will cost u more than the set 20 GBP, but none of them were more than 5 GBP.  (I had good creme bruelee - perfect for one). The half bottle wine that I bought...not sure it's what everyone says it is..it's ALRIGHT..but not great for 9 GBP. meah.
Hey..my first London review! yes!!",1
4,"Awesome and different. It loses one star for only letting you choose Rare, Medium and Well. No medium-well etc. But the desserts are to die for and it's a very unusual experience. Highly recommended.",1
5,Wonderful.  Delicious steak frites and a green salad with a mustard vinaigrette are basically your only choice.  Service is business-like but not unfriendly.  It's an appealing setting and great food.  Well worth a visit!,1
3,"Original (no menu), good (decent meat in London), exotic (French), the deal is clear and most people will like it.
 If I may say:
 - £20 for steak should include a glass of wine. If they dwelve on their French style, the wine is missing.
 - it's not the best steak you can eat. Come on, guys, are you American or what ? It's good, not exceptional.
 - on Friday and Saturday evenings, there is a queue outside. It can take you more than half an hour to get in...
 Don't go there with your girlfriend, but with your mates :-)",-1
3,"Having looked at many of the reviews I felt an urge to put fingers to keyboard. I lived in Marylebone for sometime and was always very surprised by the ques of people waiting to eat here. If you are a steak fan and looking for great meat this is not the place to go. The meat is ok, covered in a ""secret"" special source that I managed to knock up my kitchen 2 days later to as near as perfect. The service is ok, but they are a high volume restaurant, dont expect to stay to long! They do, what they do, very, very well but I still dont understand the endless Ques! What is more surprising is that directly opposite you have what is widely regarded as the best fish and chip restaurant in London, the Gun hidden behind the high street and the Autre Pied 2 mins away, which in my book knock spots of this place.... Oh and its not that im ignoring the providores its just that if you dont want to Que for dinner then I wouldnt go (sunday breakfast used to amazing, then the papers ran an article on it and you now Que for hour to get)... Start at the Prince Regent and have great night in my old manor!",-1
4,"This place has the same business model as a restaurant in Geneva - Le Relais de l'Entrecote - and it seems just as popular. We went on Tuesday night this week and as the desciption says all they do is walnut green salad to start and then steak and frites for the main course. Its superb, served in two portions for £19. When we left they were q'ing out of the door.",1
2,Average. 2 hour wait for small sliced up steak! I'm a South African and I know my meat....I wont be going back for it. Way too expensive.,-1
5,"You cannot find better steak than at this restaurant. Although slightly pricey at just under £20 per head for a meal (not including drinks), it is well worth a visit or two or three! The staff are extremely efficient, sometimes friendly, sometimes not, but that doesn't matter when your meal arrives. There is no choice about what you eat. You start with an amazing green salad, followed by steak, chips and sauce, followed by seconds of steak. There is however a choice of puddings, all equally delicious. This has to be one of my favourite restaurants in London.",1
5,"First you get a salad, then the only thing you tell the waiters is how you wish your steak to be cooked you are then presented with half of your steak and when you finish that your waiter brings the rest of it, this is complimented with chips and their authentic steak sauce. A beautiful restaurant right in the heart of marylebone village and a must for steak lovers!",1
5,"A very unique experience and food! No real menu, No reservations and only able to to be seated once all the party is present! You may think it will be a mistake visiting this restaurant, however, I can assure you the opposite is true!! You start with a decent Walnut salad but what really makes the visit more than worth while, is the Steak which is cooked in an amazing sauce, along with the best pom frites you can get anywhere in London! I promise, you will be licking your fingers afterwards!! They also have very tasty dessert list (alebit a small one) to finish of the evening with. This restaurant is simply the most addictive restaurant I have been to in London and there are only 4 of them worldwide, including Paris, New York and Dubai. I have also been to the one in Paris and it is exactly the same in terms of food testiness and set up! Cannot recommend highly enough!",1
5,"This place is cute and delicious!! I came with my boyfriend and we each had a bowl of ramen as well as the fried chicken to share. It was all yummy.
The service was relatively quick and the ambiance is casual and fun :)
One of my favorite meals while I was traveling!",1
5,"One of the best ramen I've ever had. It beats a lot of the ramen places I've been to in New York. The spicy yozu ramen is SO GOOD. The noodles were the perfect texture and the soup didn't taste like it was full of MSG. When I went the line was crazy long, but there's a reason why people wait that long to get in. Honestly if I had to wait that long on line again I would. Wish I could've gone back at least one more time before leaving London.",1
3,"Dubbed one of London's top ramen shops, I can only think of one word to describe Kanada-Ya: underwhelming. 
Perhaps it is London's pre-eminent ramen shop with lines flying out the door. Across, you'll find Ippudo, a world-renowned ramen chain that has hours-long waits in its NYC shops, sitting slightly emptier. Has Kanada-Ya taken the throne away from them in London? Maybe.
I waited about 15 minutes on a Tuesday night. It is a very small, quaint corner restaurant that can fit less than 40 people. As I was approaching the from across the street, I could already smell the heavy truffle aroma from their popular Truffle Ramen from the swinging door. The patrons leaving, too, smelled like truffles as they dashed past me. Being a truffle fanatic, I was so pumped for the Truffle Ramen.
I'm no ramen expert but this was far from the best ramen I've ever had. You might like this if you like light broths, but it's not creamy at all. The truffle oil felt more like it was there for the smell, and maybe some flavor. The pork was a bit on the dry side and took me awhile to get through. For the most expensive ramen on the menu (£14), I wish they'd included a Hanjuku egg or something because it felt...plain. Kanada-Ya is definitely overhyped. I can't speak for Ippudo in London, but I try to avoid it altogether like a plague since it's overhyped in NYC. London doesn't seem to have a very competitive ramen scene and that's sorta sad, given how many trendy Japanese restaurants there are in the area, I might as well have just gone to Japan Centre.",-1
3,"It's kinda sad if this is the best ramen that London has to offer. I got their classic Tonkotsu X which was very very plain. The noodles were too thin and the broth didn't quite any punch. I should've ordered an egg to go with it, but the side black garlic sauce was a good choice.",-1
4,"I gotta say. I was kind of disappointed with the ramen here. Maybe it's my picky New York tongue, but I expected better out of supposedly London's best ramen restaurant.
I got the Tonkotsu and the char siu don. The Tonkotsu broth was good. It salt level wasn't too high, and it certainly packed a punch! However, the noodles certainly let the meal down. It lacked that special pizzaz that great ramen-yas have. 
The two redeeming factors were the meat and the char siu don. The meat was absolutely amazing; so soft like I was eating clouds. It was juicy and OMG my mouth is now watering just thinking about it. The char siu don (using the same meat) was equally as good. 
As weird as this sounds, if I go back in the future, it would definitely be to just crush three of those char siu dons.",1
5,"Great place to grab ramen on a cold evening, but not a place to go if you're in a rush, because of the wait. Once you're in the door, everything is quick to come and fresh! I had the spicy yuzu ramen and some karaage japanese fried chicken. Big portions, so I couldn't eat it all. Both were awesome! I would definitely come back.",1
4,"From the reviews, best ramen in London. Not surprised as it was quite good. First off, it is a small place and they don't take reservations. Be prepared to wait in line (no wait list to sign up). There's a bench outside and they provide small cups of tea sometimes while you wait. The turnover is quite fast so don't be too intimated by the amount of people. 
The food comes out ridiculously fast. I got the only in London ramen and my husband got the truffle. The ramen is pretty bare bones in terms of toppings. If you want anything like an egg or garlic oil it's extra. You can pick your noodle toughness which is nice. Portion is just right so you can order something else. The broth is really thick and flavorful. I personally enjoyed the charsu and I normally don't.  
Karaage was pretty good. 4 pounds for three decent sized pieces. Nice crispy outside and good sauce. 
Not the best I've had but it was pretty good. If I was a local I would come back but not often given how expensive it is.",1
5,"Great ramen option in London. We were swayed by seeing the line when we were initially planning to go to Ippudo across the street. The line moves pretty fast. Be ready with what you want to order before you get inside. You could always grab a beer at the convenience store next store and have it while you wait. 
Ordered the spicy yuzu which actually had a good amount of heat with the soft boiled egg which you must add to any ramen you get. I would even budget more stomach room for more eggs! Also ordered the chasu with garlic oil and egg. Both were amazing with hard noodles. The noodles are thinner than most ramen places. The chicken katsu was the perfect amount of salty and crunchy. Definitely filled my ramen craving. Also pretty large portions so be sure to budget stomach room.",1
3,"Nothing special, and I still needed to wait in line for 30 minutes.
I hail from San Francisco where we have a very competitive ramen scene. After eating at Kanada-Ya, I have to say that if this is the best that London has to offer, I feel really bad for people who live in London. 
I decided to come to Kanada-Ya at the last moment, so when I got there about 15 minutes after they opened, there was already a line of about 20 people waiting to get inside. I waited about 20-25 minutes and was allowed inside. Because we were given menus while waiting in line, before I even sat down, I placed an order for the tonkatsu X ramen with noodles cooked hard, umeboshi onigiri and the chicken karaage. I figured that if I was only to come once, I was going to order everything I wanted to try. 
The food came out relatively quickly. The chicken karaage came out first and was the highlight of the meal (that's sad considering that the ramen is supposed to be the highlight). It was crispy, very well seasoned, and the dipping mayo was very good. I highly recommend you order this when you are here. It was a reasonable portion for the price. 
The ramen came next. I prefer the thicker ramen noodles, and these were the thin kind. The broth didn't taste very special. They claim that this broth takes a really long time to develop, etc., but it really doesn't taste like 20 hour (or however long) broth. There were no complex flavors that you would come to expect from a broth that took so long to make. The char siu was pretty good, but when I eat ramen, I expect the broth to be the highlight. 
I don't recommend the umeboshi onigiri. I grew up eating umeboshi and they give you the large, cheap, sour kind, not the expensive honey somewhat sweet and sour kind of umeboshi. Sure they were big, but definitely not worth the price. But honestly, what did I expect from a place that specializes in ramen.
If there is a line for this joint, I recommend going to the Ippudo across the street with no line. There is no reason for you to stand outside in the freezing cold (if it's winter) for 20-30 minutes to eat a bowl of subpar ramen. My friend did try this place out before me, and suggested I not go because this was nothing special, but I didn't listen to him because I just love ramen.",-1
5,Great ramen with a decadent and rich tonkatsu broth. Noodles were also al dente and perfect amount of tender chasu pork. Only issue was the lack of air conditioning! Slurping ramen in a 80 degree room was not fun hahhaha,1
4,"After living in the Netherlands for a few months, I was craving ramen like no other. I tried to get it in Switzerland (major mistake, their ramen was from the instant ramen packages from the supermarket) and then tried it again in the Netherlands for brunch (also mistake, the noodles were soggy and the broth/meat had no flavor). So when we were going to London for a weekend, I decided that ramen would be our first meal. 
Kanada-Ya doesn't take reservations, so we got there around 7:45 and there were about 6 people waiting outside the store. We got seated in about 20 minutes which was much better than I expected. I got the truffle ramen and my boyfriend got the Tonkotsu-X, and we split a chicken karaage. This was too much food for the both of us but I really liked the chicken (not overly fried or oily). My ramen was good, but not amazing. I love truffle but I actually didn't really like it in my ramen, but the Tonkotsu-X was great. The ramen also doesn't come with an egg so make sure to add one if you want! They recommend you get the hard noodles which were perfect to me. 
Overall, great ramen spot in London.",1
4,"Quite a delicious ramen place. From the reviews, I guess this must be one of the best ramen houses in London. I've been to ramen places around the world from Tokyo to San Francisco, Kanada-Ya is probably somewhere in the middle on my list of great ramen places (still pretty good!)
The seating inside is quite tight but that's pretty typical of ramen places. The broth they use is a classic and you can tell that they brew it for over 10 hours with pork. I absolutely love this style of heavy broth, it gives the ramen a richness that is quite unique compared to other styles of noodles. The chasu is decent but nothing that floored me.
All in all, a decent place for a bowl noodles. It is quite expensive but that's expected in the heart of London. If you need ramen in London, this is probably the place to be (as evidenced by the rave reviews and long lines).",1
4,Possibly best you can have in London. Qualified evwn for Japanese. However please surely come to Tokyo for much better ones. Forget Ichiran or Ippudo,1
4,"Very good ramen and queuing is worth it, doesn't take too long anyways. Chose the Tonkatsu with black garlic oil, which had to pay extra for. 
Also had the chicken karaage, which was very crunchy on the outside and chicken was moist. Highly recommend! 
Overall delicious taste. I would've given it five stars but only four stars as had to pay extra for the black garlic oil as well as a portion of the eggs on my bowl of ramen. I would go back, but not quite in a hurry.",1
5,Amazing ramen but you will end up waiting a long time if you arrive at peak hours. Service is also great and friendly and I would agree with other comments that probably best ramen in London . We are now regulars here and have learned when to be there to avoid the queue,1
5,"Kanadaya does the best ramen in the UK! Try avoid 1-2pm or 7-8.30pm slot as you will most likely be queuing for their seats. Early lunch like 12.30pm or early dinner at around 6.30pm are always good time slots with no queues. 
Even though their speciality is added truffle oil, I find the truffle oil smell a bit too thick and strong in noodle soup or with the edamame beans. My favourite dish is their Tonkatsu x with 'hard' noodles (yes, you can customise your noodle!). No matter how many times I dine at Kanadaya, I can't get enough of their noodles and I will always be back!",1
5,"The Ramen here is simply amazing, the best I've had. I tried both the spicy options at different times, and they both have a good level of spice, while maintaining great flavor.",1
5,"Hi. We really liked this little place. There was a fast seating line - true to ramen houses.  We all had different ramens and I loved my chashu ramen. We also got a side dish of chashudon and the rice under the meat was so good.  
I think everyone wants to go back.  So far we've tried a dumpling house, fast Japanese food and Indian in London and surprisingly it was not good.  
So glad we found this little chain",1
3,"The broth is kinda light, and mixed with noodle's smell. Go there 5 minutes before they open and avoid lining up.
Unfortunately, I can't finish their ramen because the strange taste of the broth.",-1
5,"The spicy yuzu ramen was so delicious I had a dream about after eating it. The spicy, savory, tangy flavor was insane. Loved every bite of it! This is my new favorite ramen spot!!",1
2,"Cute little ramen shop on the corner of St. Giles High Street.
Can only speak to the experience of making a light and early lunch out of a few side dishes, the chicken karaage (small portion for £4) and the truffle edamame (large portion for £4). I went there with the intent of having a nice bowl of ramen, but they were out of char siu, which doesn't make much sense for a ramen house since char siu is such an integral part of the dish in general. Every single one of their bowls contains char siu, and the Yelp photos suggest hearty portions, and to not have it available is like saying they're out of ramen broth or noodles, hence my reasoning for just ordering a few sides at that time.
When time came to pay the bill, I was told by the staff that if I want to ever dine there again, I have to order ramen. Okay, that makes sense, and I came with the intent of having ramen but decided against it since I would be paying full-price for a meal that lacked an integral part of its essence: the thick slices of char siu. So it was a little off-putting to be blatantly told this. 
Next time, I'll probably opt for a different ramen joint in the area with better prepared karaage and one that would have char siu in stock.",-1
4,"Pretty authentic Kyushu Tonkotsu Ramen, definitely one of the best in London. The broth could be heaven for some and too thick for others.
I've been here for many many times so you know how good it is.",1
5,"Yes!  Finally, I have found it after eating hundreds of ramen.  The best ramen in London!  This establishment has only tables for about 24 people.  I suggest coming here early to ensure you are the first 24 go get in the door first.  If not, you will need to wait for one (or more if in a group) to finish the first round before the line starts moving.  The queue here is definitely long especially on a weekend.  I arrived 20 minutes before it opened and there were already at least 20 people queuing.  When it was time to open, I guesstimated that there were about at least 60 people waiting in line.  You definitely need to come early or you will have to wait in line.  
This place is a no fuss, quick and efficient place with a quick turnaround like a pure ramen bar in Japan.  The menu is also very short so you will already know what you want by the time you sit down.  I suggest when you sit down, order straight away.  They expect you to eat and leave so best not to hang around too long.  I got in alone bang on at 12noon and out 20 minutes after.  That's how quick it was.  
The noodles was cooked to your liking and this is what I love about this place.  I suggest the extra hard noodle so it is 'al dente'.  A lot of other ramen place has the noodles cooked too long and soft which is not what I like.  The broth is simply the best in the city and it leaves you wanting more.  Rich, creamy, smooth and so much flavour.  Do not bother with the sides as they are not worth it.  Just go straight for the ramen.  Make sure you get the mayu and marinated eggs together with your ramen.  Oh the eggs, so good and I usually have 2 of them instead of one.
The ramen here is definitely worth the wait for no doubt.",1
5,"This place specializes. Pork ramen is their thing. The menu is basically 1 pg, and that's for the best, because what they do, they do very well. Come here if you love ramen, pork, and dedication to craft. Don't come here if you give a shit about fancy decorations. Was hot and steamy inside like a bowl of ramen. The front window looks out onto a much fancier, much more expensive Japanese restaurant called Ippudo. Pretty sure this is the way to go though. Compliments to the chef.",1
4,"Good ramen. Nice portion size and filling. But not sure if it merits the 30 CAD price tag per bowl. Service is friendly enough. 
No reservations. But there are benches outside. 
Repeat: Perhaps.",1
5,"I love the Truffle Ramen.  My second trip to London this year and I had to order this dish again!  I would say they have my favorite broth.  However, I wish they can do soft boiled Instead of hard boiled egg. My son got the spicy Gekikara ramen, which he also thoroughly enjoyed. The chicken karaage was also excellent.",1
5,"Hands down, best ramen in London. Better than ippudo or shoryu. The broth is the real deal. Love the thin ramen noodles. The different flavors you get with tonkotsu x, yuzu and gekikara broths are so satisfying in their own ways. Tonkotsu x has a nice creamy taste and not too rich like some other places. I was able to finish the broth. Yuzu has that extra kick in it with a slight citrus (note: not lemon or lime.) More of a tart, pepper zesty taste. It cuts through the richness of the tonkotsu broth. Perfect for me. My fiancé had the gekikara and wow. The minced beef adds a deeper taste of beef to the broth. I think I have to get it the next time I go. 
I was able to come here twice on my trip. First time I had tonkotsu x and fiancé had yuzu. Second time I had yuzu and he had gekikara. Next time I'll have gekikara and he will have..??? :) probably spicy miso!  
Also I'm usually not a fan of chicken karaage. Actually I don't like it at all. BUT I tried it and it is better than most other ones I've tried. Not oily and very crunchy. Their onigiri also comes out hot! Very homey in the winter time.",1
5,"Ok so im a Japanese ramen aficionado. In California I have been to all the top Japanese ramen spots.. This by far is the best i've had. Put it this way Ippudo is right across the street and I did not go there. Why? Because a line started to form before they opened so I walked over and started speaking to the locals and they said by far Kanada-Ya was better and I have to agree. This broth is so rich.. The broth is simmered with pork bones for 18 hours and you can really tell. 
I ordered the classic and just added eggs which were perfectly cooked, you know what im talking about, that dark yellow runny yolk in the center mmmm. It was perfect for the chilly 40 degree weather in London. Im a westerner I use fahrenheit so excuse me lol. I also got a side of spicy miso and added a little to spice it up! 
Kanada-Ya you guys know how to cook up a bowl of delicious, comforting ramen! Definitely recommend!!!",1
4,"The place is very small and everyone is a bit crumbled inside, plus, there is usually a waiting time. But the food absolutely makes it up. Amazing ramen and fried chicken. 
Service is fine, could be much better. A really good non expensive option for ramen.",1
4,"I had the fried chicken which was just OK - not something I'd order again. The Spicy Yuzu Ramen on the other hand, was INSANE! So freakin' good. Spicy, with citrus and a buttery lobster-like broth. I ordered the egg add-on which was good, but not a game changer. The odd thing about this place is that they don't have takeaway containers that you can carry leftover ramen home in, so skip the appetizer and come hungry so you can eat every last bit of your ramen. This is a must-return spot.",1
5,"The Good:
  :: it's a local business!
  :: this place is the real deal. you see tons of asians eating here, and we all know that is instant street cred. :D
  :: they have a simple menu and they do those few items really really well
  :: their ramen is LEGIT. the broth is rich, the noodles are cooked to your preference (soft, normal and firm), the fixins in the meal are tasty and fresh...everything tastes DELICIOUS.
  :: the karaage (japanese fried chicken)...so so so so good
  :: service is friendly
  :: clean and bright inside
The Bad:
  :: it can get CROOOOWDED bc everyone loves this place. prepare to wait in line outside, which can suck if it's really really cold out or if it's raining out. but remain steady bc the wait is worth it!!!!
  :: very small...not good for crowds at all. think you or you and another person, that's it.
The Ugly:
  :: none
Would I go back? A thousand times yes!!!! For an authentic ramen house, you won't go wrong here, I promise.
This place is IN.",1
5,"I love Ramen. Whenever I have the opportunity to try out a new ramen spot, I go for it, so naturally, I couldn't just leave this one out. Having read a lot about this restaurant I wasn't sure what to expect and whether it would be the real deal or just a massively overhyped tourist-trap. Now that I've been there, I do believe the hype.
The first thing that caught my attention was the line in front of the restaurant, which is perfectly normal in Japan but rare to come across in the West. Like in Japan, you are handed the menu in advance so you can already decide on what you want before getting a seat as the line moves rather quickly. We opted for a classic Tonkotsu Ramen, a spicy Yuzu Tonkotsu and some Karaage (fried chicken) as a side.
I wasn't sure what to expect from the Yuzu Tonkotsu but it was absolutely delicious. The acidity added by the Yuzu was just right, combined with a hint of spiciness it nicely balanced out the fatty broth, adding a little freshness to an otherwise hearty and earthy dish. While the soups were stellar, what really stole the show was the Karaage. Coming with Yuzu-flavored mayo and a slightly spicy batter, the fried chicken was modeled after the flavor profile of the spicy Tonkotsu, which worked great. The meat was super juicy, and perfectly cooked through while the spices didn't distract too much from the chicken itself. Probably the best fried chicken I've had in my life.
If you like Ramen and you're in London, I'd highly recommend giving this one a try.",1
4,"Super tiny ramen shop located right across the street from Ippudo and likely to have a queue during peak lunch and dinner hours. I came here at 1:30-2:00 pm on a weekday by myself and didn't have to wait which was awesome.
It's easy to make a decision on what to order since they don't have a very extensive menu. They make a few things very well. They serve some karage, some other appetizers, and 4-5 types of ramen. I got the Tonkatsu ramen, added some spicy miso paste (which came in a spoon so you could control how much you wanted to add), and added an egg. I like that you can specify the texture of the noodles (hard, medium, or soft).
The broth was rich and flavorful, and the noodles were perfectly al dente, and it was certainly one of the better bowls of ramen that I've had. But having just eaten at Ippudo in NY the week before, I just preferred Ippudo a touch more. I'd wait for this ramen again for ~30 min, but not sure I'd wait 1+ hour for this. Perfect for a grey, cold, blustery day. My total for the ramen, spicy miso paste, and egg was £16 so it's not exactly cheap, and it seemed to be smaller than the Ippudo NY ramen I had.
Come solo or with only one other person, and be prepared to eat communally at the bar or a long table. The space is small and fits only ~30 people, so if you have a party of 4+, go elsewhere!",1
4,I'd say it feels like a typical Japanese ramen place. Ordered the Tonkotsu X and the noodles tasted okay (pretty thin noodles) and the broth was pretty good.,1
5,"I thought the ramen here was well worth the wait (approx 30 minutes during dinner time)! I had pretty high expectations for this place, as it came highly recommended, and it didn't disappoint. I had the tonkotsu x, and my friend had the spicy yuzu. Both were great. Quite a small space, so don't expect much wiggle room.",1
4,"We continued our venture of Ramen in central London and we went to their original branch.
The menu is as small as the restaurant, with a choice of only 4 types of ramen. As we went as a party of 4, we got to order all of them to try.
Original Ramen (£10.50) - The Original Ramen at Kanada-Ya forms the basis to all their ramens and what you see is what you get! A generous portion of ramen noodles served with an 18-hour pork bone broth, topped with slices of chashu pork belly, wood ear fungus, nori (seaweed) and spring onion. The menu also says there's a secret sauce in this, not sure what it was, but it definitely tasted great! The broth was intense and full of flavour. The slices of chashu pork were melt-in-your-mouth tender. All the different toppings not only made the bowl of ramen pretty, they also added to the overall flavour and texture. If you like the simple things in life, then you won't go wrong with this Original!
Moyashi Ramen (£11.50) - the Original Ramen, topped with steamed beansprouts. This is one for those of you that like a bit of veg in your ramen. The steamed beansprouts were just cooked, so they still had a bit of crunch to them.
Chashu-Men (£13.00) - the Original Ramen, but instead of the pork belly slices, you get massive pork collar slices. The pork collar had just the right amount of fat, evenly distributed across the meat. Which means it was super tender, but also had a bit of bite to it.
Gekikara Ramen (£13.00) - Served with spicy 'tan tan' style minced pork and pork belly chashu. This is perfect for those that like a bit of a kick in their ramen. As you can see, it's pork mince, with pork belly slices, in a pork bone broth. So this is pretty porky! The spiciness isn't too overpowering, so you can still taste all the different levels of flavours from the ramen.
We also had a side dish of Karaage (£6.50) - which were deep fried chunks of chicken, served with creamy Japanese mayonnaise. These were super crispy and moist. The seasoning was in the coating and on the chicken itself. So we could tell they were freshly cooked for us. Extremely yummy and a must try if you come to Kanada-Ya. We think they would've tasted even better if they were spicy tough.
Although the ramen was nice, the broth could've been more intense. We also felt that the ramen needed the additional toppings of the pickles, garlic and sesame to really bring it to life.",1
5,"THE BEST RAMEN IN ALL OF LONDON! 
Sorry for the capitals, but it's true! You won't find a better Tonkotsu Ramen in London than the selection you'll find here. I found myself as a bit of a ramen fanatic this passed year... Trying all the varying ramens in London (I have a lot under my list now!).
I almost always for go the Tonkotsu or Chashu Men Ramen. The Chashu comes with more pork than the Tonkotsu, but is slightly more expensive. The taste of both as fantastic. Always get Hanjuku Egg to accompany your ramen, the way Kanada-Ya boils these eggs is amazing.
To accompany this incredibly tasty ramen I always have a Calipis to drink, and Salmon Onigiri and Karaage as sides. 
Seriously, there is no better ramen in London. You MUST come here.",1
5,"Tonkotsu ramen X is quite like what I've had in East Asia. All in all, good place to enjoy some delicious ramen.",1
5,"After 2 Museum walks, We were looking something different, We saw Ramen and walk to this small place to give it a shot, Well is really good, We ate Tonkotsu and was deliciuos. Packed with flavor, I add the spice red sauce and then it really came to life.",1
5,"We originally wanted to visit Ippudo that was across the street. But after talking to my friend who lives in London, we decided to visit Kanada-Ya, as she said was much better. I'm very glad we did! We came on a weekday evening at 8PM, and there was still a wait outside. The place isn't huge but they utilized the space very well to maximize the number of people they can seat. We got an order of karaage to share, along with a bowl of ramen for each. They also serve onigiri, but it would've been too much food for us. I told my boyfriend that the ramen was comparable to the ones we had in Japan. And afterwards, I found that they actually do have stores in Japan! Anyways, super solid ramen place. If you're in London and want some authentic ramen, this is the spot!",1
5,"Hands down, one of the best ramen eggs I have ever had in my life. The yolk had a great consistency, not too runny, not overcooked.The ramen they serve are the thinner ones, so if you're a fan of thicker chewy ramen, you might not like this place. I had their Chashu ramen, and it came with 4 slices of chashu which was great. Overall, I have absolutely no complains about this place. Although the queue gets rather long during peak hours, I think it was worth the wait.",1
4,"Good ramen - excellent ingredients, fresh condiments (esp. freshly grated garlic when we went) which you can add as you wish, and they master their yolky eggs to perfection. We found that the broth maybe lacked a little bit of flavor - but that's probably because we are used to more soja-y or miso-y flavors in France (and most ramen shops propose different broth flavors, which you choose from when ordering your ramen). 
Note that it is a bit expensive: £10.50 for the most basic version, £13 for the version with more pork of better quality, £2 for an egg, plus 10% service charge - free tap water though.",1
5,"If Yelp would let us post just one word, then that is what I would do....scrumptious!  I have tried other Ramen spots in London, and no one can compare to Kanada-Ya (all their locations).  The flavor of their broth, their perfect noodles (my entire family prefers the hard noodle), the sauces, fried chicken, beer...all amazingly tastey.  We have tried every one of their ramen offerings and not one of them disappointed.  Typing this now I am actually salivating...I just may have to run over there for lunch today.",1
4,"I finally built up the patience to get in the Que for this place.... For over a year now I've had my eye on it waiting for the hype to die down and a chance to have the famous ramen without the infamous pre-que!.. but today I realised it was never going to happen and I'd have to que like the rest of the world. In fairness it wasn't that long a wait (maybe 20mins)
Once inside you see the reason for the line.... It's really small. Comfortable but small. To maximise the seating, you will probably have to share a table. If your a group of 3-4 be prepared for a longer wait and bigger groups..... At your own peril!!!
The Ramen... This is what it's all about! The standard product is as good as the reviews make it out great broth, good noodles (choose how they are cooked) and great additional ingredients. Make sure you read what comes as standard though as I didn't and it meant I missed out on the egg (in most other places this comes as standard) I couldn't be bothered to order it after the ramen arrived . Btw, it comes out quick!! We also had a side of carage chicken, not the best but ok.
The service is economicical, but you won't be in there long enough to have any complaints... You may line up longer than you spend inside. They also also add 10% service on to the bill.
The food is good, the place is nice and the price is reasonable in comparison.... But damn, I hate quing!",1
5,"Delicious ramen. Nothing fancy, just amazing ingredients prepared well. Dropped by after a long day and a big bowl and cold beer perfectly hit the spot.",1
5,Spicy uzu ramen was amazing! Truffle is a little overwhelming for the pork broth.  I prefer the OG pork broth.  Our favorite ramen spot in London.,1
4,"Oooh I do like it when a ramen-plan comes together!!
Kanada-Ya has been advertising in Japanese newspapers for aaages, so I had the soft opening on my calendar for weeks (and my colleagues and I have been drooling at their twitter feed's pictures of perfect Tonkotsu and eggs...) Today was the soft opening, and although it wasn't perfect, it was still pretty damn good.
The Goooooood:
- The soup is rich, thick Tonkotsu and is really, really tasty. I thought this was one of the best Tonkotsu soups I've tried in London. 
- The spicy miso paste was also good. One portion was enough to spice up both of our bowls. Seriously yum.
- You can add extra noodles if you run out and are still hungry.
- The service was really friendly and sweet, despite the madness of people queuing around the block.
The saaaaad:
- Tonkotsu was the only option today. I'm not sure if they'll add more broths later, if not, don't bring veggy friends or non-pork-eating friends.
- Even though there was only one broth on the menu they ran out of looooads of options. I was planning to have an egg and the black garlic sauce, but they ran out before 7pm. Boo.
- They gave us the option of hard or soft ramen. We chose hard, but our ramen were pretty normal (not particularly al dente.) They weren't bad, but they weren't ""hard"". 
- Hopefully they'll improve the ordering system, as we had to ask for our spicy miso twice, and it took aaages for drinks to appear. We'd finished half our ramen before drinks and miso arrived. Doh!
I think I'll have to come back once they have opened properly to see if it gets even better. For now (as the soup was sooooo good) I'd give them 4 stars for flavour and 2 stars for service.
* It's 50% off during the soft opening, so do go and try it!
* Get there early before they run out of everything!!",1
5,"We've been dying to try Kanada-Ya, but wasn't about to wait in a queue.  We decided to give Monday at 2:15 PM a try and we were lucky to beat the lunch rush and walk right in!
Food: We both ordered the original ramen (one order with egg) with our noodles ""regular"".  They ask you how you would like your noodles cooked which is awesome.  We added two original onigiris as well to our order.  The ramen broth was so flavourful and just down right delicious with the perfect noodles.  The onigiris were simple and perfect.
Drinks: We ordered one diet coke and one Japanese lemonade which is their version of sprite.
Price: 29.40 GBP for two people.
Ambiance: The restaurant is very small, but bright and cosy in a good way.   
Service: The service was efficient and very friendly.
Would I go back?  Definitely!  This is my new favourite ramen house in London.  Sorry Bone Daddies and Shoryu, there's a new kid in town.",1
5,This is the absolute best ramen I've ever had by far.  The broth is so rich - full of flavor alone. I always ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and add black garlic oil and an extra egg. I'm a huge ramen lover and I've never had a tamago (seasoned egg) as good as Kanada-Ya's. The noodles are firm just how they should be and the pork is very tender. I sometimes get Karaage (fried chicken) as a side and the Elderflower drink as my beverage. The chicken is so juicy and is perfectly seasoned. I'm from California and wish I could go back to London just to eat here again!,1
3,"So... Most people will rate Kanada-Ya with 5 stars.
I would too. I honestly think this was the best ramen I had since I was in Japan. Better than my favourite Bone Daddies.
So why am I giving it 3 stars?
Well, when you go to Wagamama (yes yes it's a chain but it's a consistent and popular one) you get options for different meat in the ramen, and vegetarian options and such.
When you go to Bone Daddie's you also get these options, and you also have gluten free noodles if you so desire or require.
When you go to Kanada-Ya you spend ages queuing but all you can have is pork ramen. There isn't even a vegetarian option. Now this doesn't hugely bother me, but it does mean that I simply cannot go to this place when I am with a significant proportion of my friends who do not eat pork.
The friend who introduced me to this place told me that ramen is only supposed to come in pork varieties. But I guess she hasn't actually been to Japan, or she'd know this just isn't true.
So yeah, if you want a pork based Ramen, you cannot beat this place. It is awesome. But if you don't want pork, go somewhere else. I recommend Bone Daddies.",-1
4,"One of my favourite ramen place in London! What can I say about the ramen... AMAZING! The broth.. AMAZINGLY GOOD! Can I also add that the broth was properly done?! Not one of those lousy broth where you get watered down nonsense soup made with stock cubes -roll eyes-. The broth made in kanada-ya is made from proper pork bones and meat! Took away one star for long waiting time and the slightly expensive price tag for a bowl of ramen (but still so worth it, but what can I say, I'm not that rich!) 
Kanada-Ya, it's about time you renovate and expand your eatery? Yes please?! Kanada-Ya, you should, you really should.",1
5,"There are a few things I am obsessed about, and Ramen is definitely one of them. 
I have been obsessed with Tonkotsu ramen since trying it at Bone Daddies 2 years ago, and fed off it in Japan last year. 
And truthfully, the battle for best Tonkotsu in London is VERY TIGHT between Bone Daddies and Kanada-ya - and based on my latest experience with both... I'm leaning more towards Kanada-ya. YES, yes. It was THAT good. 
The problem with the West End is that the cool and funky places are booked up like crazy, so it's always a challenge having an impromptu meal before enjoying a good show.
Don't let yourself be put off by the queue in front of Kanada-ya - and expect one, there will always be one. The venue is tiny, but the the turnaround is pretty quick and you won't have to wait too long (plus, as I said: worth it) 
As I mentioned, the venue is tiny and built in typical Japanese fashion. It's not made for you to come and spend hours with friends chatting, it's made for you to come, sit your bum and eat delicious ramen. The menu is very short, meaning you get served amazing food in a record time. 
Don't be too shy, you'll probably be sitting on a communal table with other people enjoying their deliciousness. 
And now the food. For those I've lost, Tonkotsu is a creamy pork broth based ramen. And broth is what makes the ramen. And that brother was out of this world. I added the garlic sauce as an extra (which really worked) and extra egg - soft boiled eggs are a classic, you can't have a ramen without one. Trust me. 
Price-wise, perfect value. You will be paying less than £15 per person for a meal and drink. 
Soo... What are you waiting for? (Also, please let me come with you?)",1
5,"Best ramen in London. Period. Pork with a side of pork with added pork and a topping of pork fat. But in a good way. Add perfect noodles, an egg and those lovely wood eat mushrooms and there's your great value satisfying dinner.
This is the original location, there's always a queue but I feel like it hasn't been quite as bad since they opened the new Leicester Square location. The new location is a better place for groups or if you want to linger with friends, but this location is perfect for the crowded noodle bar feeling, I love it",1
3,"Better tasting than Bone Daddies but really expensive for what you get. And the seating wasn't as comfortable or as inviting as Bone Daddies. And there was no super awesome cocktail menu either.
First impressions were great - 98% Japanese diners. Felt like I was in Tokyo again.
One neat aspect of this 24-seater restaurant is the way they handle their queue of customers. There are two benches outside of the restaurant, positioned end-to-end to create one long bench. If you see people sitting on the bench, then there is a queue, so follow these guidelines to join and ""work"" the queue: People seated on the bench closest to the door are at the front of the queue and people seated furthest away from the door are at the end of queue. As people from the front of the queue are seated in the restaurant, everyone on the bench slides down toward the door. Don't bother asking the hostess for available tables, just get in the queue.
Secondary impressions were good - diners seemed to be enjoying themselves slurping their bowls and such.
Tertiary impressions were just OK - I found £11.50 for a bowl of Moyashi Ramen a bit too expensive. On a good day, the bowl was worth £8. Why? The lack of pork. There were three small and thin slices, possibly an ounce in total weight. A shame, really.
The broth was good and the noodles were cooked perfectly (forgo ordering Kaedama (an extra portion of noodles) as you likely won't need any. I found there to be too many noodles in my bowl for my liking. 
There were a few condiments on the table, none of which included fresh garlic which was a huge disappointment. I've never eaten ramen without fresh garlic and loads of it.
Service was prompt and attentive, our server even kindly provided me with a fork so I didn't have to whip out my BYOF as I did whilst eating my way through Japan.
Overall, just OK ramen that overpriced.",-1
5,"Best ramen in London. 
Garlic topping + extra bamboo make your ramen even more tasty.
30 mins queuing time expected.",1
4,"This is probably one of the best places for ramen in London. Worth every penny. Also, be aware that there usually is a line, reservations are not an option.",1
5,"Was here during a rainy sunday, hence we only had to wait for 10 minutes for a dinner table for two. It was cosy and warm inside. Smell was incredible. Ordered their tonkotsu ramen and sour plum sushi. Note that the eggs come separately from the ramen. This was the first time i see my ramen served in very thick broth. It tasted really good and my meal was completed with the freshness of sour plum sushi. Definitely one of the best ramen spots in london.",1
5,"This is my absolute go to place for a ramen in London. I almost think this place does not need another 5 star review. I feel that a lot of people already know how good the ramen in this place is. The ramen is excellent. I eat this ramen slow as to enjoy it longer. When I do this, when my bowl is empty, I'm a very happy customer.",1
4,"Best ramen I had so far (comparing to the London region). I would be rated it among the top ramen places in  Egg was cook to perfection, the chashu was excellent. Right amount of fat and meat. Broth was tasty and rich (with the roasted garlic). The noodles are cooked to your liking. I would give it a 5 star, but there is always room for improvement. Also, I haven't had all the ramen places around the area yet.
Tried the original ramen.",1
5,"Yes you have to queue and the space is small but quite simply this is the best bowl of ramen noodles in London. 
The menu is small (which I consider a sign of a good restaurant).
They have some benches out the front too which is a nice touch when you get towards the front of the line.",1
5,"I came by on a weeknight at around 5:30 pm, and our group grabbed the last open table. When we got the menu I was surprised at how small it was, even though they had all the ""essentials."" I ended up going for the original, and I absolutely LOVED it. This was by far the best ramen I've ever had - the fact that it's the only ramen bowl I've ever completely finished is a testament to that. The noodles were the perfect thickness (thin, which is my personal preference), the toppings/pork were great, and the soup was absolutely phenomenal in its richness and flavor. I will definitely be back.
The only downside is that the place is extremely small - I can see why people before me said there was a queue - and so it feels a bit cramped...but honestly the ramen makes it all totally worth it.",1
5,"Definitely worth the queue - best broth I've ever had. 
Cool space - mostly communal tables but they're quite wide so it's not awkward at all with other parties being seated next to you. Quick and professional service and a fantastic bowl of ramen - served with thin noodles. Great value will definitely be back.",1
4,"The egg wins my heart so rich and flavourful. The pork broth was lovely milky, thick and hearty. Charsu pork is a bit too tender for me though. As the broth is extremely hot, you need to quickly finish the noodles before they become too soft. Everything is great but one thing there's a queue all day everyday here.",1
5,"What a line up!
Very good ramen that's served quickly and piping hot. Perfect. 
Deliciously broth that's extremely rich. 
No sake here. Only Japanese beers.",1
5,"This place has the bast ramen I've ever tried! I got the ramen with the spicy pork on top (sorry I can't remember the name) for just the right amount of spice once I mixed it all in. The sliced pork on top was the absolute best pork I've had ok ramen. It was so sweet and tasty, like it had been marinated for a long time. I'm weird about meat on ramen, so this is a huge win for me. Actually, I liked ALL the toppings. I ordered the noodles hard, which kept them nice and firm, as it takes me awhile to eat ramen. I also got the chicken karaage, which was AMAZING!! There was a bit of a line when I arrived, but I was seated within about 10 min and had my food 1 min after I ordered. This place is so much better than Bone Daddies, which was definitely a 2-3 star for taste, atmosphere, and service.",1
4,"Yes, I gave into the hype and stood in line for Kanda-Ya. In attempt to be strategic, I went for a late lunch around 14:00. Even staving off my interest and hunger, I did wait around 15 -20 minutes. I will give the staff credit; they treated seating like a competitive game of Tetris. Eating solo? Don't expect to sit at your own table. In fact, you are likely to end up at a four top with a group of three. Who doesn't love communal dining? 
Who cares, let's get on to the food!
* Sake Onigiri - I know, I know, I was there for the Ramen. It was late, I was hungry! It was a moment of weakness. I would describe it as light on salmon. Luckily, I really (really, really) like rice.  My recommendation, wait for the Ramen. 
* Original Ramen - I thought the fairest way to judge the restaurant was to order 
the OG:
Let's break it down:
o Noodle -The portions were plentiful and the noodles seemed freshly made.  The most genius part is you select the level of al dente that you would like your noodles cooked to.  If you don't like your noodles, that's on you. 
o Broth - Rich and velvety. I like the noodles better, but perhaps you are catching  on to my love affair with empty carbs.
o Pork - Dee-lish! The pork was thinly cut. I find that often thinly cut pork dries out. Not here. The meat was nicely marbled with fat and super moist.
o Overall - Super delicious
* Moyashi Ramen + Egg - My companion was fancier and went for the Moyashi Ramen plus an egg.  From what I can tell, the difference between the Moyashi Ramen and the Original Ramen is blanched beansprouts. To me no person would spend an additional £1 for beansprouts; I stood corrected.  
o The egg - My companion was adamant that the egg is the most important part. This egg was apparently very good. I quote ""perhaps even better than Bone Daddy's"". She did not offer to share, which could be interpreted as rude.
* Spicy Miso - oh wait... they ran out! I am convinced that a spicy sauce would have taken the broth over the top. 
* Black garlic sauce - it was good, but you know it was no spicy Miso!",1
5,"Kanada-Ya is hands down one of the best ramen places ever. The first time I walked by, a breeze carried the scent of freshly made noodles (yes that floury, doughy smell like freshly baked bread, except for noodles) right to me, and I knew that I had to go for a bowl of ramen.
I always get the original ramen for around £11. The broth was one of the richest broths I've ever tasted! It tasted like they melted down those pork bones and made it into soup. You can choose the firmness of the noodles, I usually go for the recommended option. The chashu on top is very tender and I like all the other veggies they put on top too. They have this green spicy pickled veggie thing on the side for free and I like to add a spoonful to my ramen for a spicy kick. Sometimes, I split an extra order of noodles with a friend when I finish my noodles but there's still broth left. 
The chicken karaage is also quite good. It was £6 and they give you around 6 big pieces. It's pretty standard so while it was really good, it's nothing extraordinary compared to other places. 
My only complaint is that there's always ALWAYS a line when I pass by (up to 2 hours one time) and there's only around a dozen seats in the restaurant. But that how you know it's good right?",1
4,"Visited here after a few drinks in the pub a few doors down with friends who had been before. The restaurant is small, and there was a queue but the wait was not long and we had chance to look at the menu while waiting so it was not an issue at all. 
I had the original ramen (without fungus, I am a mushroom-phobe and they were happy to oblige) with the recommended ""hard"" noodles. The broth was delicious, noodles tasty and I would certainly eat here again if in the area. It's a reasonably cheap, no frills place.",1
4,"Good grief, or yoi kanashimi, since we're talking ramen. Some Yelpers comments are out of line IMO. That said, I'm giving them a 4 for London (If we were in Japan I'd give them a 3). London is an expensive place to run a shop (and yes!, more expensive than in Tokyo IMO) so £10 for a bowl of ramen is sadly reasonable around here.   
Understand: Kanada-Ya makes Hakata ramen. This is a style that is pork based, has a milky white colour, and is full of delicious, yummy, lip-sticking collagen and fat. And remember, fat does not make you fat, carbs and sugar do. So if you're worried about your waistline why are you even thinking about going out for noodles?
 
Know: Kanada-Ya are specialists at what they do. So no, they don't have a gluten-free vegan ramen and they don't have a bar making green tea lychee 'tinis. If you want that go to Bone Daddies or some silly place like that. 
I should add that I'm really appreciative of a specialist and focused ramen place opening up in London that has the discipline and confidence in their cooking to just do one thing really well, instead of trying to offer 20-different mediocre dishes (ahem, Shoryu somewhat, or that London ramen atrocity known as Bento Ramen). Kudos to Kanada-Ya for focus. I hope this becomes more common here.
/// So the Ramen...
The Overall Bowl and Broth: It's good. It's not my personal favourite style, but it's a decent bowl. Overall I think it lacks punch, but again, they have their style and they are working hard at it. I'm going to experiment with some topping combinations next time and see what I can do to fix this.
 
Noodles: Mine were perfectly cooked to medium. Just like I asked.
Egg: Again, perfectly done. Not as good as Shoryu, but the eggs there are sublime- as good or better than many I've had in Japan.
Charshu: Was adequate. I prefer it saltier, but the texture and fat were very good.
Overall: This place is a welcome addition to London and will force a lot of people to step up their Ramen game. They will also keep Ippudo - who is about to open across the street - on their toes. While the service was a bit spotty, I'm willing to overlook this for now and chalk it up to them being new.",1
5,"Kanada-Ya is definitely a ramen place worth the wait! There is always a line for it, since the venue is quite small, but the Chashu Men Ramen is amazing. I ordered it with a Hanjuku Egg that was very well prepared as well. The ramen broth is a perfect level of saltiness and savoriness. I usually feel like ramen broth leaves me very thirsty, but this broth was not overdone at all. Additionally, the Hanjuku Egg was very well made in the sense that the yolk was not too dry or too runny. I would definitely suggest this place to any ramen lover!
ADVICE: There will be a line! Bring a coat because the line is outdoors. There will be a coat rack inside where you can hang up your coat when you're eating. Additionally, be prepared to share a table with someone. The venue is very small so you will end up sharing a table with a stranger.",1
4,"Good broth, exquisite chashu pork, decent toppings but the egg isn't a ""wow"" like Ippudo's (also the nori leaf has seen better days). Correct noodle hardness. The atmosphere is a bit hole-in-the-wall but it's okay for eat and go situations.",1
5,"Unpretentious ramen, right across the street from the big 'I'. 
Went for lunch on a weekday and had to queue outside for about 10 minutes before I was able to sit down. There menu is extremely simple. Three choices: original, with bean sprouts, and with pork collar instead of pork belly. Really, they could have done with one menu selection and just had the bean sprouts and pork collar as add-ons. After you choose your ramen you can choose the firmness of the noodles. I ordered mine firm and added an onsen egg. I also ordered a plain onigiri.
First, forget the onigiri. The rice is good, but the onigiri itself is forgettable. If you're still hungry after your ramen, just get kaedama and order more noodles.
The noodles and broth were both excellent. Noodles had a nice, firm bite and the broth was creamy and frothy, without being overly gelatinous. I really appreciated the 5 thick slices of chasiu. Some other London ramen eateries seem to give one or two paper thin slices of chasiu. 
This is the type of ramen restaurant that you go to, eat your food, and get out. Very different experience from other London ramen eateries, but also a very nice change.",1
5,"I ate at Ippudo and saw the que across the street.  After eating at Ippudo decided to check this place out.  
Went in there with a full stomach and yet I finished my bowl of ramen.  The boil egg was perfect, not too runny or hard.  The broth was Awesome.  
I loved the small cozy vibe.  And the food.  This is going to be my go to place whenever I am in town.",1
4,"Always wondered about this place as there is forever a line outside of the door, waiting. Deterred by the line, I never even attempted to find out what type of restaurant that was. That was until one day my Japanese friend invited me to check out a great ramen place. When I research the restaurant online, I realized that we were going to that line outside the door restaurant. By then, I was really looking forward to checking it out, because Ippudo, another great ramen place, is right next door and this ramen shop can still maintain such strong following, they must be doing something right! 
I got to the restaurant around 1pm and, of course, there was a line outside. Luckily the line moved relatively fast, and within 15 minutes, we got our seat. This is a great place if you have just one or two people going, any size larger than that, you probably should forget about it. The inside of the restaurant is very tiny, and even with very efficient use of space, the whole restaurant can seat about 20 people. No wonder there is always a line outside. 
The menu is extremely simple: ramen plus choices of toppings and rice balls. I kind of like it. I always have trouble ordering my food when I have too many choices. Here it is simple, order your ramen and how do you like it cooked and add any extra toppings. Go crazy and order a rice ball if you are hungry. I ordered original ramen with Hanjuku eggs. The food came very quickly and, man, that was a good bowl of ramen. The broth was rich and flavorful but not greasy and the ramen was cooked al dente. I swallowed the whole bowl in record time. I felt that I spent more time waiting for my seat than actually eating! However, it is definitely worth the wait.",1
5,"As a huge ramen enthusiast and broth snob, it is with great honour that I bestow best ramen ever to Kanada-Ya not in Japan. The broth is very well balanced, not too salty, black sesame spice has a great kick. Their service is also very fast, a great quick lunch during the work week. I dream of you..",1
5,Yup. you can taste the 18 hours pork bone broth. I had the Chashu-Men I think it is better than the Original.,1
4,"Good ramen, though slightly fatty for me. Intimate environment and good service! Suitable for group of two. Next time I'll try different hardness for the ramen!",1
5,"(7.26.15) I've never been to Japan. But I've had ramen in SoCal, NorCal, NYC, and the midwest. Enter London. Kanada-Ya has THE BEST ramen I've ever had. It's telling when Ippudo across the street is EMPTY (this wouldn't happen in NYC!) and there's a line out the door here. It was such a treat on the gloomy evenings in Bloomsbury. Can't wait to go back!",1
4,"Is a in between 3.5 and 4 start.
I have been there three times now.  They are less busy now compare to newly opening time. The menu is quite simple because they only have a few option which make it simple.  I had tongkatsu once and cha Siew twice. 
When you order you get to order the noodle texture and i like mine regular. The best part of the noodle for me is their egg. Some noodle does not come with egg but you can add the egg with extra £1. Once you finish the noodle you can order extra noodle to add into your remaining soup to eat. I tried it twice now but I felt that it is not as nice. Once the soup get cold you will find that the soup is quite salty and oily.",1
5,"As a ramen junkie, I've been searching for good bowls of ramen everywhere I go. I had heard amazing things about Kanada-Ya, and many claim that it's the best ramen in London, so naturally, I had to go! Also because I'm a huge fan of tonkotsu broths.
When I got there (around 1 PM on a Monday), there was a short queue, but nowhere near the legends that I'd heard of. After a friendly conversation with my fellow line waiters, I was seated in the restaurant.
To start out, I orderd an ume nigiri. For my main, I ordered the chashu-men with the mayu (black garlic oil) and hanjuku egg. They let you choose the firmness of the noodles; I chose hard because I like my ramen a tad undercooked (al dente?). They use the traditional thin straight noodles, which pairs well with tonkotsu.
The ume nigiri was exactly what I expected, the sourness of the pickled plum perked up my palate and made me excited for the meal to come.
They had some pickled kimchi-esque cabbage and ginger for you to just add to your dishes, as well as a toasted sesame seed grinder (which I of course used, generously).
The ramen came out pretty quickly and looked great. The broth was very good; one of the best tonkotsu broths I've had anywhere, not just London. The mayu was exactly what the broth needed to elevate it to the next level. The egg was a beautiful golden orange, and the slight sweetness of the marinated egg white was great in the savory and rich pork broth. The chashu was tender and melted away, though I would have preferred a slightly thicker cut, with more of a sear.
Overall, Kanada-Ya has one of the strongest tonkotsu broths outside of Hakata for sure, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves ramen who is in London. I hope they bring it to NYC soon!",1
2,"Before I even write anything, I am not going back there again. I have read some good reviews on Ipoudo and I'm hoping that their ramen is just as nice, because the service at kanada ya is absolutely ridiculous.
It was a Wednesday night at around 8:30pm. We queued for over 30 minutes which was fine. However, just as we thought the next table available would be ours, suddenly came two people that was at the Back of the queue and just sat down. We asked what was going on and as I was expecting the Guy to tell those two to get back in the queue, he simply said ""sorry there will be a table soon anyway."" 
fuming, I ordered my ramen just to find out that they literally have nothing left. No egg, no salmon o nigiri. could the two people that pushed in have taken my last egg?probably.",-1
2,"I love noodles and have been eating them at least twice a week, more so in Japan (at least 4-5 a week).  So I have been looking forward to Kanada-Ya's opening.  Sadly I was totally disappointed with their Ramen.  
We ordered one Moyashi and one Chashu Ramens.  Their Tonkotsu soup was simmered for 18 hours according to their menu and tasted justifiably so; however it simply lacked depth.  It just tasted congealing pork fat/bones with soya sauce and nothing else much.  Adding lots of black pepper did not help.  Good Tonkotsu soup should have different layers of flavours.  The thin noddle was cloggy/starchy; it should have been boiled in a much larger pot and shaken vigorously to remove as much starchy water as possible.  I didn't see the point of Kikurage (Woodear Fungus) as it only gave texture but was bland.  The only good bit was Chashu in Chashu Men; they (Collar) were leaner than those (Belly) used in other two types of Ramen and tasted as good as you get in Japan.
The menu was limited to three types of Tonkotsu Ramen and Rice Balls (Onigiri) and they were way too expensive.  Why the prices of Ramen are so high in London?  You can get very decent ones for around £4-5 in Japan and the quality you find in London does not justify the price tag.  Even in Paris, you can get nicer Ramen for around 7-8 Euros.
Very disappointing.",-1
5,"I'm probably going to write exactly what everyone has already said but here goes...
Amazing ramen! The broth is creamy, flavoursome and rich. The pork was tender and delicious. And the hanjuku egg - wow. Perfection! I ordered an extra egg because it was too good to just have one.
I also ordered the salmon onigiri but would give them a miss next time and go straight for the ramen. They're not bad but it's about the ramen here. 
This little ramen bar gets filled up very quickly and the line forms before it opens so prepare for a wait.",1
5,Best ramen I've had in London!!! Seriously. Ramen lovers you must try out this place if you haven't. IT'S GOOD. Enough said just go for it.,1
5,"Wowzas. Was this place worth the wait.
Even on a bank holiday monday there was a wait. As one of the first to arrive at around 12.20 there was still a 40 min wait, but it was damn worth it. Even though staring through the window at all the delicious ramen was tough!
The place is tiny. I think I counted around 20-25 seats. Two staff and two cooks.
Which was nice as the place had a warm cosy feel to it that would be very nice during the winter months.
I was going to order the standard ramen (there is not a lot of choice here) but my friend pointed out that they do a special which was detailed on the table. So I ordered the Gekikira Ramen, an ""18 hour pork bone broth, spicy tan tan style minced pork, charshu belly pork, beansprouts, kikurage, negi"" I have no idea what the last two were but it was damn delicious.
Service was quick. And the portions were Good. My previous favourite ramen place Shoryu was always excellent and had you full to bursting. However recently they've cut down on the portion sizes and a super stingy with the toppings.
Not so here, despite being a little cheaper than Shoryu (minus miso egg which isn't included by default, but a topping) they are quite generous with the meat. I got as much charshu pork belly as I normally get in my Shoryu bowl (note that's pork collar however, a bit more expensive) but I also get here a massive portion of spicy minced pork. Additionally from the orders of the pork collar I saw drifting around whilst Shoryu normally gives you 2-3 really thin slices, here they decorate your whole bowl in the stuff, so you get around 5-6 decently sliced pieces. 
The broth I haven't mentioned yet is excellent too. It tastes a lot cleaner and clearer than shoryu. Admittedly Shoryu is slightly more flavourful but oh well you can't have everything. Everything else, in terms of ingredients, quality and quantity are spot on.
Whilst there we also tried the sour plum onigiri. I didn't really like this much but more personal preference than anything. It was presented very nicely and was a decently sized portion. 
The only real improvement I can say is that they REALLY need another location as just thinking of the inevitable queue is making me sad.",1
5,"The broth is TO DIE FOR. Like I want to die by drowning in this rich milky broth please. As grim as that sounds- that's the most amazing way to go.
Hazel, Iz and I actually popped in here after drinks because we thought drinks and desserts first because ramen is always almost packed and we'd try out luck at ippudo. It didn't work. 9.30 and still an hour and half wait. So we popped over to kanada ya instead for a ten minute wait.
Loved that they offer different textures of noodles! I go for hard and springy (LOL- im talking about bed shopping, take your mind out the gutter) and garlic. And it's so simple and kanada just do it so well. The service was great, especially for hazel's dietary requirements. They were so accommodating! 
Take me back here to bathe in broth,
Please!",1
5,"Easily my favourite ramen place in London . It's tha place I go to when I want a taste of home.
The ramen is great and the broth is marvellous.
My favourite ramen here is the gekikara-men, since I'm a lover of spice. Best part is they don't hold back and adjust the flavour because of its location in the UK.",1
4,"A friend suggested Kanada-Ya for dinner after work on one of the hottest days of the year (23 degrees in London!)... not exactly ramen weather but perfect for waiting in a queue! I have always wanted to try it ever since it opened in the fall last year, when I got the invite to the 50% off soft opening but couldn't make it. I have however dined at its rival Ippudo across the street, which is a much more upscale, modern building with a bar area to wait and a cell phone texting service to let you know when your table is ready. By contrast, Kanada-Ya is a lot more like an authentic hole-in-the-wall.  We arrived around 7 PM and took our place in the queue, as the restaurant does not take reservations and it only seats about 25 people inside. There is a nice wooden bench to sit on, and the staff bring out menus for you to look at. The queue also moves fairly fast; there were 5-6 people in front of us to start, and we had our seats inside within 20 minutes.
We dined at two seats facing the far wall, near kitchen and the toilets, which wasn't particular scenic, but I don't think that is what they are going for. The menu is pretty straightforward - there are 3 main ramen options then a load of topping options. I went for the moyashi ramen, which is like the original ramen but with beansprouts, and then chose to add a hanjuku egg. For a drink I got the Hiver, a London honey beer. This come serves in a cool copper mug, and it tastes exactly like honey. I was sorely tempted by the onigiri rice balls, and meant to order one, but I forgot and it turned out to be a blessing since I couldn't even finish the ramen. My friend got the original ramen without any toppings, and she actually managed to finish her bowl. 
As for the food, I thought the bowl was good, but nothing spectacular. The egg was good, runny in the middle and interestingly enough, served cold. I ate them first because I didn't want them to sink into the ramen and lose the deliciousness of the yolk. You have the option of choosing the firmness of your noodles; I went with regular, but they just didn't seem like ramen to me - they were very thin and of dry, lacking the usual plumpness. The meat was tasty... we tried for a while to figure out the difference between pork collar and pork belly, but in the end concluded that you can't go wrong with pork belly. Aside from a ton of vegetables, the only other thing to note was the broth - it was good and not too salty. We added some of the mysterious looking pickles on the table halfway through the meal, which turned it actually quite spicy. Overall, it was not a bad meal, but there was nothing screaming at me to declare that this is the best bowl of ramen in London.",1
5,"Amazing ramen. 
The place is small but managed to squeeze myself in on the bar tables. 
I ordered the original ramen and it was beyond yummy!  The broth was perfection and you get to pick your choice of tenderness to the noodles. Soft was great.  The portion was large. You will be satisfied by the time you finish. 
Service was nice. The ladies and gentlemen were attentive and super nice. 
Will definitely come back before I leave London in a few more days.",1
4,"I arrived at 6:00 on a Monday evening and was surprised to see a line outside Kanada-Ya. ""Go across the street to Ippudo"" I mentally telepathed. No one budged.
Fortunately the wait wasn't long as I was one person. I was invited inside by the waitress, who locked the door behind me, I suppose to keep eager outsiders from barging in and bringing the draft with them.
I ordered the Chasiu Men and added an Hanjuku Egg (soft boiled and chasiu cured, um yesss) and garlic sauce, which brought the £14.50 meal to an intense level. There options of noodle springiness, which I appreciate.
Overall I liked it a lot, more so than Ippudo and Bone Daddies. So far it's holding up the #1 ramen spot in London on my list.",1
4,"Reasonable flavor, but not amazing for the price. Had the spicy pork ramen and an onigiri.",1
5,"Now, I'm no economics expert but I've heard that one of the keys to success for any business is location, location, location. To that end, I was very surprised to see that new ramen restaurant Kanada-Ya have sited themselves right opposite the newly opened 2 storey behemoth international ramen restaurant chain Ippudo
To be fair, Kanada-Ya is also an international chain with Japanese founder Kanada Kazuhiro bringing his authentic tonkotsu ramen from Yukuhashi, Japan to the world. However, the dimunitive premises of Kanada-Ya does make it feel like a David v Goliath situation between the neighbouring restaurants
Having said that, there was a healthy queue outside Kanada-Ya 15 minutes before opening time on the Saturday lunchtime when I visited. In fact, when the restaurant opened, people at the back of the queue had to wait as all the seats were quickly filled up
The menu is short and sweet - 3 versions of tonkotsu ramen, the main difference between the bowls being the cut of pork to make the chashu and a few extra ingredients like beansprouts
I went for the original ramen, which came with the 18 hour pork broth, chashu pork belly, wood ear fungus, nori and spring onion. None the options came with an egg, so I added a hanjuku egg for £1.80
Kanada-Ya's USP is that they wash the pork bones before using to make the broth. It perhaps made the broth taste a tiny bit more sanitised but being someone who feels that the broth is the most important element of ramen, I did enjoy it but perhaps not as much as Bone Daddies where I usually drink most of it whereas here, I left a lot of it behind
My noodles came 'normal' as requested, which were fine for me. The chashu pork belly was suitably moist if rather thin. The wood ear fungus added texture and I was glad there were no beansprouts (I'm looking at you, Shoryu!)
The bowl here is certainly worthy of entering my top 4 ramen restaurant rotation alongside Bone Daddies, Ippudo and Cocoro but my favourite still remains Bone Daddies, who also have the amazing Korean guinea fowl and sticky bones
Kanada-Ya only serve onigiri rice balls alongside their ramen but I didn't try any on this occasion",1
5,"What a treat. This place is fantastic. Both the food and the service were top notch.
The food: We had the chashu-men ramen and the tonkatsu ramen and both were some of the best I've had. I don't pretend to be a ramen connoisseur but I've been to a half dozen ramen places in the United States and tasted bad ramen and good. The ramen here is as good as the best I've had yet.
Price: It's a little steep for what it is. The chashu ramen is 13 pounds and the tonkatsu is 10.5, and if you want an egg in it that's 2 pounds extra; though that egg is tasty and adds a hearty flavor to the dish so you might as well go for it. There is a 10% service charge added to the bill automatically.
The location: It's a corner shop so it's easy enough to find once you get close, though it's not exactly close to a metro station. The place is very small though and seating is limited. We had to wait outside for a few minutes but the person at the door will happily hand you a menu to look at while you wait.
The service: I save this category for last because it so blew me out of the water. I've been to many European countries over the years and eaten a lot of different places and I have never had a server offer to refill my non-tea/coffee drink for free. I assumed that refilled drinks were simply a custom in the United States alone. Heck, you are lucky if a waiter even drops by your table after the food is delivered to check that everything is alright. Today I was proven wrong as helpful staff (more than just one) came by our table not once, not twice, but three times in our roughly 30 minute meal to not only check that everything was to our pleasure but also refill our water: the free tap water we were drinking. 
I legitimately felt bad that I didn't have enough hard cash on me (we were paying by card) to pay for an exceedingly generous tip but I left them all I had (a little under a pound). If you are there and have as good an experience as I did leave a few extra pence for me.",1
5,"Perhaps the best ramen I've ever had. I never eat pork, but here I eat all the pork in the bowl, and drink up the soup- amazingly rich.",1
4,Amazing Ramen! I went for the original with two eggs. Definately recommend coming here!,1
5,"This new ramen place is popular and rightly so.  The menu is smaller than most places, but this just means that they have concentrated on the best ramen and they are good at it.  These guys are the experts.
We both had the Chasiu men, which comes with slices of pork all around the top of the bowl and wood ear fungus.  This has an interesting texture.  I like how you can have the noodles cooked to your liking - I had mine cooked medium and my wife chose the hard noodles (cooked for less time, which gives a firmer bite).  This is the only place I have noticed this, on my ramen travels.
I observed the guys at the table near us both going for extra noodles. We thought they must be hungry!  But, it was definitely the right call as we both had a lot of tasty broth left at the end.  It is like having a 2nd ramen which, of course, I am in favour of.
The restaurant is a short walk away from Tottenham Court Road tube station, but Holborn is another nearby option.  We got there late on Saturday night and there was a line outside.  It was a chilly night, but there were some heaters on full whack, so we were comfortable.  Almost too warm even.  I liked how a member of staff would let us know how long the likely wait was and whether we would make it in before closing time (10pm on Saturday).
I expect that we will be back again, particularly as we are often in the Soho/Covent Garden area and it is a winter season treat.  Highly recommended.",1
5,Thank you Yelpers! This is the best ramen I have had ever!! Never been to Tokyo but this took me to Japan.  18 hour pork broth with your choice of spicy or savory.  Let me just say if you are in London go here! It is absolutely worth it! A line or a what the British call a queue is enviable because this place is awesome. Have fun and keep an open mind you will not be disappointed.,1
5,"I love this place! It offer the best ramen I have ever had. The soup was so delicious and the hardness of noodles was just right. Even though it is a very small shop, it is enough to enjoy a great ramen feast!",1
3,"Just had an original ramen - it is a much anticipated japanese tonkotsu ramen from japan. It is better than shorty or bone daddy... But not as good as I anticipated - soup is slightly off... It is rich and creamy but missing an exciting note leaving aftertaste quite rich... Pros are noodles and cha-shu. Especially cha-shu is the best in London... But of course, you would not be there for cha shu only.., without good soup, a bowl of ramen would never taste right... By the way, it's kikurage - tree grown mushroom, is supposedly specially cured from japan... It tasted not too special - too coarsely chopped and too big in my opinion...",-1
5,Best Ramen in London... not a really a big restaurant so it might be better to get there before opening and wait for 5 min until it open so you can get a seat first. The ramen taste really good. You can,1
5,"the best ramen place in london! the original ramen was awesome! add eggs and everything is perfect  definitely have to add eggs cause' its just too good it melts in your mouth. you can choose the noodles ( regular, soft/hard) depending on what you prefer, i asked for regular lol. it tasted very nice. the pork was  and the best part is the pork broth.. OMG.. i can drink the broth like theres no tomorrow haha. definitely should try this ramen when you come near holborn
the second time i came here i tried gekikara ramen (which is on their extra menu) i prefer the original one since i cant take spicy because they put a lot of chili ( i think) until the broth became red. but the good part is that they add shredded pork which is very sweet and tender i love it! overall i'll give 5/5",1
5,"One of the best ramen in London, has lots of char siu topping and fills you up! Definitely add the half boiled egg too. But avoid peak time because you can't book and you have to queue outside",1
5,"One of the best ramen we've had in London! Simple menu, super tasty. Great environment and really friendly staff!",1
4,"I've eaten at bone daddies, shoryu, tonkatsu and ippudo. Bone daddies, meh too watery. Shoryu noodles are low quality. Ippudo is safe but not knock your socks off good. I also grew up on the stuff in Hawaii. This is the best there is in London. Not leaps and bounds better than Ippudo, but good enough that it's worth crossing the street. That being said, if it's a massive wait or you are not in the area, Ippudo is a good alternative!",1
5,Firstly I would like to say it's the best ramen I have had in London. It's still not as good as when I had in Tokyo. But what would be. This is as authentic and flavoursome as you are going to get. The Hanjuku egg is a must. I had the Pork Chashu with firm noodles. It's a very small place so be warned that you might have to queue but it's worth it on a cold day for sure.,1
3,"Simple, good, satisfying ramen. The broth is amazing. There might be a small queue, but you are seated, served and provided with a big bowel of ramen quickly.",-1
5,"This place serves up by far the best ramen in London. It may be small and queues form as soon as it opens but it's worth a visit. The broth is packed with so much flavour and the noodles are cooked to preference. There may only be a few variations to pick off the menu, but all come with generous top quality ingredients. I ended up going for and would highly recommend the spicy ramen which didn't overpower the broth and topped it off with an extra egg which was still lovely and runny. (Visit - 18/05/2015 Lunch)",1
2,"People are talking about this restaurant and I can see a long queue waiting outside so I could not wait to try their Ramen. The menu is quite simple with only 3 items priced 10, 11 and 13. I order original tonkotsu ramen cost £10 without service charge which is a good price for a bowl of Ramen. However the bowl is so small and I literally can count 3 small pieces of pork. The soup is nice but I did not get it much as well as their noodle in such a small bowl. I complaint about this and the waiter said that's how everyone get it in here !!! 
To compare with other Ramen restaurant in soho, i do not think I will come back here as I will have better choices not too far away. And there is a new big Ramen restaurant coming soon just opposite this restaurant so I am waiting to see how long the queue will last.",-1
4,Delicious ramen. Very genuine and tasty and filling. Doesn't take reservations so allow time for that! Three types of pork ramen available. Would return.,1
5,"O Kanada [ya]!
Our home of porky broth! 
True chashu nestled amidst thine porky froth. 
With glowing hearts we savour thee, 
The True noodles hard - or soft! 
From far and wide,
O Kanada [ya], we stand in line for thee. 
God,  thine ramen's garlicky glory!
O Kanada [ya], we stand in line for thee.
O Kanada [ya], we stand in line for thee.
Yeah.
Where to start...Kanada-Ya is one of the newest ramen additions to London.  It's awesome.  Even though I've had to wait an hour for my ramen on one occasion, it's still awesome (beware, there are queues at lunchtime too).
Kanada-Ya is the David to Ippudo's Goliath bearing down on it from across the street in the premises formerly containing Damson Cafe.  There's not a lot of seating (maybe room for 25-30 people at a time?) and is perpetually steamy, thanks to the small soup area (to call it an exposition kitchen would be generous, it's pretty dinky).
Anyhow.  Kanada-Ya does very few things - tonkotsu ramen and onigiri (and ramune, for those of you into that sort of thing) - but it does them extremely well.  My standard order there is the chashu men (tonkotsu with the bowl rim lined with pork, fungus, and nori) with extra black garlic oil (highly recommended for all orders) and a hanjuku egg - it's a shame the egg doesn't come as standard, but never mind.  Also, you get to choose your noodle hardness (I go for extra hard just like my...abs) which is tripleplusgood: the noodles here are the thin Hakata-type - whilst I generally prefer thicker noodles, getting to choose noodle hardness really puts Kanada-ya up in my estimation.  The broth is delicious - I've been mulling it over, but I think the broth flavour just about pips Bone Daddies (there, I said it).  Simply put, one of the best bowls of ramen I've had - whilst I haven't been to Ippudo in London, I have been to a branch in Kuala Lumpur and Kanada-ya's is far superior.
Yes, the service is pretty haphazard.  But for me the ramen erases any bad feeling I may have about the place; besides, it's not like the staff are rude - it's more a case of inefficiency and hopefully will improve over time.
We're really spoiled for ramen in London.  Really spoiled.  It's an awesome time to be here.",1
4,"The first time I came here, there was a queue so I left. I came here for the second time and thank God there was no queue. But the place was still pretty packed and I was seated at the last available spot at a communal table. The service was very attentive and my food came fairly quickly. I ordered the Chashu Men and it was quite delicious. The broth is flavorful as expected, but I do find the frothiness a bit strange... I expected the chashu collar to be a bit more marbled and felt that it was bit too sweet for my taste. Maybe I should have opted for the pork belly instead. The noodles were good. And the sous vide eggs... ARE TO DIE FOR. It's perfection in that aspect compared to Bone Daddies and Shoryu in my opinion. Great place!",1
5,"the best and authentic ramen in London, for 100% sure. 
their chashu, broth, marinated eggs, black galic sauce are BOMBS! I'm so sure cux I have been there for 4 times alrdy....!! You gotta try it!!",1
4,"soup good taste.Plenty of wood ear fungus shreds and chopped spring onions (green onions)
seating not very comfortable as they are stools only.
waitress asked us whether you want ramen soft hard or very hard.We chose hard which is just right(dente)
However, no compulsory service charge applied unlike Ippudo across the road.",1
4,"Great service. I waited for half and hour in a cold day. Ordered original hard noodle and Japanese fried chicken. It were nice. The restaurant is cozy, and comfortable as a ramen restaurant. Great eating experience!",1
5,Beat Ramen I've had in London yet. Authentic flavours and a really cosy setting. It just feels right.,1
3,The line is about 1hour+ for a Friday night at 8:30PM. Place seats about 6 parties (2-4top) so be prepared to wait!,-1
5,"5 Stars. Hands down the tastiest, most authentic ramen in London.",1
3,Authentic Japanese ramen corroborated by someone who's lived in Japanese their entire life (me). Slow rotation is why I couldn't give it 4 stars. Definitely worth a visit.,-1
2,Moyasi Ramen with very rich broth (very fatty) was disappointing in this new restaurant.  There was very little meat -  three pieces of cold pork with lots of fat - and the stock was nothing special and bland. The Chashu Men's meat was better with soft hot pork.  This is a new restaurant so they have plenty of time to adjust the menu and flavour.  It is way too overpriced and not a good value for money.  I definitely had far better one in Japan.,-1
2,"The ramen is still delicious but the wait staff is terrible! We were the second pair of customers seated right as the restaurant opened for lunch service. About 15 minutes later, we were asked to move seats to accommodate another group AFTER our food had been served. We had to stop our meal to move our bowls and plates while the waitress swept crumbs from the table on to my head as I was reaching to move my bags. No apologies. Unbelievable!!",-1
5,"Yah it was good. 
I am always skeptical but when the chicken was so tender it flaked apart, I was impressed. 
The wait is long, but bring a friend to share.",1

3,"varunmurali.com/blog/dis…
Irani cafes have this inexplicable homely feeling about them. I absolutely love going to Kyaani with my brother back in Bombay. At Kyaani you have to get the buttery bun maska, spicy and juicy chicken farcha with the delicious gravy poured all over it, and of course the timeless salli boti.
I've actually never been to an Irani cafe outside of Bombay even within India. So when I head about Dishoom a couple weeks ago I was stoked! So many people recommended it to me so there was little chance I would skip visiting this homage to Bombay's Irani cafes.
I really wanted to love Dishoom, but unfortunately I felt a little let down. Though the menu was stacked with favorites of Indian cuisine, I saw few traditional Parsi dishes on it. They did have bun maska (though not for lunch) and keema pav and a few other classics.
Dishes
The keema pav was pretty delicious. Spicy and authentic. Complemented the hot buttered pav really well. I would have been content to stop right there given how filling and value for money that single dish was.
My friend who I was eating with vouched for the okra fries. He was not wrong. They were super tangy and chatpata. Fried well and not oily at all.
My friend ordered the pav bhaji. Not a fan. The bhaji was waaaaay too smooth. I strongly believe you should be able to actually tell what you're eating in a pav bhaji. You need different textures to come through. The bhaji also tasted almost too creamy. It felt more like a paneer makhani sauce than bhaji.
   
 The chicken biryani was the biggest let down. Mild, bland, uninspired. The chicken was tender I'll give it that. Not much else going on with the dish. It was just mushy and the rice was over cooked.
You can't keep me away from black dal. The menu featured it as one of their best items so we ordered it. Good, not great. Could definitely use a bit more flavor but the expected creaminess was there for sure.
Oh and the rose lassis were pretty great!
Would I come back?
I think I would maybe once a month or so, but I would definitely stick to the smaller dishes and appetizers. Unless someone else at the table orders a main course that tastes good that is!
I think the small plates are super value for money. They get you pretty full and taste great. Definitely worth checking out!",-1
4,"Dishoom is a beloved string of modern Indian restaurants in London. Though you'll find classic dishes like murgh malai and lamb samosas, Dishoom's rendition of Indian food is through the lens of Irani cafes in Bombay. 
The Covent Garden location is largely walk-in, and rain and shine you'll find shivering hordes waiting to get in and being treated to delicious cups of hot and milky chai. We timed it relatively well on a Sunday night and ended up waiting about 30 minutes to get in, and then another 15 at the bar.
The cocktail list is long and to-theme, including a thoughtful list of mocktails. The majority are 8.50 pounds. Cyrus Irani, my choice, was a straightforward tequila sour; Debonair was a fine frozen drink. By far the best drink here is the Hoppy Paanch, an IPA, Johnny Walker, and butter syrup concoction that tastes far better than that description. I drank most of my boyfriend's (oops).
Once seated in the cozy and buzzing downstairs, we ordered everything to share, with a little help from our waiter. Complimentary papadum with tri-colored dips was a satisfying, if standard, way to start off the meal; pau bhaji and okra fries (4.50 each) were both well-done and nice ways to continue our carb streak.
Our larger plates were spiced and fragrant gunpowder potatoes (6.70); decent lamb chops (12.90) strewn with pomegranate seeds; a fine chicken ruby (10.50); and a delicious but small prawn dish (17.50). Although we were happily in a food orgy, mopping up sauces with naan, I couldn't help but wonder what I was missing.Everything was done well, but nothing was really above and beyond in the way that, say, Pondicheri in Houston is.
 Prices are elevated but not too bad; we had a bill around 75 pounds for our party of four (excluding drinks), and that was somewhat inflated by the prawns. 
Service is rushed but reasonable given the popularity. Bathrooms are very nice. Decor and atmosphere in general is great.
I understand why Dishoom is a must-go in London, and it has plenty of convenient locations, but I was expecting something just a little extra.",1
4,"One does not go to London without going to the legendary Dishoom. It's the only place on Yelp that has 1300+ reviews and 4.5 stars. I had high expectations and was nervous that this place would be severely overhyped, but Dishoom was an A+ in my book.
I heard the wait times can be insanely long (one night we called and they said it was 2 hour queue for dinner). So we decided to go the next day for lunch and prayed to the food Gods. We got there at 12pm on the dot and our prayer was answered as we got seated immediately. The place was already packed on both levels. Decor is cute and what I love about this place is that for every meal purchased, they donate a meal to an organization charity :) More reasons to eat here!
We ended up with the chicken tikka masala (called chicken ruby on the menu), the paneer masala, black house daal, garlic naan, and the keam. Everything was beyond fantastic. As everyone suggests, I highly recommend the chicken ruby and  daal (vegetarian and slow cooked for 24 hours). Consistency was nice, creamy, and not overly thick. Tender chunks of meat that just pair so well with the naan. Thankfully for me, the food was not terribly spicy which made my eating experience more enjoyable.
Service was prompt, courteous, and on point. Water was always refilled without asking, and the flow of the place didn't make me feel rushed despite the growing lines outside.
Overall, I would recommend coming here to cross it off the bucket list. Wasn't expecting such amazing Indian food in London and am pleasantly surprised, but no complaints here :D
Note: the dishes do not come with rice. You need to order it separately and it costs around $3USD per bowl. 
Note 1: there also seems to be sister locations of Dishoom nearby? Haven't been there but would imagine it to be similar, so if this place is packed maybe stop by it's other location.",1
3,"I have to say this restaurant is overrated. Their food is good, but it's not that good.
They do not take reservations. We waited for about 35 minutes or so outside and then 15 minutes or so at the bar downstairs. Once again, their food is good but I don't think it's worth waiting for close to an hour. We ordered the lamb chops (my favorite), murgh malai, and chicken ruby. I would give 4 stars for the food, but with the long wait, I cannot give more than 3 stars.
Pro-Tip:
Even if the queue looks relatively short outside, it's likely to be a long wait as there are people waiting for their tables at the bar downstairs.
I would not return to Dishoom nor do I recommend this to anyone. There are many other good restaurants in London and there's also better way to spend time than waiting in line.

5,"It is well known that London has a sprawling Indian food scene that serves some of the best Indian cuisines outside of India. Dishoom, a small chain of seven ""Bombay Cafes"", is definitely on the top of the list for both locals and tourists alike.
Online reservations can be made for breakfast and lunch only. They do not accept reservations for dinner and the only way to get in is the old traditional way - stand in line! There have been times when we walked past a Dishoom during dinner hours and saw lines wrapping around the block.
The ""Bombay Café"" style features a casual but moderately upscale and comfortable environment with cool vibes. The atmosphere is friendly and vibrant, and is always a perfect place to chill, and to grab some yummy Indian food with a couple of bottles of Kingfisher.
VEGETABLE SAMOSAS:  The skin was paper-thin and fried to a perfect crispiness that when I sank my teeth into it, the skin just crumbled and melted away while the filling made with veggies and mashed potatoes greeted my mouth with a warmly spicy yumminess.
CHICKEN RUBY:  It looked like a variation of the famous tikka Marsala which was a tomato based curry with cubed chicken breast meat.  The ruby dish, however, came with makhani sauce which was silky and smooth. It really tasted like tikka Marsala but with a stronger flavor of ginger and garlic. It had a nice balance of sweetness versus spiciness and was delicious beyond words.
GUNPOWDER POTATOES:  If you asked me to recommend a ""must-order"" item then this is it, not just because it was so amazingly good, but also because you can't find this anywhere else. Skin-on potatoes were fire grilled, cut into pieces, then sautéed with butter and an abundance of peppers and exotic spices. It was without a doubt one of the most memorable potato dishes that I've ever had.
We also had a roti to mop up the sauce from the ruby chicken, some rice, and a bowl of vegetables. Everything was good beyond belief.
5 stars+",1
5,"About as good as it gets. Most recent visit, got the black daal and regular naan to start, followed by the chicken ruby with roomali roti. (It was a lot for a solo lunch...) The black daal is amazing, although there's so much else I want to try here it's hard to say whether I'd get it again next time. 
The chicken ruby, on the other hand, would be hard to ever skip -- I get that this is the most basic of Indian dishes, but it's so incredible, and the one here is probably my favorite. 
Of course, the naan (both the regular and, especially, the garlic) are amazing too. I really liked the roti as well, but it wasn't at the same level as the naan in my opinion, and actually made me appreciate how incredible the roti is at Roti King (where I went for the first time on this trip).
Overall, really amazing food for surprisingly cheap prices, if you can get in...",1
5,"Food: 5 | Service: 5 | Ambiance: 4
I don't think I can write much that other reviewers haven't said already. 
I just want to say the food was amazing. Ordering the fried okra is a must! I ordered the garlic naan and the chicken ruby as well. Since I dipped the naan in the chicken ruby I think I could've gotten the plain naan, but it was probably even more amazing with the garlic. 
Service was fantastic too. It was fast and accurate which is really all you can ask for. The server was charming as well. 
Highly recommend this place!",1

We were starving, but decided to wait here because of the amazing reviews.
The staff came out with Chai for those waiting in line which is a very nice touch.
We were given a wait time of about 40 mins but were let inside to wait at the downstairs bar in under 15 and then seated about 10 mins later.
We ordered all the suggested:
Pau bhaji - mildly spicy and full of flavor - SO GOOD, MUST GET!
Chicken ruby this dish was very good, I wasn't blown away by it as much as the pau bhaji, but it was still worth the order.
Black daal -  I was surprised by how much flavor this dish had since it's just ""stewed black beans"" but it's very good. I'm not a HUGE fan of daal in general, but they season it very well.
The bollybellini cocktail was delicious, I could have had 3 more if i wasn't so full from the food we ordered!
Calamansi smash I thought it was acceptable in comparison to the other, but my boyfriend really loved it.
I forgot the name of our server, but he was only on his 4th day serving and was absolutely amazing! He was friendly and very on top of everything. Checked up on us regularly and was never too far.
I think he was from Spain?
Anyway, the reviews aren't overly hyped, this place is legit and you have to make time to stop here.",1
5,"Came for breakfast after a quick flight in from Zurich -- excellent food, and an interesting middle ground between boring/traditional English breakfast food and Dishoom style.  I had the bacon naan sandwich (which was excellent) and fried eggs on chili cheese toast (also great), plus a breakfast lassi and espresso.  Probably the best breakfast I've had in Europe.  Unsurprisingly the restaurant is still packed even at 9am in a weekday.",1
5,"Came by Dishoom for lunch. They take reservations for lunch and breakfast, but not dinner. Definitely recommended to make a reservation - it's really easy on their website, and there is almost always a line when coming in.
Service is polite but somewhat curt and rushed given the amount of people there are coming through. There is a very large downstairs seating area, and the booths have fun fans that cool you down from the spice.
Their menu is huge with a variety of dishes from across India. Most of the dishes are sized and made to share, and the back has a large drinks and chai menu. The drinks are very small portions. Lassi is thick and yogurty, and the chai comes creamy and sweet. 
Favorite dishes:
House Black Daal: Amazing, very spicy and creamy. 
Chole Poori - chickpea curry with a very interesting pairing of sweet halwa mash, comes with puffy poori bread. Delicious must have.
Paneer: their paneer dishes are delicious, all well flavored with chewy paneer. The mattar paneer came in a sauce that was very tomato-y, and had very few peas.",1
2,"Overpriced items my lamb chop was way overdone, look nice but taste shit. 2 stars for the nice staffs.",-1
5,"If you had told me I would wait in line for an hour and a half on the street to get in the door, I would have said you were crazy! I had a quick bite for lunch during the week, and enjoyed it so much my wife wanted to try it as well. Saturday night there was a two hour queue, and we were told it was no shorter at their other establishments in the city! It ended up being a social experience, talking to others in line, so the time went by quickly. Probably better with a group. The food was indeed fantastic, which explains the popularity. The chicken tikka was so well seasoned that every bite was precious. Also enjoyed the ruby chicken curry, calamari appetizer and the nan. Plenty of tasty things on the menu, all very creatively prepared. Definitely a cut above some of the other more traditional Indian restaurants we tried while in London. You can make reservations on line 24 hours ahead if you're pressed for time.",1
4,"Yum yum yum! Tasty and unique (maybe unique, maybe authentic and I'm just ignorant) Indian cuisine! It's not your typical menu and actually pretty limited with the main entrees if you have something particular in mind. I got the chicken ruby curry and it was suuuuuper tasty. A bit of spice but nothing unbearable. Pair it over rice and you have a hearty, homey, meal. The lamb chops were tender and flavorful.
The mango lassi was AMAZING. 
The garlic naan was fluffy and perfect for dipping. The fried okra was good enough.
I don't think I'd wait over an hour for this. Come during lunch, the line is much better and it's the same experience!",1
4,"I visited Dishoom no fewer than three times within the course of my four-day stay in London. 
The first time, my dining partner and I ordered a variety of dishes and tried two different types of cocktails each. While I don't remember the cocktails anymore (I believe they were whiskey sours), I do remember that they were delicious - although not the most alcoholic. 
We shared the plain naan, chicken biryani , house black daal, and spicy lamb chops. I loved the spicy lamb chops and ate all of it since my partner was vegetarian :); the chicken biryani, although huge, was a bit too bland for my taste with dry chicken. 
The next time, another dining partner and I tried the jackfruit biryani, and cheese naan. GET THE CHEESE NAAN. It was the most delicious thing I've ever had. 
Also, I loved the different types of Kulfi on a stick - my dining partner from India said it should've been only a few cents on the streets of New Delhi, but I didn't mind spending a few bucks for the most delicious and creamy dessert of my life. 
Great service - make a reservation and you'll be all set!",1
5,"Best meal of curry I have ever had! 
Making online reservations is pretty easy. I made the reservation in advance based on my friend's recommendation and you should too! There's always a line at the door during meal time.
Since it was our first time here, we asked our server what she recommends but we ended up ordering too much food. What we were told was 3 dishes per person and everything is meant to shared. We order 5 dishes for the two of us so we ended with a bunch of food left and it's sad that we couldn't take away.
My favorite:
Chicken Ruby !!! (Chicken curry with a tomato based sauce)
Smashed vegetables with buns (forgot its name)
Black Daal (lentil with a creamy curry based sauce)",1
5,"My third time there but first brunch with them!
I love this place atmosphere: it's classy but chilled, the staff is nice and quick to serve you and the food...
I ordered the carrot, apple and ginger juice with the homemade chai (which is bottomless...) and the akuri plate ( made of spicy scramble eggs, homemade buns and a plum tomato)
Eveyrthing was delicious and very tasty! 
I totally recommend this place to enjoy fusion indian food for an original and tasty brunch",1
5,"A must visit in London. It's not exactly a chain but they have a few locations. if you come upon one...just go. It's worth.
Prices are fair but the bill can get pricey due to the tapas type of menu. Everything's to share (think azn dinners). The lamb is a MUST.
I've visited each time I've been to London and it's been perfect each time. A top 3 pick for me!",1
5,"Things to do:
1) Order the House Chai
2) Order the Bacon Naan
3) Repeat
We arrived around 11:15, 30 minutes before the end of breakfast and was seated within 5 minutes. The place was packed. Loud, casual ambiance with both table and booth seating. Looking around, you can see the naan being made fresh behind the counter.
For drinks we ordered the house chai and mint tea. The chai was the best chai I've ever had. Rich, spicy, and soothing, the (sadly) small glass of chai was an excellent way to start the morning. The mint tea could be smelled from a mile away, that's how fresh and refreshing the mint was.
We ordered the bacon naan, akuri, the big Bombay, and the kejriwal, which was eggs on chili cheese toast. The bacon naan was superb. The tamarind BBQ sauce complemented the bacon extremely well. The Kejriwal was just okay. The bread was kind of tough and the flavors didn't meld too well together. I'd rather have had a second naan. The other people in my group enjoyed the Akuri and The Big Bombay, especially commenting on the taste of mushrooms. 
If I could give half-stars, this place would get 4.5/5. Not perfect, but pretty darn close.",1
5,This was my favorite Indian cuisine experience in London. The modern chic decor with touches of tradition came together well in the basement bar. We sampled several vegetarian small plates. Get the black lentils! They were cooked perfectly and well seasoned. I will keep Dishoom on my list when I return to London.,1
3,"Cool atmosphere but to me I was expecting robust Indian food. The chicken ruby and black daal were bland in flavor. They said they had to ""cater to the masses"" when asked about dishes like Vendaloo.
I just say this because it is the first listing under ""indian or bangledeshi"" food. This is more of a Iranian fusion joint.",-1
3,"My wife and I went here during our last night in London because it had a good Yelp rating along with the other parameters we used. I thought the food was great and normally the pros and cons of the place would have evened out to a 4 star experience, but the waiter we had was so bad that the meal ultimately ruined what would have otherwise been a pleasant end to our U.K. vacation. Frankly I wanted to give this place 2 stars, but I'm restraining myself out of a greater sense of fairness and keeping it at 3 because I think overall this place is well managed and I can't justify dropping it lower mainly because of one waiter with a bad attitude. Thus, at the end of the day we sort of got what we paid for (3 stars), but it's not a place I'd really want to go back to or even recommend for others to try (3 stars).
When we first arrived we reached the back of a line outside the door and the staff did a great job of managing our expectations re: wait time and I thought it was really nice that at one point one of the waiters actually came outside with complementary tea for all of us. One of the people in line with us talked about how one of his friends always wants to come to this place whenever he visits London and I really liked how we could see what people were doing in the kitchen.
Then we got in and we had this waiter who seemed nice, but after the first glasses of water he never refilled them for us after being asked more than once. Thank God the food wasn't too spicy -- otherwise, we would have been in trouble! And he did that thing that too many waiters do where they hold you hostage with your bill and you have to flag them down, and this was getting pretty late on a Sunday night. Overall it gave us the impression that he just had this attitude of oh, these people are just American tourists, they'll never be back so forget about them. Adding insult to injury our bill had something called ""voluntary"" [tip/gratuity] instead of just charging an honest price for each of the items and managing our expectations instead of making us think oh wow, these prices are actually reasonable despite being in the heart of London.
Negatives:
-really small portion sizes -- this was to be expected and considering the prime location would not have been an issue if other basic things had been up to par
-no complementary rice -- this is more of a critique of U.K. Indian restaurants in general, but really? It costs almost nothing to make rice and an Indian restaurant without free rice is like a Mexican restaurant without free chips & salsa
Positive things:
-Excellent fresh taste, about as good as one could expect of Indian food (psst! There's also a great Indian restaurant in Salisbury near Queen Elizabeth's Park that's even better. My experience in the U.K. is that restaurants in outlying areas are better in addition to being more economical and in London you're better off just going to one of the big grocery stores)
-Great atmosphere, no complaints there
-From a cultural standpoint I liked that they offered Iranian items -- the lamb was quite good",-1
5,"One of my favourite Indian restaurants in London. 
Food is fresh and has a modern twist.",1
5,"My favorite place in London.
I had original yogurt, it was awesome.
So cozy and every staff are so friendly.
I'd like to come here again.",1
4,"We went to dishoom for breakfast. It was a really nice place with a great ambience. We are from Mumbai so Irani cafe resonates with us. The ambience is lovely and the menu for egg breakfasts are phenomenal.
For non egg eating vegetarians this place is a bit tricky as there isn't much. All in all still a very good experience. Very reasonbaly priced for breakfast.",1
4,"After reading several reviews, I went to Dishoom expecting the food to taste amazing. We asked the waitress what to order and she told us her three favorite dishes. We ordered all three. The food was good but not excellent. The garlic naan was thin and burnt. We were disappointed in naan. The rest of the food tasted average, nothing too special. 
The mango lassi was okay, but I've had much better.",1
5,"Came to this place with a couple friends for dinner. They had us sampling chai tea and lemonade while we were waiting in line. The line moved pretty quick and before we know it we were seated. We waited about 45mins which wasn't bad. We ordered 4 entrees for the 4 of us. We also ordered 2 sides which were bowl of greens and basmati rice. All dishes were amazing and it was an awesome experience. Most of their dishes are dry and not saucey like other Indian places I've been to in the past. We were all stuffed and super satisfied with the service and food. Definitely a great place for romantic dinners with the dark atmosphere inside. Even though we were full, we still wanted to order more. It was impossible to stop talking about it after we left the restaurant. 
Garlic Naan: Oh my god! The garlic naan was perfect with the chicken ruby we ordered. The naan itself was just as amazing. It had just enough garlic and butter on there to make it super flaky and good. 
Mahi Tikka: Hands down best dish of the night! There were 4 big pieces of fish which was perfect for each of us to try one. The fish was super fresh and amazingly good. It pretty much melted in my mouth after taking one bite of it. I've never seen fish at an Indian restaurant before, but man this was literally hands down best dish ever! I almost wanted to order another one. 
Chicken Ruby: This was really really good. It was the red tomato sauce with chicken in it. There were big chunks of chicken in there which were super tender. I ordered some rice and ate it with the sauce. The sauce wasn't super overpowering the chicken or over spiced at all. I'm super picky with my sauce, but this was really good to the point that I would be able to drink it just by itself. 
Dishoom Chicken Tikka: This was probably one of their signature dishes. The chicken thighs were super juicy and smooth. They definitely didn't over cook the chicken.
I will definitely come back when I visit London again.",1
5,"Amazing! Love everything about this restaurant, from food, to decor, to service. It could not have been a better experience and the Yelp reviews were right on! Okra fries are a must. The Ruby's chicken is basically chicken tikka masala but a bit sweeter and creamier than most. The lamb is basically a vindaloo that was amazingly delicious. The kids portion was big as well. It is NOT a great place for vegetarians. And it's not great for the waistline I'm guessing. But you must go if in London!",1
5,"Upper scale Indian food? Doesn't sound like a thing right...guess again. We're so used to hitting up the cheap all you can eat Indian buffets..that Dishoom atmosphere, presentation, and selection just blew me out of the water. There will always be a wait here... but the hostess stand makes up for it by serving hot chai and mint tea to those who are in line! Tasty as well. Took about 35 minutes to be seated so I was starved. We started out with cocktails, the bf and bro got the house beer while I gotta chilitini, spicccay but really all the drinks were very unique and delicious sounding... wish I wasn't a broke med student. We didn't want to eat too much but did anyways. Started out with the okra fries.. so crispy. The got the pav bhaji, Dishoom chicken tikka, and chole puri. The most flavorful was the chicken, very tender pieces and creamy curry. It was a little different, they put a lot of lime juice  in the chicken tikka .. was s different spin I've never seen before, but very tasty. I think the chole was the most underwhelming, couldn't compared to the chicken. Pav bhaji was flavorful as well but messy. Dessert we shared a malai kulfi, yum... a sweet end to a very filling meal.
Expensive? Yeah but what isn't in Europe? Don't go here if price is an issue. But... you'd be missing out honestly, it's definitely worth the experience even if it's a one time thing.",1
5,"This is hands down one of the best Indian meals I've ever had. I knew very little about this place other than that more than one person recommended it on Facebook. It was only later that I'd notice that Ruggy and other Yelp dignitaries had experienced the majesty of this modern Indian tapas hangout slinging traditional street flavors.
Being jetlagged and coming here at 4:30 pm probably helped my cause of getting in without much fuss. The wait was about 5 minutes and only the arrival of my East India Gimlet and lamb samosas were able to drown out the guilt I felt over snagging a three-person table by myself.
Before I was seated, I waited at the bar downstairs and had time to admire the cavernous layout and dimly lit rooms, surprisingly sexy and mysterious compared to the Indian restaurants I've experienced in New York.
I ordered up the items I understood to be standouts here, and they didn't disappoint. In addition to the aforementioned lamb samosas, the house black daal and chicken ruby curry were both out-of-this-planet good. I mean, plate-licking good stuff. Make sure you don't miss either dish.
Looking forward to a return visit on my next trip to London. Come at off-peak hours and order up a bunch of stuff. This is a place for sharing, yours truly notwithstanding.",1
4,"I live in the Bay Area and we love our Indian food so I knew we had to try Indian food on our London trip. This place came highly recommended and we decided to go for breakfast. 
I immediately noticed this restaurant is decorated and serves food from more of a colonial perspective, whereas in the Bay Area, it seems more homey. I guess this isn't too much of a surprise given the history between the two countries.
We had:
-KEEMA PER EEDU:
A Parsi power breakfast: spicy chicken keema studded with delicate morsels of chicken liver, topped with two runny-yolked fried eggs and sali crisp-chips. Served with home-made buns. 
This was my boyfriend's dish and he loved it. Said it was better than the typical versions he had of this and that the buns were delicious.
-DATE & BANANA PORRIDGE:
Organic porridge oats cooked with milk, banana and sweet Medjool dates 
We weren't sure what to expect with this dish but both really enjoyed it. The banana gave it a fresh flavor and the dates sweetened the porridge without making it too sweet. This is free refills but honestly, one bowl was enough for the two of us.
-EGG NAAN ROLL:
Two fried free-range eggs with saffron-yellow, runny yolks. Warm and most gratifying 
I ordered this because it seemed unique. It was but the sauce may be a bit sweet for some.
-Chai tea: pricey but delicious
I really enjoyed this spot and will have to come for dinner next!",1
5,"I knew I wasn't going to come to London without dining at Dishoom, I foolishly tried walking over at around 630P to dine before a 730P production in the area. Laughable!!! My advice, DO NOT DO THAT! This place is crazy busy and the wait time was well over an hour on a Friday evening after 6P. I stood there for awhile contemplating weather or not I thought I'd make it in and have enough time to enjoy dinner before realizing it just was not going to happen. I asked the host what time they close and if they are this busy after theatre. He mentioned there would be a wait later in the evening before they close but it wouldn't be this long at all. I decided then I'd hop out of the line and go to theatre hungry. 
I came back at around 1015P and waited for around 20 minutes and enjoyed the best dinner. All of my usual, very basic (I know) menu items: somosas, Ruby Chicken, Rice, Cheese Naan, a beer and their delish warm chai tea they pass out to the folks waiting outside in the cold for a table.
Service was friendly, food arrived quickly and I was in and out in less than an hour.
I'd definitely recommend dining here but planning it out accordingly since no one really enjoys waiting long periods of time to eat.",1
5,"I must return. With all the hype, I was surprised even MORE people aren't talking about this place.
I love Indian food to begin with, but this goes far past the food. The queue was obviously long. But worth the wait. Mostly for such hospitable waiters who came by with different drinks like warm chai tea or sherry wine or lemonade. All so delicious too. Then it started raining and they brought out large umbrellas!
The staff, for working at such a popular, busy restaurant, were friendly, upbeat, and playful! I loved that they weren't grudgingly leading the next millionth customer to a table.
Can we talk about the atmosphere? The hanging lights? The beautiful decor? I was head over heels for everything. Even the toilet!
The lamb chops were definitely delicious. My friend ordered garlic naan to share, and I was surprised the garlic was actually so present in comparison to other sad naans I've had. 
Definitely wouldn't mind using up another London trip to eat here again. Beware of an hour wait though! It'll be worth it.",1
1,"My hubby and I came here because of how many good reviews this place has. When we walked up to the restaurant it looked very nice but noticed there was a long line waiting outside (not a good start since it was very windy and cold that night). A lady came up to us to let us know it'd be about 1 hr wait and although we were pretty hungry we decided to wait. 
Outside looking in we could see a long row of empty tables, which we assumed was for a large group who had reserved (funny I saw a review that said they don't take reservations...hmm?). We waited about 30 min outside. We then were lead downstairs to wait inside at the bar for another 20 min or so until we finally got seated upstairs. Looking around we still noticed the long row of empty tables with no group.
The food honestly was not the best. I liked it but back in FL I've had much better Indian food with wayyy tastier garlic naan bread. Our server was very nice but didn't check up on us as much as we would've liked (that could be a UK thing though, since we are from the US the servers are always coming up to ppls tables to check up on them). The drinks were good though(1 star for the drinks)
After about 10 min of us at the table finally we see the big group come in to sit at the long empty row of tables. I'm pretty sure everyone that was waiting outside in the cold could've sat at those tables and been done eating by the time that group arrived. I've never been to a restaurant where they reserve your table for more than 10 min for your group to arrive and have waiting customers outside in the cold. Even with all that I wouldn't have been so annoyed if only the food was to die for but it wasn't. It really wasn't all that great.",-1
3,"3.5
Apparently a trip to London is not complete without visiting Dishoom - if you're in the area I'd definitely check it out (there's a few locations around London).
Came on a weekday afternoon for lunch and was seated right away. The decor is rustic with a mix of contemporary - not like your typical North American designed Indian restaurants which was unique. I really liked the vibe here - not too loud with bustling kitchen sounds and aromatic Indian food being prepared. There's cut-outs of articles on the wall and marble tables...it's quite aesthetic I have to say. 
I wasn't too overly impressed with the service, in fact I would say that's what takes away part of the stars for my rating. The waiter was questioning whether I knew Indian food (I definitely do, ahem)...in any case the food arrived swiftly. 
I got the matar paneer which was a curry made with soft cheese (tofu like texture) and the naan t accompany it (costs extra) and my friend got the biryani. The paneer was delicious and definitely had authentic flavours (can confirm authenticity after having paneer in India a few months back). However, this place was quite pricey for lunch...I'd go back occasionally if it was in my route. For the price I'd expect much better service and a more unique menu instead of standard Indian fare. 
In all not a bad experience and if you're in the area (Trafalgar Square) definitely venture in!",-1
5,"I hate waiting for food. I see no reason to make yourself feel terrible when you can easily relieve your pain by walking across the street. 
But, Dishoom is the rare exception I will make. I came at 9 PM and had to wait 70 minutes to be seated, but after hearing the hype, I knew I had to verify. (also 1 hour is probably the furthest I'll be masochistic for)
I ordered the jackfruit biryani, chicken ruby, and plain naan. I'd been starving all day, but wow this was incredibly filling. The ruby was my favorite. Think tender chicken with a rich, silky makhani sauce. Essentially a curry with spice and flavor. Smooth like butter. The biryani was great too - a veggie option to balance out the savoriness of the ruby. The sauces that came with the dishes were also incredible, with a spectrum of yogurt sauce and spicy sauce and in between. Overall, I appreciated the breadth and depth of the menu options as well as the accommodating items they served with them to ensure anyone will be satisfied regardless of taste preference. 
The restaurant was beautiful as well. They give you a newspaper like menu in a headline-like fashion featuring the different menu options, while giving an overarching background story about the restaurant's mission on the top header. Found it pretty cute. Even took it home for kicks and giggles to memorialize this visit.",1
5,"Seriously DELICIOUS!!
I rarely enjoy Indian food, and when I do it is rare that I enjoy the entire Trinity- food, drinks, ambience.  Dishoom has nailed all three!!!",1
5,"BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER. Hands down, no questions asked.
Came here with my mom and sister and here's what we ordered:
1. Prawn Koliwada (6.20)
2. Dishoom Chicken Tikka (7.90)
3. Paneer Tikka (7.70)
4. House Black Daal (5.90)
5. Chicken Berry Britannia (9.50)
6. Chicken Ruby (9.50)
7. Garlic Naan (2.90)
8. Steamed Basmati Rice (2.90)
Every single dish was outstanding! If I had to choose my top 3 dishes to order they would be the Prawn Koliwada, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and House Black Daal. But honestly, you cannot go wrong with any dish you order! The Prawn Koliwada was so crisp and fresh and the chutney was unlike any I've ever had! I was so obsessed. Both the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and House Black Daal were so flavorful and rich in the best way. The chicken in the Dishoom Chicken Tikka was tender and juicy and cooked so nicely.
The service here is fantastic and the ambiance is very fun and trendy. If you have not been here before and you're visiting London, Dishoom is a must! My family and I arrived here around 4pm and waited for about an hour! Apparently the wait is much longer near dinner time so if you're flexible I would definitely come as early as possible! Would love to come back to Dishoom the next time I am in town.",1
4,"Dishoom was our first dinner in London! It was beautiful weather so standing in line for about 40 minutes didn't seem like a chore! They provided us with lemonade in line and then sent us inside to the next part of the line, which was the bar area. Their seating/waiting system was really well thought out and seemed very efficient! We were seated in under an hour, which was our original quote time. The food was delicious! We tried a lot of entrees and were absolutely stuffed by the end. 
We ordered the paneer tikka & vegetable samosas to start, all were delicious. The flavor on the paneer was good! The chutneys that are served with the breads and starters are amazing! 
For dinner we ordered the Lamb Boti Kabab- grilled lamb, which was perfectly cooked and so tasty. The Chicken Tikka flavor was great, the meat is chicken thigh, so be aware if you aren't a fan of dark meat! The Chicken Ruby was also interesting and tasty- a sweet and spicy sauce, it was a unique chicken dish! We also ordered the Gundpowder Potatoes- SO GOOD, probably my favorite thing we ordered, a variety of spices that really was a perfect combination. A few naan bread as well! To finish we had the chocolate pudding with chili ice cream. 
I would say the food is well priced and tasty! They have a smaller menu, but that allows them to get food out quickly- if you are looking for a lot of the classics you won't necessarily find them here. Everyone at the table was impressed with the food. 
Service at our table is where our review turns a little negative. Service from our specific server was a little lack luster- we had to ask someone else for water that was walking buy with a pitcher. Our server left and went on break during our meal, and so we were left with no one to get our check or clear our table. We waited a significant amount of time and didn't spot her, but finally saw her come back in with take away food for her break after 25 minutes. Thankfully we were able to steal a waiter from another area to help us get our check. Overall it was a fun experience- I wish the service at the table would have been as stellar as the service during our wait! Food was good!",1
5,"This was our first ever Indian/Irani food experiance ever and it didn't disappoint! 
First we started off with drinks since we had a 20 min wait (no biggie on a saturday at 9). I got the cobada colada (I think, it's a tongue twister!) It was absolutely delish and tasted like a vacation in a glass.
Once seated, our waitress was incredibly kind and recommended a bunch of stuff. We went with the black daal, chicken ruby, gunpowder potatoes, rice, and garlic naan. All were so flavorful and tasty. Our favorite dish was the chicken ruby. All dishes are meant to be shared. Everything is also very reasonably priced in my opinion (nothing we got was over 10.)  
For a restaurant with over 1200 Yelp reviews, I see why! A unique and exciting food experiance.",1
4,"Had to wait outside but wasn't too bad and they hand you chai or mint tea while you wait. Probably waited 30 mins for a table for 4 on a Wednesday evening. 
For apps we shared be okra which was my favorite dish of the meal, shrimp, and bau bahji. Mains we had a chicken tikka masala type curry (was called something else but was similar to this) and a South Indian shrimp curry. Neither of these were mind blowing but still good. Their red chutney sauce was another highlight.",1
5,"We booked Dishoom for our office Christmas Party dinner because our events coordinator is totally bomb. That also means we didn't have to wait for 2 hours outside!! HAZAHHHHH!!! 
This is now my third visit to Dishoom, and to be quite honest, it has only gotten better and better for me. I'm not even quite sure how to describe this experience because it was so amazing. 
Well, they have a Christmas dinner option with different price options. We had the £30 option which included 3 starters, and 5 entrees, and an option of 1 dessert. It was family style and there was so much food. 
Anyway, the point is you should go for Christmas dinner because it's awesome, and if it's not Christmas, you should still go because it's delicious. See below for my fav dishes:  
Bhel (crunchy puffed rice tossed with fresh pomegranate, tomato, onion, lime, tamarind, mint)- it's a lovely starter with especially nice textures and very fresh. 
Samosas- because samosas. 
Jackfruit Biryani- The jackfruit tastes like chicken- it's even got the texture of chicken and it's very confusing for a vegetarian but also a wonderful experience. Hahahahaha so weird. Anyway, the rice itself has fantastic flavour and a good amount of spice. One of my favourite dishes  fo sho. Sometimes rice makes me nervous because I feel like it'll be too dry, but this rice is so great and perfectly balanced. 
Mattar Paneer- Creaaaammmy baby! It's just so good. The sauce is the magical thing. It's so rich and delectable. The paneer is a nice touch, but I'd just take the sauce with the peas. Delish. 
House Black Daal- So, the first time I tried this dish, I wasn't crazy about it. I don't know what it was. But the second time... holy guacamole batman, this shit hit the spot. (apparently I start to sound super American when I get very enthusiastic about something and I'm now starting to notice it as I type). BUT FOR REAL GUYS THIS DISH IS SERIOUSLY LIKE THE BEST. There you go. The flavours are so deep, and it's like the flavour just gets deeper and more delicious as you eat it. 
Their mango Kulfi on a stick is absolutely amazing. I was so full but I managed to eat mine and two other people's because they were so creamy and delightful! 
***random side note*** I was actually very upset towards the end of our meal because there was so much food left over and I didn't want it to go to waste. (We were going to a bar afterwords) I started freaking out a little bit and eating way more than normal, but wasn't hardly making a dent. Then I had the genius idea of just taking it all with us out and back home. So I did. And I brought it to work the next day and fed everyone twice! WINNING!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and of course I also kept extra for myself. 
I LOVE DISHOOM.",1
1,Called for a reservation a week ago for 9 tonight and got turned away unless I could wait another hour...,-1
5,I first heard of this place through Andrew Zimmerman show on travel channel. He never steers me wrong. I came with a friend on a Sunday in the afternoon. There was only about a 20 min wait and we were able to wait at the bat and even offered a free glass of sherry or lemonade while we waited. The food was fantastic and came quickly. We had the chicken and lamb bryani. It was amazing. Definitely suggest trying this place if you like Indian food or want to try authentic Indian food for the first time.,1
1,Very disappointing ordinary food. There are so many great Indians in london this doesn't hold a candle to most .,-1
5,"Absolutely amazing 
worth the wait.  Get chicken Ruby , garlic nan and Shrimp Marcella  
If possible.   upstairs in a booth
With a server name Antonio",1
3,"Pretty good food. Pretty bad service. While visiting London I wanted to come here because of the great reviews. Unfortunately we came later on in the evening and our waiter was apparently ready to go. He rushed us to order, didn't refill our beverages, and didn't even check on us until he brought the check. We had to tell one of the other waiters to find our waiter for us. 
Since we were rushed to order and didn't get to thoroughly look through the menu we just ordered a few different tapas. Then he kept telling us to order more because what we had wouldn't be enough...it was wayyyyyy too much food! Some good, some just ok. My favorite was the okra fries. I devoured them! The prawns were pretty good just very spicy. I also liked the chicken wrap, basmati rice, and chicken ruby. The samosas were just ok. I didn't care at all for the potatoes. And I don't even recall the bread. 
This was my first time trying Indian food and I liked the flavors for the most part.",-1
5,"Wow! I cannot say enough about the food at Dishoom. I adore Indian food but my cousin, not so much. Even so, she thoroughly enjoyed the food at Dishoom. We ordered several items to share among our group of 4. Chicken tikka, Mahi tikka, Chicken Ruby, gunpowder potatoes, lamb samosas and 2 orders of naan bread. Our favorite dishes were the samosas, chicken ruby and potatoes. The chicken tikka had some grissle pieces so the quality of meat wasn't up to par and the mahi was under seasoned for my taste (and it's really tilapia). But the service was amazing and the side sauces were a nice addition to any bite. I loved the red spicy sauce on everything! I highly recommend this restaurant and the chicken ruby with a starter and some naan.",1
5,My absolute favorite for casual Indian cuisine. Located conveniently in Coventry Gardens. Highly recommend!,1
4,"Favorite restaurant in London period. Took a star off due to the wait times for all the locations. Their kala sherbet is amazing, always get the chicken ruby with rumali roti. Their spicy lamb chops are great. The seikh Kebab was dry last time. The place has a great vibe and service is generally quick and good. Highly recommend.",1
4,"Indian food? Heck yeah! Indian breakfast foods? Sign me the F@%k up!! 
To be honest, I did not really know what Indian breakfast food was before visiting Dishoom. The Indian restaurants in Florida mainly serve lunch and dinner only, so an Indian restaurant open for breakfast definitely piqued my interest. There's multiple Dishoom locations throughout the city. For breakfast, we made a reservation online at their Covent Garden location. When we arrived around 8:30AM, it was pretty empty! I don't think the reservation was even necessary at that point. But around 9:30 -10:00 AM, when we were leaving tables were filling up quickly. 
For appetizer, we ordered the bacon & egg naan roll. Hot & fresh baked naan with chili tomato and fresh herb sauce. I ordered the Kejriwal as my main meal, which is two fried eggs on chili cheese toast. The fiance ordered The Big Bombay, the sausage and baked beans English-style breakfast with an Indian twist. Every plate was bursting with bright colors and looked absolutely delectable. An explosion of flavors in each bite. 
Go early to avoid the lines. Best and most unique breakfast you'll have in a while! We loved it so much that we visited another location by the train station for late dinner.",1
5,"Quick summary: Delicious Indian cuisine in a lively upscale location
I made reservations to eat here long before I came to town because I was way too excited about trying the food that local and non-local Yelpers rave about. The ability to make reservations online way in advance is an automatic plus-one rating from me. 
First thing I noticed was that there was a huge line forming outside in the rain. Once I mentioned the reservation, we were led to our table on the ground floor immediately. The kitchen is on this level, so you can see the craziness from your seat. There is a downstairs portion of this restaurant, which I was grateful to not be seated in because there are no windows and I get claustrophobic. However, when I went down there to use the restroom I notice it was very interestingly decorated, with little alcoves for your party and different artwork. It probably is also less hectic and provides more intimate seating. 
Here are the dishes I tried with photos attached: 
Keema Pau- spiced lamb appetizer to get you going
Masala Prawns- Large, grilled, and seasoned
Roomali Roti- A paper thin bread 
Chicken Ruby- Luxurious chicken curry
Garlic Naan- Personal favorite for any Indian meal
The food here is well spiced, fresh, and cooked to perfection. It definitely lived up to the hype and has earned return visits and recommendations from me. The service was impeccable as well. This is a perfect restaurant for date night, special occasions, and to treat yourself. Their large drink menu also makes this an option for you to make a night of it with coworkers or friends.",1
5,"This is probably one of the best Indian restaurants I've ever been to in my life. 
I had to wait a bit for my table, so I went to the bar downstairs. The bartender was so patient when I was deciding on my drink. 
When I was seated and ready to order, my server talked me through my order. She knew what i wanted and figured I ordered wrong. She helped me and she was completely right. I devoured my meal in minutes because it was that good. I ordered naan, rice, and chicken. 
Next time I'm in London, I will definitely be coming back here",1
5,"Adding +spicy lamb chops and +bowl of greens to the list of things to order.
The staff/service here is incredibly welcoming/friendly, accommodating, and thoughtful. Even with a constant queue outside the door, the staff never rushed or pressured us. Definitely recommend eating here.",1
5,"The wait was a bummer but the food was worth the wait. Everything from the simple mixed greens,potatoes and onions to the lamb was mouth watering and very appetizing. The food was affordable, the ambiance was amazing and again the food was more than satisfying. Not to mention the staff was incredibly pleasant and friendly.  I recommend going during lunch to try and avoid the large line.",1
4,"This was one of our better meals while in London.
I had heard great things about Dishoom, so I bookmarked this restaurant prior to my trip to London. Unfortunately, the only time that I could visit was during the morning, so we opted to try the food prior to our trip to Buckingham Palace. 
Luckily, we got there before the brunch crowd, so we were able to be seated right away. The menu didn't have a ton of choices, but I decided on the Big Bombay breakfast, which included eggs, beans, sausage, bacon and some rolls. It was a relatively simple breakfast (and a lot of food), but everything was nicely cooked and flavorful. Paired with some orange juice, this was a good start to the day exploring London. I would definitely want to return, next time I am in London, to try dinner.",1
5,"This straight reminded me of some of the best indian food i tasted back in India. We went on a Sunday night and were in line for around 30 mins before they invited us in the bar area, followed by a proper table in the dining area in around 20 mins (total 50 mins)! We did not mind the wait. 
At the bar, we ordered Kala Khatta (non alcoholic drink,  mixed with  flavorful  spices, traditional to indian palette) and dishoom india pale. Both were great and we could not wait for the main course!
For main course, we ordered lamb samosas, pau bhaji, chicken ruby, garlic naan and roomali roti. Lamb samosas were 5/5 and Pau Bhaji may be a 4/5 (i have had better). They served samosas with three different chutneys, which was amazing! Chicken ruby was tender, juicy, rich in flavors, and lip smacking good! I literally could have wiped the plate clean! So good.
We ended the dinner with house tea, which was AMAZING!!
Can't wait to come back.",1
5,"This place is really good. A bit of a wait at peak times, but honestly worth it. This is some of the best Indian food around. Really nice atmosphere and great staff. I highly recommend coming here.",1
4,"My bf and I were touring London for 4 days and stumbled on this place on the first night. It was a Thursday and the line at 5PM was literally wrapped around the street. It was the longest line we'd ever seen, but it sure stirred some interest and we made a reservation for that weekend! From what we've heard from friends, it's not easy to get a reservation a few days away so we were pretty stoked. I think they take reservations until 5:30 so if you walk in before, there should be some open tables.
I'm giving 4/5 because I found the portions small, but it is advertised as ""small plates""/tapa style so it's an opportunity to try a bit of everything. We ordered the murgh malai, lamb kabab, and some garlic naan. Everything was really delicious!",1
5,"Indian food in London is a must and Dishoom did not disappoint. Started off with a Watermelon Sharbat followed by a Dishoom IPA while Boyfriend opted for the house chai with unlimited refills. All drinks were so good that I often found myself chugging them. For food we split the following and it was all delicious: Garlic Naan, Vegetable Samosas, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Mattar Paneer and a side of Basmati Rice. The vegetarian curry was my personal favorite. The reviews do not lie, Dishoom is where it is at. 
Tip: make reservations in advance or you will have to wait it out.",1
3,"This place was OK, but way overhyped. 
It is a well-decorated place, and the food was decent - but as expensive as it was (about £30-40 pp), and as long as the wait was (2 hours!!), I wouldn't do it again.
The ruby chicken was the best thing we'd ordered. The paneer tikka was the runner-up for me.",-1
4,"Ahhh. The only restaurant I HAD to dine in while in London! Long wait in line, a second wait downstairs, and finally!
Know this: veggie samosas were awesome. Sauces came out 5 min after samosas were delivered. 
Service was average. No smiles, just order and deliver food -service charge is automatic - water pitcher delivered to table of six was emptied by diners and not refilled. Foods are spicy - but very tasty!",1
5,"Best Indian food anywhere! The jackfruit biryani, okra fries, the bacon and egg naan roll! The food is amazing and there is an honesty in this amazing food. Go stand in line, it's worth the wait!",1
3,"Extremely overrated and I am shocked at all the glowing reviews. This Indian food was fine. In a city with a lot of good Indian food I didn't think it stood out at all. The restaurant is enormous. The service was very good, can't fault em for that. In fact overall Dishoom was totally decent, but I would never tell someone this is a must-go spot. If you're gonna wait for something special in London, I'd go to Hoppers.",-1
5,"The BEST Indian food I've ever had!!! My boyfriend is Pakistani and loves Indian food and agrees with that statement also!! So good we went back twice in less than 24 hours. 
Small plates: We had the okra fries, lamb samosas, and keema pau- all SO amazing. The keema pau is Iranian and was soooo delicious- the lamb is flavorful and a little oily, which makes it go perfectly with the homemade bun that goes with it (which is toasted to perfection!). 
Mains: between the two days we tried the chicken ruby (twice!!) which is basically their version of butter chicken. It is honestly the best butter chicken I've ever had. We also had the chicken berry biryani which was delicious- the berries gave it a nice and different flavor. We also had the house black daal which was delicious, and I'm a huge daal lover. My bf also had the dishoom chicken tikka roll was very tasty also. And of course we had garlic naan with it all!
Drinks: my bf tried the dishoom pale ale and thought it was really good! I also had the bollybellini which was very tasty, but definitely a sweet cocktail. I also had the baileys chai which was so delicious, perfect amounts of both and an amazing cream on top. 
Dessert: we had the dishoom chocolate pudding- so good!! It's more of a molten chocolate flourless cake, less like a traditional American pudding. It comes with a spicy chili ice cream which is so unique. Overall very delicious",1
5,"Had an amazing first Dishoom meal here recently, and very happy to recommend it to all. We came for breakfast, and I sincerely love the vibe and decor of the place. Our service was friendly and very attentive, and they kept the house chai flowing which was fantastic! We got the Kejriwal and the Keema Per Eedu. Both were quite tasty, especially the Keema (which had a stronger flavor). I was sad to not have enough stomach space to try out some of the naans. Most of all, I loved the decor - from all of the photographs, to even the decor in the restrooms, to the giant clock going backwards (""it's on Bombay time"" - our server) it really has a lovely atmosphere that feels special and unique.",1
5,"The hype is so real. We got there at an off time and waited 15 minutes for a table. The host even brought us lemonade to help ""beat the heat"" while we waited - delicious. 
We ate inside downstairs and ordered the chicken tikka, vegetable samosas, garlic naan,
prawns, and a meringue dessert, and tea.  Everything was exquisite. Possibly the best meal of my life.",1
5,"With so many great food options throughout London, it is amazing how crowded this place gets. Once you eat here, you will understand the clamoring to eat here.
My partner and I came early as to not wait in the line in the rain. The staff are very friendly and the restaurant is a great mix of classic London lobby restaurant and modern Indian bar. They have two floors of dining areas and patrons can wait at one of two bars if they are allowed to navigate the queue outside.
The first highlight of this dining experience were the cocktails. Unique, ethnic inspired cocktails are a great addition to delicious Indian food. The Viceroy Old Fashion (£9.50) and the East Indian Gimlet (£8) were the best drinks. In terms of the food, I would highly recommend house specials. The Pau Bhaji (£4.50) and the Daal (£6.20) were packed with flavor and were perfect for dipping breads. We split a lot of small dishes and this seemed to be a good method of enjoying lots of different dishes. It seemed like most tables were employing this tasting method.
Overall, this place is great. I have no complaints. I would recommend getting here early as the line was very long when we were ending our dining experience.",1
5,"Ate at dishoom over a year ago and I still think about my meal there. Amazing Indian food. Would recommend to anyone, especially those visiting London to eat here!!!!",1
5,"A unique Indian dining experience, far different from the more traditional restaurants I have experienced in the past. Dishoom creates a fresh, modern take on classic Bombay cuisine in a visually stunning ambiance. Gilded light fixtures, beautiful antique photos, dark wood details, and intricately tiled floors provide a glamorous fine dining vibe. The interior is enormous, with two floors of seating. This would be a good place to come with a large group. Service was elusive and difficult to summon, but the place is super hectic so we did not really mind. 
To drink I tried the Rose Lassi, which was delicious. Nice subtle floral flavors, and the perfect amount of sweetness. We shared the Gunpowder Potatoes and Bowl of Greens, both of which were simple, flavorful plant based sides that would compliment any entree. My main was the Jackfruit Biryani, which was excellent. The jackfruit was not shredded as I expected, but served as larger chunks in a bowl of rice. Richly spiced and deeply savory, the tender meat substitute provided a perfect contrast to the aromatic basmati rice. The trio of condiment sauces served on the side further enhanced the complex flavors-do not skip on adding these to your food. My boyfriend does not like Indian food (at all), and enjoyed his wrap. Lunch for two came to just around £45-a bargain considering the quality of ingredients and generous portions. I would not hesitate to recommend Dishoom.",1
5,"Indian food isnt usually the 1st thing I search for when looking for a place to eat. However, stumbled upon this restaurant and noticed that they had over 1000 reviews and almost 5 stars. So, i figured i can not NOT try it, and i am SO glad that i did!
Ws ordered a few things: cheesy toast (it was like eating a spicy indian cheesy bread - delish), butter bhutta (spicy corn with lime & salt - dont order this if you cant handle the tastes so good tho), chicken ruby (similar to butter chicken - yum), black daal (lentil), roti and rice. 
Everything we had were superb! If i lived in London, id visit this place frequently! Highly recommend!",1
5,"the hype is real. the food here was amazing so absolutely worth the wait. recommendations:
okra fries
bhel
roti
lamb samosas
chicken ruby
chicken & pomegranate 
the ambience is trendy, fun & full of culture.",1
5,"Make a reservation! The wait can get pretty ridiculous (2+ hours!), and you have to physically stand in line (I've seen it many times walking by). I mean, the food here is phenomenal and worth your time, but if you're visiting on vacation, you don't have all the time in the world to be spending it in line!!! Make a reservation! 
After 5:45pm, they only allow reservations for parties of greater than 6. However, if you have less than 6, you can still make a reservation for any time before 5:45pm. 
The inside is insanely hip and historic at the same time. I love the modern accents that feature decor that look like period-pieces from the 1920s. It also helps that you're greeted by the most aromatic and inviting smells as soon as you step foot into this establishment.
The food speaks for itself. You won't be disappointed by anything you order. Some of the food is so innovative and different, but not lacking at all in flavor. I was so surprised that the chicken tikka masala did not have sauce! The chicken pieces were just expertly soaked/braised/infused/whatever with the flavors that the sauce is still discernible, even if you're not seeing it. It's quite an incredible culinary feat, if you ask me. 
Also, I loved seeing the open kitchen downstairs. So efficient, spacious, and clean.",1
5,"Besides the hour and a half wait, the place is tasty.
Atmosphere is casual
Food is awesome
Buckle up for a long wait though. Sunday night was over 90 minutes 
Naan was delicious 
Grilled octopus 
Chicken curry
Paneer 
Grilled vegetables
All amazing and service was amazingly fast",1
3,The service was good.  I waited 35 minutes to find out as I was seated that they needed my table in 80 mins.  Fine I am an American diner who is pretty quick anyways.  Thought long and hard about the food tasty but a bit over rated.  I expect with all of the buzz this be the best Indian I have ever had.  Not the case.,-1
5,"I LOVED this place. I actually came here the day after going to The Cinnamon Club and was shocked that we got double the food for half the amount at Dishoom. Also, the quality was much better here!
First of all, they have a great waiting system. They gave us a remote that buzzes when your table is ready. When it buzzed, we went straight downstairs. I'm not sure what they use their upstairs for (maybe reservations) but they were directing all walk-ins downstairs. 
Second of all, the staff is amazing. Everyone that helped us was very kind. Our waitress, in particular, knew the menu very well and was very sweet. 
Third of all, the food was INCREDIBLE. I got a mango lassi and the Bedmi Puri. My dad got the Chicken Curry and an order of naan. They were both incredible and plenty of food for two people. The Chicken Curry, in particular, was very flavorful and pairs very well with both a Puri and naan. The mango lassi was my favorite part. It tasted just like we got it in India - very well done, sweet and tasty. 
I would recommend this place to everyone that visits London!",1
5,"I remember waiting outside in the cold for 1.5 hours, and then waiting in the basement bar area for another 45 minutes, before getting to eat, and nothing of what I actually ordered.  But this meal was still the highlight of my recent trip to London.  
Wow is all I can say.  Think of any positive adjective that could pertain to an eating establishment, this place has it in spades.  Well, maybe except for prompt.  After the fact the interminable wait itself didn't even register as a rite of passage, that's how good this place is.",1
5,"Amazing Indian Fusion.
Great food.  An expansive menu that is quite unique.  Great Service. Everyone from the greeters to the bartender to the hostesses were absolutely a pleasure to talk to and happy to give (very good) advice. Very long wait (we lined up outside for almost 2 hrs). I think it was well worth the experience.  Skipping Friday or Saturday night might be good to consider.  They don't take reservations after 6 pm.",1
5,"This restaurant was fantastic and everyone should find a way to eat here! If you are coming for lunch or dinner, my suggestion is to make a reservation. We came here for lunch on a Wednesday and arrived at 11:55 and just barely got a table for 2! The place was packed. 
We ordered:
-Rose & Pistachio Lassi (must order) 
-Pav Bhaji (must order) 
-Lamb Biriyani (must order but try the chicken instead)
-Ruby Chicken Curry
-Palak Paneer 
-Naan 
The food was all 5 stars. I highly recommend ordering the biriyani. It tasted just like my mom's homemade biriyani which takes 2 days to make- with the exception of Dishoom's lamb being a little tough and the cashews not being roasted. When I took my first bite, I was sent back 15 years to my childhood. It was incredible. Next time I come here I want to order the chicken biriyani. 
Now that I am back in Boston, I am craving that rose and pistachio lassi. As soon as it was served to me, I slurped it down in under 1 minute. The rose wasn't over powering at all and the lassi was light but had amazing flavor. 
Next time we are in London, we will definitely be back here! What was really nice too was that the whole restaurant is decorated with family memorabilia-even the bathroom stalls!",1
3,"Considering this was 4.5stars with over 1100 reviews, I was expecting a lot from this restaurant.  Even though this was 2 $$, it was still relatively expensive.  
Food/drinks ordered:
- Sweet & mango lassi: Dishoom did their own twist to the traditional lassi.  It's a bit more watered down and they added ice to the mixture as well.  The spices they added to the lassi are an acquired taste.  The mango lassi was actually more tangy than sweet.  
- Okra fries: This is actually pretty good.  Crispy and quite flavorful.  I liked 
- The black daal is their specialty, so I got this.  It was flavorful and tasty.  I wouldn't say it blew me away, but it was still good.
- Chicken ruby: tender and tasty.  Again, this is just average.
- The prawn mooli was really nice.  It was light and the prawns weren't overcooked. 
Overall, I didn't think there was anything special about the restaurant.  If I wanted exceptional Indian food for lunch, I'd go to Tamarind @ MayFair for lunch.",-1
5,"I don't just love this Indian restaurant, I really, really love this place. I am not a believer in standing in line for good food, especially in London, when there is so many good ones around every corner...but I have stood in line numerous times for this spot. Why? Because if you stand in line, at times they will bring you the most amazing chai to make it worth your while. Now in any other Indian restaurant, you are going to see your usual samosas, pakoras, naan, Tikka masala, etc...sure you will see those here, too, but this restaurant you will offer you things not offered elsewhere. The chili cheese toast for one is delicious...simple, with cheese and chives...I don't know why it is absolutely mind-blowing, but it is. Then, you get to the nitty gritty with the okra that is so crispy and always feels fresh. The roomali roti lives up to it's name by being handkerchief thin that you can inhale five before you realize.
Now don't forget to go downstairs to the bar and have the bartender whip you up some unique drinks or the very reliably yummy mango lassi. The wait staff could not be nicer. Rain or shine, and I hate the rain, I am willing to wait to eat at this restaurant...now that's saying something!",1
5,"great atmosphere, amazing food, best cocktails and really good service. Have been to Dishoom many times, and keep coming back every time.",1
4,"It's always consistently good and the service is great. 
I especially like the calamari and both chicken dishes.
Samosas On the other hand are nothing special.",1
5,"Trust me when I say the 60 min+ wait is totally worth it! We wanted to enjoy our last meal in London, so I suggested we do Indian since 1. it is popular in London and 2. it is our favorite cuisine to eat. We arrived here on a Monday night at 8:00pm and were told an hour wait. We got in the line and were immediately brought complimentary chai tea while we waited. Once we made it to the front of the line we were invited to have drinks and snacks at the bar downstairs. This was after about 30 minutes of waiting outside. We sat at stools near the bar but decided to just wait until seated to order any alcohol. About 10 minutes after we moved downstairs, we were shown to our dining table. 
Our server was very knowledgeable and happily shared suggestions and recommendations. Everything is served family-style and the portions are smaller so it's recommended 4-5 dishes for 2 people. We started with the lamb samosas, which come 3 per order. The outside was crisp and the lamb was well-seasoned and plentiful inside. We ordered the mahi tikka, adwahi lamb, and the ruby chicken along with 2 orders of garlic naan.
*Mahi tikka: this is sustainable Asian basa fillet in a subtle yoghurty marinade. This was a nice and light dish and tasted good with the extra lime. Even though this was good it was my least favorite and I let my husband eat most of it.
*Adwahi lamb: The lamb is prepared with stock and spices, then layered with rice and cooked in traditional 'dum' style. This was deliciously spicy! Really generous portion too. The lamb was well seasoned and tender.
*Ruby chicken: Tender chicken in a rich silky 'makhani' sauce. This was my favorite dish! Very rich and flavorful and creamy. Best mopped up with garlic naan! Lots of tender, well-flavored chicken mixed in.
*garlic naan: Some of the best garlic naan I've ever had! We ordered one order with butter and one without. I'm sure you can guess which was preferred at our table! The naan was soft and well-cooked and evenly flavored with garlic.
When visiting London, Indian food is always a solid option and look no further than Dishoom to provide a 5 star dining experience! From getting in line until walking out the door, we both felt well-taken care of and that we were valued customers.",1
5,Awesome place! Went there for date night! Love the food! Highly recommended! Very nice ambience and atmosphere. If you are in London and have a bit of liking for fusion Indian food.  You NEED to go here!,1
4,"Located in bustling Covent Garden, Dishoom is likely the most popular Indian restaurant in all of London. 
1. What is the restaurant like? 
Dishoom offers a nice ambience that caters to a diverse patron base: families, friend groups, and significant others on a special date. Upstairs and downstairs seating is available. 
2. What is the wait like?
On a Wednesday evening at 7:30 pm, we were quoted a 1 hr wait. We expected that we would have a chance to explore the area after putting our names down, but Dishoom requires that all customers wait in line. To placate hungry customers in line, the restaurant offers warm chai tea and small bites. 
3. What should you order?
According to our waiter, the restaurant's famed dishes are the chicken ruby, prawns, house black daal, and calamari. 
We ordered several dishes suggested by our waiter including the calamari, chicken ruby, house black daal, spicy lamb chops, bowl of greens, cheese naan, and garlic naan. The calamari was a nice starter that we enjoyed with the various dips, especially the spicy house sauce. Among the other plates we ordered, our favorite was the chicken ruby, which was pleasantly less creamy than the chicken tikka masala that we are accustomed to but loaded with just as much flavor. It served as the perfect accompaniment to the naan. We liked the other plates that we ordered, though we would have preferred the spicy lamb chops to have been cooked a tad less longer. Overall, we were extremely happy with our meal and left with content bellies. 
Dishoom was a fantastic first meal upon our arrival in London, and we would undoubtedly return.",1
5,"Everyone always said London had some world-class Indian food, but I was skeptical as to how much it outstripped the States in this regard until I actually came. 
Dishoom is a wildly popular Indian restaurant with many locations throughout the city. My friend and I chose to visit the Covent Garden one as it was most convenient for us. We secured ""lunch"" reservations for 5:45PM, effectively making this an early dinner (and this is the way to go as they don't take dinner reservations, and the line was out the door for walk ins while we were seated immediately; the lunch and dinner menu are the same).
We ordered the garlic naan, chicken ruby, and black house daal to share - a greatest hits of the menu, if you will. Everything was phenomenal, with depths of flavor that I never tasted before in Indian food, all melding together with none of the harsh notes that I've sometimes found NYC Indian food suffers from. Somehow even the naan was orders of magnitude better than the ones I've had in the US.
Both of us loved the restaurant so much that we had to come back the next morning to try breakfast (and more lunch). We arrived and were seated immediately at ~11:15. My friend and I ordered a keema per eedu, breakfast lassi, and bottomless house chai. Everything was, once again, phenomenal. The keema is quite heavy and comes with two buttered buns. Even something as simple as the chai was great - I'd never understood the appeal of it until I had a glass here.
Of course, we also had to order off the lunch menu once they started taking orders at 11:45 since it was our last day. For that, we split the roti, chicken ruby (again), and the pau bhaji. Once again, everything was amazing and we cleaned our plates. For dessert, we each had a kulfi, which was a nice, light way to end a large meal.
Please bring Dishoom to NYC! Until then, I'll be dreaming about this place.",1

We decided we should have at least one Indian meal in London before going home so we found this restaurant on Yelp (thank you!!). We arrived around 7:45 and the wait was a full hour, outdoors. They serve you a nice warm chai tea while waiting, which was lovely. I really wasn't sure what to expect as we peered through the windows watching people eat. It looked rather crowded from the outside peeking in but it's actually huge and there's a whole bottom floor with more seating.
I took one bite of the curry and completely understood why people wait an hour out in the cold and rain to eat at this place. It was hands down the best curry I've had anywhere in the world, including India and Thailand. I'm usually pretty good at guessing ingredients in dishes but I had no idea what they put in here to make it so amazing. The rest of the food was also very good, including the lentils, which I don't usually like. The lentils had a nice texture, not mushy like what I've had in the past. If we had more time in London, I would have come back here just to eat the curry again- it was that good.",1
5,"I love the train station aesthetic here. Get the ruby chicken and the fried okra fries. Authentic Indian food that's at a reasonable price. Great spice level, not too hot.",1
5,"London is known for its Indian food, but it should be known for this place specifically!
The long wait, around 40 mins, was well worth it. We ordered drinks to pass the time, which were delicious.
My boyfriend ordered for us, as he grew up with this cuisine. The naan was perfect, the sauces perfectly spicy or sweet, the greens seasoning were delicious, and the lamb/chicken plates were perfect. We kept ordering more and it seemed like we couldn't go wrong! 
Spiked chai was a nice end to the meal, and the service was great.",1
5,"I don't normally eat Indian food so I was a bit skeptical when my coworker said he wanted to come here. BUT this place was so good! I am so happy I came here. The line was long when we first got there but it moved up pretty quickly.
Food: 
Okra Fries - 
Dishoom Calamari
Lamb chops
Dishoom Chicken Tikka
Murgh Malai 
Kulfi
Drinks: Moscow Mule and Kingfisher beer
Everything was soooo delicious so it was difficult to choose a favorite but I think I liked the Okra Fries and Murgh Malai most. I would definitely come here again the next time I'm in London. Service was excellent and the atmosphere was also very nice. Price was pretty reasonable as well. Definitely recommend this place.",1

5,"Delicious!!! It's our last night in London and Indian food was on our must try list. 
There was a long line to get in (recommend making a reservation) - was estimated an hour wait, but the wait was less than 30 minutes. My husband and I had the fried okra, garlic naan, ruby chicken, tikka masala and roasted potatoes. Definitely would eat here again if we come back!",1
5,Really great find.  Had been here years ago and took my husband there when we visited London. We both loved it.,1
5,"It seems like dishoom grew in popularity since I last visited in 2014 and I'm not surprised! My friends and family have heard me rave about it for years and I still stand by the fabulous menu! My husband and I visited the covent garden location on a Friday evening back in April - literally during peak dinner hours. I knew we would have about a 2 hour wait so we made sure to have a snack beforehand. Loved that the host outside was handing out piping hot glasses of chai, it helped make the wait in the rain a little better. 
We were finally seated in the downstairs dining area and it was bustling with people, just as I remember it on Friday evenings. When I was in grad school, dishoom was my weekly indulgence of Indian street food and I had the menu memorized forward and backwards. I liked seeing that most of my favorites were still on the menu - black dal, gunpowder potatoes, paneer tikka and murgh malai. We tried a new dish this time, which I really enjoyed as well, the goan shrimp curry. Everything tasted fresh and so delicious! I still feel like this is some of the best Indian food you can find in London!",1
3,"We were told the wait would be an hour. They served us hot chai and sherry while we waited in line. It was maybe 20 mins before we were allowed inside to sit and wait for another 15 minutes at the bar. I had the BollyBellini - would not recommend, extremely sweet. Once we were seated, our server came over to explain the menu to us a bit. Due to the combination of the noise level in the restaurant with the velocity and volume of our sever's voice, I couldn't decipher what he was saying. 
Our food was good. The Mahi Mahi tikka was the best. The Chicken Tikka was super spicy. The server was busy and therefore the customer service lacked. When we were finished, he cleared our plates and we advised him that we didn't want dessert. We waited 20 mins at our seats for our check. We had to track him down to ask for it. We paid cash and were waiting for our change, he took our cash and disappeared for another 10 minutes. Overall the service really killed our experience, which is why I must give this restaurant a 3/5.",-1
5,"It was highly recommended that I try this place and someone even went as far as saying it was some of the best Indian food in the world. This recommendation did not disappoint, everything we got was absolutely delicious! The chicken ruby was tender, creamy, and perfectly sauce. The Black daal was perfectly coked lentils, the seasoning was amazing and  didn't even need the rice to soak it up. The naan was perfectly crispy and garlicky. We might have had to wait an hour to get seated, but it was completely worth it!",1
5,The naan was so good! This place was Recommended by my local London friends and I'm so happy we came. Service was quick and the food was delicious! Would definitely return.,1
4,"It was my first time here and it is also my friend's favorite place.  We were early to beat the lines, so we had breakfast.  The atmosphere was very lively and open, very welcoming.  They have a downstairs as well that's a little more intimate.  The interior design is well put also - modern vs authenticity.  
We both had the bacon naan roll and it was delish!  I had also ordered the fire toast, but it wasn't anything special.  Just toast, but the home-made preserves: pineapple-pink-peppercorn jam, and tangy orange marmalade with star anise was yummy!
My friend really loved the dinner menu and wanted me to try AND only another 30 mins till dinner menu, soooooooooooooooooooooooo we decided to stay!!!!  We took our time eating and chatting.  I had ordered the house chai and that was great decision, plus free refills!!  The lassi with fennel was something else, quite refreshing.  
When it was time to order, again, I ordered the Ruby chicken with rice....make that two!!!  We had the same thing again and it did not disappoint.  I truly enjoyed it.  Boy were we stuffed!  But good and satisfying stuffed.  I would love to come back again, but I'm 5600 miles away now! 
Thanks for the great experience!",1
1,"Went to check out what the hype was about! It was a Monday evening n we reached the place at 7 pm.. there was a long queue and these guys don't take reservations. We were told the wait time is an hour and 20 mins! Stood in the queue n were finally ushered in. We got a table in the noisy basement. It was already too crowded n too loud. For the next 10 mins, 3 servers came around n asked if we want water, but no one served it until we placed the order n requested again for water. The service could be much better for the price.
Please start taking reservations when you know it gets busy.",-1
5,"Absolutely delicious! Wonderful flavors, great service and new and interesting dishes to try! Make sure to get the chai.",1
4,"Food: 4.0/5.0
Service: 3.5/5.0
Value: 3.5/5.0
Decor: 3.5/5.0
Overall: 4.0/5.0
I was half expecting something completely amazing but half expecting to be disappointed with my first Dishoom experience given the general accuracy of Yelp but then also the reputation of cuisine in this city.  Lo and behold, Dishoom came in smack in between - the food was indeed done quite well, and I think there is price that the proprietors can take but choose not to.  However, I would posit that the rating would be just a tad lower in certain other cities.  #true",1
3,"The line up was an hour long so was it was it? In my opinion, no. Overall it was ok but I just don't see what the hype is about.
You can tell it was full of tourists that come because the number of reviews.
We had the fried okra and calamari for starters then the dahl which was good, the lamb chops which tasted a tad burnt then the cheese panner which had a nice tomato tasting sauce. The namm is a small portion.
The place a machine, in and out.",-1
5,"We started with the fried okra and I found it perfectly crisp and delightfully tasteful. I also got the garlic naan to start and I enjoyed that as well. For my main, I got the Marsala prawns which were grilled to perfection.  We also tried the chicken ruby which melts on your mouth. The spices are unique and fresh. Loved the atmosphere and vibe here. Be prepared for a long wait in line. We came at 10:00 and waited about 15-20 mins. Regular wait times during their busy hours can be any where from 1-2 Hours. Attentive staff. Lovely!",1
4,"Would you wait for 1 hour in horrid weather to get Indian food? Well, we did. So this was apparently supposed to be the best Indian place in London and I figured I had to try it on my weekend visit. Got there at 6 pm and the place had a huge line outside. No, they do not let you put your name on the list and go for a stroll. You have to stand in the line, rain, wind or shine. They do bring you chai and sherry while you're waiting though.
Once inside, the ambiance was beautiful. They have amazing Indian decor. We ordered the chicken ruby, dal makhani, kheema pav and roomali roti. Every thing was spot on except Chicken ruby. Chicken ruby was sweet for my taste. Service was good and prices were very affordable.",1
4,"What a lunch feast to remember! Came here with a group of 10 for lunch a couple weeks ago and had the most amazing time. We had originally wanted to come for dinner, but couldn't get a a dinner reservation for any Dishoom in London! But lunch was excellent, and it's nice that they save a good chunk of their tables for walk-ins. Our server was very patient, kind, and attentive. She explained many dishes to us and gave us excellent recommendations. We ordered family style so I got to try a bit of everything. I had the:
Rose & Cardamom Lassi: so good!!! Very refreshing and I loved the rose flavor. A perfect complement to all the spices. 
Cheese Naan: oh my gosh, so much cheesy goodness!!! The cheese was plentiful and beautifully melted and the naan had a nice moisture to it. Definitely wish we had ordered more of this.
Chicken Ruby: yum!!!! This is so much less creamy and better than the chicken tikki masala I am used to getting in the States. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce was so delicious.
 
Awadhi Lamb: some of my friends loved this, but It wasn't one of my favorites. The lamb flavor was a little too strong (does that even make sense?) for me.
Keema Pau: same feelings as with the Awadhi--I just couldn't get behind the lamb here.
Dishoom Slaw: a little too much sauce, but it was nice to have something to cool down my mouth.
Bowl of Greens: greens! Yay! Simple bowls of vegetables that went well with all the sauce and meat we had.
Black House Daal: people loved this dish, and they're known for making it. I personally thought it was too sweet.
Okra Fries: reminded me of some Southern-fried food. A little too oily (but I always feel this way about fried vegetables), but nice to nibble on.
Dishoom Calamari: this was delicious! Nice, light, a little sweet, and with the tiniest of kicks to get your senses going.
Pau Bhaji: solid vegetarian dish. Loved the simple flavoring. Not as much of a fan of the bread, but that's probably because the Cheese Naan blew me away.
Fantastic service, great ambiance, and very affordable prices. Can't wait to come back!",1
5,The gold standard of Indian food. Great customer service. Long line but so worth the wait. Definitely returning!,1
3,"Average and overrated! Perhaps my expectations were too high or maybe it's because we had breakfast but I didn't find this place particularly exciting. I'll most likely come back just as a follow up as I clearly must have missed something. But $7.50 USD for a piece of naan with bacon inside seems ridiculous. My fiancé ended up getting the Bombay omelette which was a little more filing and interesting but I was completely underwhelmed by the bacon naan wrap. I did observe other people get the bacon with egg which seems to give you a piece of naan that's twice of big. Looking back, perhaps I got the wrong item but the bacon naan is the suggested favorite on their menu.
I will comment that their service was super on point though and that the atmosphere and decor were very nice and fitting.",-1
5,"Wife found this place on Yelp which has over a thousand reviews and 4.5 stars. After several Tube rides we got here and was told the wait would be an hour. However we waited only about 40 minutes and was seated. While in line we chatted with a family from Seattle who had been there and loved it, and highly recommend the fried okra appetizer. They were right about the restaurant being worth the wait and about the okra! We ordered Chicken Ruby which was like chicken Tikka masala, and it was super delicious. We also ordered another curry and it was good, but not as good as the orange curry. We also ordered lamb and chicken tandoori and both were flavorful and tender without being dry. The plain and garlic naan were great to dip the curry. Overall a delicious experience, definitely recommended and definitely will return next time we are in London!",1
3,"After a 1.5 hour wait in a slowly moving line, we made it in (on a Wednesday evening)... lots of hype about the amazing food, and honestly it was unique- Anglo-Indian food, but not worth the wait...
Authentic it's not...
Service was great, very loud in there so don't expect to hear each other- and really by the time you get in all you want to do is sit down and eat so probably ok that it's not the spot to catch up!!!",-1
4,"Wow. I don't really eat Indian food much or at least, I'm not an expert on it, but wow. Dishoom was one of the highlights of my trip to London and, the food and service I received were worth the long lines.
As everyone else is saying, I would recommend coming early to avoid the wait. I came a little before 6:00 pm and had to wait almost 45 minutes - mind you, I was by myself. The waitresses will also provide you with a little hot drink (chai tea?) while you wait outside. Good thing some fellow Americans were also waiting in line; they told me what to try and order as I had no idea what to get. They recommended me the Chicken Ruby with some Naan and a side of Basmati Rice. I also ordered a delicious and sweet Mango & Fennel Lassi. Everything was tasty. The Chicken was flavorful, rich, and deliciously spiced. The Naan and Rice complemented the Chicken and the sauce perfectly. Oh, and the dips...! Amazing. For 1 person, that was a lot of food. Plus, the service was exceptional. 
Would I recommend it? Of course. If you're visiting London for the first time, Dishoom is definitely a place to try!",1
3,"ok so this is tough.Im from NY where theres no shortage of good indian food. Now orginally my wife and i were going to head to DUM biryani house but saw the greaaat reviews and number of reviews for DISHOOM. So i ll go thru pros and cons
PROS- ambience is amazing. The lighting the old indians photos were superb touch
The cocktails honestly were the best part of the entire experience.  I had an excellent manhattan and my wife a colada. So no issues there. Service was great. All employees were friendly.  
To the food. Best dish we had was the chicken tikka off the grill. Tender and flavorful and with the chutney selection you could make as spicey or mild as needed
Mattar paneer was good with excellent flavors and one of there signature dishes the black dhal was on point i must say.
Cons- spicy lamb chops, first werent spicy and second they were overcooked. Cmon man there should be some red. 
We also got the signature prawn moilee in a yellow curry and it was just OK man.  I mean the shrimp was a bit over cooked. I wouldnt even say they were prawns. It wasnt bland but i did have high expectations. My wife ordered some coleslaw and felt the yogurt in their mightve been old. 
To summarize id say its a good place overall but if your expecting curries like some tikka masala vindaloo or saag .. yea not here. I mean im torn, i think people will enjoy the overall experience in general but really if youve been to other indian restuarants around the world this isnt even top 5 food wise. 
Go enjoy and have drinks and other small plates and judge for urself",-1
5,"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. Came upon this place through a recommendation and was very pleased to have the opportunity to check it out. Went for a late dinner and arrived around 9:25pm. Even at that hour there was a line 30 minutes deep, but the wait didn't seem so bad as the friendly staff handed out complimentary fruit (grapes and dates) and drinks (chai and mint teas). 
Upon getting to the front of the line, you are given a buzzer and directed downstairs to the bar, where you can order drinks and snacks while you wait. Got the Bollybellini, a tasty fruity concoction, and waited no more than a few moments until the host seated us. They were more than accommodating when my companion and I wanted to switch to a different (read: bigger) table.
Our server Ali was as friendly as could be and even gave us some great recommendations/suggestions. Between us two, we got the vegetable samosas to start (which we ended up getting an extra order of halfway through our meal -- yes, it was THAT good!) along with the Dishoom chicken tikka, spicy lamb chops, Butter-Bhatta, the Black House Daal, garlic naan, and steamed basmati rice. I could have just gotten the Daal with basmati rice and I would have been a happy camper, tbh. But really, everything was delicious and very flavorful! The garlic naan could have used a little more garlic flavor, but other than that, everything was superb! 
Aside from the great food and very attentive, helpful and friendly staff, the prices are reasonable. I would note that this place is more on the trendy side and the size of the dishes are similar to tapas style. Would definitely come back here the next time I'm in London! Already itching to try the Chicken Ruby and the Mahi Tikka. Again, Ali was an amazing server if you're lucky to get him, and really the whole staff was just top notch!!",1
5,"Before we embarked on our trip to London, literally everybody we spoke to said we had to try Dishoom. With hype comes the slight chance of disappointment if it doesn't deliver, but guys, the Dishoom hype is real! 
We ordered the ruby chicken, which by the way, was so good we ordered two! It was basically a flavor explosion of zesty tomato and coconut creaminess. We paired that with cheese naan which you should absolutely order. 
We finished that off with the okra fries ( which I would trade for French fries any day, and that's saying a lot!). The entire meal at Dishoom was so memorable that I still dream about it from time to time :)",1
4,After standing in line for over an hour we were finally granted entrance into Dishoom. The restaurant is loud and lively on weekends. We were taken downstairs and ordered drinks. Unfortunately I don't remember all the names of the dishes we had. We tried two different appetizers one being behel (perhaps wrong spelling) it was delightful. I had the lamb biryani which they said was spicy but wasn't really spicy at all. My friend had a yummy chicken dish which also wasn't spicy. I would say this place is worth the wait. The food and atmosphere but are worth the wait.,1
5,"Such a great place! There was a huge wait outside for dinner (45min) but they came out and brought us drinks and little aperitifs. They have a dedicated gluten free menu and the staff is very well informed on the allergies. The cocktails were really good, if you can't find something on the menu, the barkeeper will make you something based on your taste. The food was absolutely amazing. It was served tapas style so you don't have to commit to one meal and even though it was super busy our food came in a very timely manner. 
Highly recommend this to satisfy any cravings for Indian food!",1
4,"Waited 1.5hr on a Sunday night to get seated with 3 friends.  They came out with comp shots of lemonades and dates and grapes which was nice.
We ordered fried okras, the far far (like prawn crackers texture) and Dishoom calamari (breaded fried calamari) for appetizers.  The fried okras were so good we ordered a 2nd one!
My friends ordered the chicken ruby, chicken berry Britannia with biryani rice and prawn curry.  I had the Murgh Malai (marinated grilled chicken thigh meat).
All dishes were flavorful.  The flavor of the biryani rice dish with the sweet berries tasted very good.  The Murgh Malai pieces were tender wth wonderful flavor.
Would I come back to eat?  Yes - if I don't have to wait for 1.5hr.  That really took it out of us standing there (luckily it was a nice balmy night).",1
4,"I didn't think Indian food would one of my favorite meals in London, but it was! Dishoom is London's first Bombay cafe, and it lives up to the hype.
My friends and I arrived around Dishoom on an afternoon around 2 PM, and luckily, we only had to wait about 30 minutes.
We ordered the following:
- Pau Bhaji (mashed vegetables with pau buns) - This was our appetizer to start, and it was delicious! It was flavorful with a slightly spicy kick, and it came with hot buttered buns to dip in the mashed veggies. 
- Spicy lamb chops - Deliciously spiced and well-cooked! The lamb was tender yet crispy on the edges, and it didn't taste gamey at all to me!
- Dishoom Chicken Tikka - Chicken tikka is one of my favorite Indian dishes, so we had to try this. It was a little sweeter than I expected, but still good nonetheless. 
- House black daal - This was like a thick and hearty lentil soup. Creamy with great flavors. 
- Plain naan, garlic naan, cheese naan - Naan is a MUST at any Indian restaurant. They were all good, though the cheese was interesting since it's not a traditional naan flavor. I do wish the garlic naan tasted more garlicky and the cheese naan had more cheese though. 
- Roomali roti - The roti was recommended to us to pair with the chicken. I didn't think the roti was anything too special though. Texture-wise, it was like a super thin tortilla. I preferred pairing all the dishes with the naan.
- Yogurt - Another recommendation from the waiter. This helped cut some of the intensity of the otherwise strong flavors of the other dish, so I thought it was a nice balance.
- House sauces - The waiter brought out 3 house chutneys/dipping sauces (tamarind, mint, sweet chili?), which were delicious. The chili one paired REALLY well with the naan and other dishes - so much so that was had to ask for more!
We also ordered the Bombay presidency punch to share (a bowl of jaggery, lime, Darjeeling tea and Ceylon Arrack), and it was amazing! It may be a bit dangerous, since it tastes so good and refreshing that you might just forget it's alcoholic. Our waiter actually forgot to put our order in until we asked halfway through our meal. By the time we got it, we were almost done eating, we so just sat there a while sipping some ""punch."" 
Overall, it was a fun, delicious, and flavorful meal with great ambiance and excellent service too! If you're in the area, I'd recommend having a meal here!",1
3,"My husband and I had lunch at this location the other day.  We arrived just before noon.  We did not have a reservation, but the hostess said that was no problem.  She would seat us at the end of a long table for 10 people, but said she would need it back by 1:30.  This was not an issue for us, but it did seem a bit odd.  I've only been to a few places that have told me I can have a table for a limited amount of time, but most of the time it is because the restaurant is so amazing that they are overbooked, so although in one sense it bothered me, in another sense I was now even more excited to eat here because, dang this place must be good.  
For drinks my husband ordered a watermelon cooler which he described as a watermelon mojito, no alcohol.  I was debating between a chai and a lassi.  I love both, but I have a tendency to fill up on lassis before my food arrives.  However, there was a guy at another table with this gorgeous pink drink.  When I asked the server what it was and he said the rose and cardamom lassi, I knew I had to have it.  To be honest, it was my favorite thing I consumed at this meal.  It was heavenly.  It had just the right amount of sweetness and the a gorgeous flavor of roses, but it did sort of fill me up.  
For entree my husband ordered the lamb chops.  He saw a thousand things he wanted to order on the menu and was having a terrible time deciding, but once I started showing him pictures on Yelp he knew that is what he wanted and he said they were incredible.  I'm not super into red meat right now.  My pregnancy has largely turned me off to most red meat,  but they did look gorgeous.
  I ordered the chicken ruby.  Here's my issue, it was one of only 2 curries on the menu.  I mean it is kind of cool to go to an Indian restaurant that has different stuff and when we were in India most restaurants had curries, and tandoori, and biriyani, but I really felt like 2 curries was a super limited selection.  There was no korma, xacuti, vindaloo, madras, etc.  For my personal taste this lack of selection of sauces was a bummer.  
The chicken ruby was very good, but far from the best I've ever had.  It tasted like butter chicken to me.  The spicy flavor didn't kick in until the very last minute.  I ordered it with basmati rice which was fine, but in no way special, and roti, which again was fine, but not special.  
With his lamb my husband ordered the black daal which everyone raved about and we found to be lackluster.  These were far from the best lentils we've ever had.  
The atmosphere of the restaurant was a bit odd too.  We sat upstairs and I am glad we did.  When I went downstairs it was like a whole different restaurant.  It was loud, crowded and cramped.  The upstairs was a bit like that, but not to that extent.  
Finally, the prices were a bit steep as well.  After, Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, this was the second most expensive meal we ate in London, so it is pretty pricey.  We definitely enjoyed it, but I don't think we enjoyed it that much and for all those who say this place is worth the wait, I am going to have to politely disagree.  Again, it is good, but it is not outstanding.  Perhaps I am spoiled by my vast selection of Indian at home or by the fact that I have traveled and spent time in India.  I had really high expectations for Indian food in London and this didn't really meet them.",-1
4,"We tried the lamb samosas, chicken Ruby (a red curry), grilled prawns, a couple of cocktails, and garlic naan of course. It was good. The ambiance was good. Definitely a crowd favorite this one. At least I can say I've eaten Indian food while in London. 
But then again, I do believe I've eaten my fair share of really, really great Indian dishes in my neck of the woods (that is, Phoenix, Arizona). Go figure. 
This is a nice place to take your date to, but I
imagine you'd be good enough to look for better, less expensive Indian places soon after that first date (if you and your companion hit it off and both appreciate Indian food at its best).",1
5,"Never fails to surprise and delight. It doesn't matter how long the wait is. Dishoom runs a tight queuing operation! 
Lamb is always good, as is the chicken ruby. Love the black daal as well.",1
4,"This was a place I had bookmarked for dinner one night but ended up not going until we wanted breakfast this morning and this place was recommended. My fiancé is not a fan of Indian food so that was another reason we didn't come here for dinner. We did walk by on a Friday night and there was a queue to get in and it seemed like quite a long one. 
Anyway, I ordered a chocolate chai since it was a little brisk this morning. It was perfectly warm and it had all the aromas that you would look for in a chai... if drinks could give you a warm fuzzy hug, this drink would be the one to do it. 
For our meals, we went with the naan wraps with egg. I got the sausage one and he got bacon (extra crispy). While it was good, it was not anything to write home to. His bacon was not crispy to start with - maybe some burnt edges. I gave him half of my sausage naan roll and I got half of his bacon naan roll. 
I want to come back here for dinner one day as I really enjoy Indian food. In the meantime, I will have to convince Brian's tastebuds that they like Indian food.",1
4,"Our party of four came around on a Saturday at around 6, expecting a wait. The line didn't look too long but in reality, it was a 1.5 hour wait. Their waiting system is actually pretty orderly. It's like getting into a nightclub. They have ropes (non-velvet) and have people line up. I'm not sure if this is just to make it look like it's poppin', because there were quite a few empty tables inside. Maybe they were for people who made reservations (only available for groups of 6+). While you're waiting, a waitress comes around and gives you small samples of hot chai tea latte. It was a bit too sweet for me, but it was a very nice gesture, especially since it was windy and chilly that day.
Finally, once you get inside the exclusive Dishoom, you'll wait about 15 more minutes while they prepare your table. That's how they get you to order a drink at the bar downstairs. So I had the Chilitini (Luksusowa vodka with pomegranate, lemon juice and chilli liqueur) and for 7.50, it was pretty inexpensive for a cocktail (compared to NYC, anyway). I really liked the flavor and the bite that the chili liquer gave it, but I wish there was a bit more vodka in it. I guess I'm just used to stronger NYC cocktails, where they don't measure out the liquor.
Onto the food. Here is what we ordered:
Garlic Naan - our waiter recommended two orders for four people, but I'm glad that we didn't go with his suggestion. It was very oily, so it would have been difficult for one person to eat more than a certain amount of it. Could have used more garlic.
Lamb Boti Kabab (pieces of tender lamb marinated with red chilli, garlic and ginger) - the flavor was good but the lamb was pretty dry. It definitely needed some sauce with it.
House Black Daal (Indian spiced lentils) - this was like a soupy bean dip. Not my favorite but it went well with the garlic naan
Chicken Ruby (chicken in a rich silky 'makhani' sauce) - this was probably the star of the show, as it seems like the majority here would agree. The sauce is great (again, especially with the naan), and the chicken wasn't dry.
Note - none of the 'entrees' come with any sides so you'll want to order naan or rice to go with it. The portions are on the smaller side so it's best to order a bunch of dishes and just share them. That way, you'll get to have a great variety.
I don't know how packed their other locations get. I also don't know if I would wait another 1.5 hours to eat here again. But I do know that it was a great London Indian food experience.",1
5,"Be prepared for a terribly long wait! We waited about 1.5 on a Saturday night to try this gem out. As visitors in London, we had to experience this popular place for ourselves and I wouldn't say I regret it at all. Best Indian/Pakistani cuisine in London hands-down. Food was delicious-perfectly seasoned, fresh and authentic. We got the ""recommended popular"" dishes- if it is your first time I'd go with their recs too. Chicken Ruby, Garlic Naan, Spicy Lamb Chops and a beef/goat curry (forgot the name but ask them for the popular curry dish). All the items were exceptional and satisfying. Get these items and thank me later!
Definitely worth the wait and the calories, in my opinion.",1
5,"LOVED EVERY BIT OF MY EXPERIENCE HERE.
Just a couple of blocks away from where Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was showing, managed to eat here on my last night in London before going up to Scotland the next morn. It was a chilly November night and I waited outside in a short queue to get in. I think I waited about 30min but I heard it was worth it so I stayed. I know other reviews said that the staff came out with fresh hot chai to keep the guests warm as they wait but no chai that night. 
Finally inside lead to go downstairs by the bar area which I find really intimate and fun and dim. The downstairs also had a dining area versus the main floor. There at the bar, another 10-15min until they call you for the table. It was quick for me because I was dining solo.
Ordered the usual mango lassi, chicken tikka masala, basmati rice, garlic naan and dessert. UFF. SO. GOOD. The staff were very attentive of me and other guests. Probably ended up spending 40 quids but I still love it! Everyone should gooo! I know I will the next time I'm in London!",1
3,"Well if you don't mind dining in the most modest of furnishings, a table and a chair between babies in strollers galore with noisy conditions--- and you like your meat well done & not succulent; and you are easily swayed into ordering 'extras' at the insistence of waiters speaking broken English, then DISHOOM is just the place for you! 
Me? I'm not planning a return visit.",-1
5,"Several friends and I were out late at night in London when they suggested indian food and being in london where indian food is supposed to be the best, of course I was down. Stupid me tho thought this was going to be a quick and dirty meal or a buffet style like they have in the states but boy was I wrong...and gladly so! We didn't end up having it that night since I soon realized how popular of a place Dishoom is but upon entering and smelling the wonderful aromas of food I decided that we absolutely HAD to come back to try this place before we left for home!
We were able to get a quick seat coming to this location for lunch around 11 and we ordered basically everything that was popular on the menu and that our waiter suggested! We got the chicken ruby, pau bhaji (10/10) would recommend, garlic naan, house black daal, and lamb shanks (not a lamb fan usually, but would also def recommend. the pomegranate seeds are a unique touch). for the three of us, we honestly planned to order so much more food since it is served tapas style but our waiter warned us (so sorry I forgot his name but he was wonderful!) that it would be a lot and he was definitely right, we were SO full!
The decor of this place was adorable and everything is so nicely presented. it's also priced really well for the food you get! I will DEFINITELY be back on my next trip across the pond, I already miss it SO much just typing this!!",1
4,"Dishoom definitely lives up to the hype!  Knowing London has some of the best Indian food in the world, I did my research before visiting from Las Vegas - which is by no means a hot-bed of 5-star Indian restaurants!  
We ordered  Chicken Ruby = Dishoom's take on Tikka Masala, Garlic naan, and Roti (which reminded us of a large Mexican tortilla).  Everything was fantastic!  Highly recommended!",1
5,"What a meal!  Plate sharing indian food at its finest!
I took my parents and siblings here, many of who do not normally eat indian food.  With my guidance, they all were blown away at how tasty (and not mouth burning) all the dishes were!
Cocktails were also very well done.
Waits seem to be very long here at times, so if you catch it with a short line go for it!",1
4,"An inviting window into Parsi culture. Eating here was a pleasant experience. We arrived late on a weeknight and the restaurant was still packed when we got there. 
The Art Deco flourishes give the space the feel of another time and place. 
The kabobs were meaty and well spiced. We also ordered biryani. 
The rice was aromatic and complemented the meat dishes nicely. Would also recommend the roti.",1
5,"Amazing Indian food! Gah, never in my life have I waited in line for Indian food. Insane!
But you know it's good if there's a wait... even at 4:30pm. My fiance and I waited over an hour to eat here!
Like other Yelpers mentioned, after you line up in front of the door, the host takes you to the bar. I think it's kind of a dirty trick to get customers to spend money on drinks while they wait to get seated at the table. That rubbed me off the wrong way.
On to the food... you must get the ruby chicken. The menu is so extensive, but we LOVED the ruby chicken, garlic naan, and one of the chicken skewers.
I will definitely return with reservations next time!",1
5,"This restaurant server the tastiest dish we had experienced in our trip to London! It is Indian-British fusion, so the dishes were very imaginative. The naan wrap was excellent and I would highly recommend it.",1
4,"I like the food dishoom has but the wait times tend to be ridiculous so would I Walt to eat the food there? No, but if there is no wait I'll gladly eat there 
The garlic Naan, paneer Tikka and paneer vegetable happen to be my favorite but come on guys, you need to add a malai kofta or something to your vegetarian menu",1
5,"100% would recommend. I already know that I will be coming to this restaurant every time I am in London - maybe even more than once on any given trip. The chicken biryani with raita was so good. I can't even comprehend how the rice was so, so good. I've lived in India and had a lot of Indian food, this stuff is amazing! My friends live in London and have been here multiple times. Everything they have had has been amazing.
Reservations only for groups of 6+. Worth the wait though!",1
3,"Not what I expected. Didn't like the decor or the food. I am very generous and always give the benefit of the doubt but felt like they wanted us out if there as it was nearing closing time but then they should adjust their timings not rush paying customers.
To top that our order was wrong and told them mild coz of my young child and the food cane our spicy.
Not going there again.",-1
5,Absolutely lovely Indian food!!!  Fantastic service and great ambiance!!!!  We enjoyed every dish we were served!!  Highly recommend chicken ruby!!!  Naan bread was to die for!!!  Definitely give this place a try!  You will love it!,1
5,"Mmm, this place truly deserves all the hype that it gets! Hands down the best restaurant I went to in London.
Two friends and I ordered the garlic naan, roti, chicken tikka masala, black house dal, chicken ruby, lamb and vegetable samosas, a bowl of greens, and a few sides of basmati rice. I also got the Bombay colada - one of the most unique and tasty drinks I've ever had. A little spicy and super refreshing with a good kick. All the food was absolutely delicious and the service was impeccable; our waitress was chatty and funny and recommended several of the above dishes to us.
Moving on to the main dishes - so impressed! Out of all the entrees, I would recommend the dal the most - very meaty and flavorful. The chicken dishes were incredibly tangy and spicy (ask them to tone down the spice if you're not into that). The garlic naan was warm and buttery and absolutely delicious! As was the roti - it absorbed the flavor of the previous dishes well and came with three very tasty sauces. Great samosas (I liked the vegetable more than the lamb) and uniquely crunchy / salty / flavorful greens. Overall everything was very very good and prices were reasonable, especially for London. It's a fun place to eat with a lot of people since dishes are pretty small - grab some friends and try out a bunch of things! 
Oh, and make a reservation in advance - it gets super busy. Breakfast and lunch hours are less crowded so that may be a better option!",1
3,"It was a good experience.  We've been curious to try this place, but every time we check it out, there's a long line outside the door.  Oddly, it wasn't that busy around noon on a weekday.  By the time we left though, there was that long line outside again.  The service was pretty good.  The food was not bad.  Maybe, I overhyped myself about this place.  It sure is popular in Covent Garden, but I would eat here again if someone else paid :) Otherwise, I wouldn't crave it.",-1
2,"When we searched ""Best Indian food in London"" on Yelp, Dishoom seemed like a no-brainer since it boasted over 1000 five star reviews. After learning the wait time for a table was over an hour and a half, we thought ""If people are willing to wait over an hour and a half for a meal, this food must be outta this world! No one would be stupid enough to waste almost 2 hours of their life standing in line for mediocre food!""
We debated whether we should stay or go, but the curiosity of why anyone would wait so long for a meal got the better of us and we decided to wait it out. There were several hostesses who put your name on the waitlist and bring you hot chai while you stand in the cold London streets. Exactly 1h30m later we were ushered inside. The restaurant was simply decorated, elegant, classy, but simple. I was surprised at what a well oiled machine it all seemed. I must have counted at least 5 hosts/hostesses (at least)! Over 20 servers, and hundreds of guests. We were guided downstairs where the ambiance wasn't as pretty, and after 1h30m of waiting we were seated by the staircase (where guests came in and out of), not the best start. My expectations are now really high given that I agreed to wait so long. We ordered a spicy shrimp dish with tamarind sauce, the paneer tika masala, naan, and the jackfruit biryani. The spicy shrimp dish, though a tad bit over salted, tasted delicious, and the sweet tangyness of the tamarind chutney made it a really flavorful dish. Unfortunately all the other dishes we ordered were underwhelming. The paneer tika lacked spices, it was flavorless, and other than the fact that we were eating cheese --- cause who doesn't love cheese, it wasn't very special at all, and it was even a little dry. The naan was neither bad nor good. It was just your every day naan that you can get anywhere (without having to wait over 2hrs for it). But worst of all was the Biryani. It was overpriced dry and flavorless rice, with very scarce pieces of equally flavorless jackfruit. The service was also all over the place. Although the host staff was friendly, our waitress was flustered and barely came to our table, we had to ask for water several times before it was brought to us. Lastly they boast to offer ""unlimited chai"" but when you're paying almost $5 per chai, it BETTER be unlimited refills. 
Under normal circumstances (meaning, if I hadn't had to wait in line for 1h30m, and then another 30m to get our food), I would given Dishoom 3 stars. Had the food been exceptional, I would have had NO hesitation rating it 5 stars, however, due to the mediocrity of it all, add the extensive waiting period, i would argue that 2 stars is a fair rating. As we were seated at our table, we heard many Americans chatting at several tables nearby and we realized Dishoom is more of a hyped up tourist trap than a legit establishment for fine Indian fare. I encourage folks to read The Guardian review of Dishoom (by Jay Rayner) before waiting 2hrs for an overpriced Indian meal. If you want to stand in line, then go ahead! But we'll be opting for a place in Southall with better food and no wait!",-1
5,"See my tip - for lines. 
Amazing food. Came for dinner and enjoyed an array of amazing food.  I wasn't a huge Indian food lover, but that's because we get a different version in the Western world.  I'd recommend asking your helpful server for suggestions - many sections have highlighted dishes and we ordered all of them to try.  The cocktails were fresh and yummy as well with a nice wine selection by the glass.  However , we did order the naan garlic bread, followed by the cheese naan ‼Save room for dessert - the chocolate custard was divine.  
Part II- breakfast was a no wait / walk in at 10am!  We had the bacon naan and chai tea which was amazing!!",1
5,"Really tasty Indian food with top notch service. 
Came here on a weekday evening and line was out the door with a wait time quote of 1 hr. I don't know if we were lucky or they usually over estimate their wait time but our wait was only about half an hour. Their dishes had so much flavor but my favorite was probably the chicken ruby, bowl of greens, and the lamb chop. I could probably do without the gun powder potatoes though. Thought I'd get really flavorful potatoes but it was just baked potato with a dipping sauce that didn't do much for it. I have to say their service was top notch! Our server Laura (I believe) was such a sweet heart who really took the time to explain the dishes and provide us with information and recommendations. She made us feel welcome and that's more than I can for a lot of our experience here in London.",1
5,"Worth waiting in queue! I like the fact this restaurant does small plates. All the dishes were delicious and loved the general busy ambiance of the restaurant. We ordered the popular dishes: okra fries, chicken ruby, spicy lamb chops and garlic naan. Perfect amount of food for 2 ppl. I think my favorite was the spicy lamp chops. Crusty, spiced, and so tender. Definitely a must for visitors and locals alike.",1
5,"This place 100% lives up to its expectations! As soon as I told friends I was going to London, every single person told me I must visit Dishoom. Luckily, I have a friend who lives in the area and she made a reservation for us as soon as she found out I was visiting! 
We ended up getting to the restaurant about half an hour before our reservation and just thought we'd check in to see if our table is ready. They directed us to the bar while they got our table ready. It was only about 10-15 minute later that we were seated at our table. Service was out of this world from the very moment we walked in! 
We ordered the chicken tikka, paneer tikka, black daal, pau bhaji, gunpowder potatoes, chilli cheese toast, jackfruit biryani, raita, garlic naan, and rumali roti. All for only 3 people - we just couldn't resist! Everything was so delicious - I don't think I could pick a favorite. I will say though that I'm not really a fan of daal, but their black daal was pretty delicious - even to me. Something that I wasn't really expecting to like, but loved was the jackfruit biryani. I've never had it before, or really any dish with jackfruit in it so I wasn't sure what to expect. It turned out to be what I probably ate the most of! I highly recommend trying it. 
TIP: MAKE A RESERVATION! I walked by the restaurant a few times during my trip and every single time there was a looooong line outside. I would have hated to be one of those people waiting in the cold. If you like Indian food and you're going to be in London, you're going to want to go here - just go ahead and make the reservation. :)",1
5,"Get here early if you don't want to wait long for a table! We got here at 545pm and there was already a line. While you're in line, they give complimentary tea. We were given a wait time of 40 minutes. What's amazing is that once a spot opens at the bar, they let you wait there and you have the chance to order appetizers and drinks while you wait for your table. Luckily, our wait time was way shorter than they said and we got seated in 20 minutes!
We had vada pav, calamari, and samosas as appetizers. For entrees we had two orders of the chicken curry, and order of daal, and the lamb biryani. Everything was absolutely delicious! My favorite dish was definitely the chicken curry. The curry itself reminds me of tikka masala because it's rich and creamy. The chicken was very tender. Great service, great food, and great atmosphere.",1
5,"Very flavorful meals.  Had the Dishroom Calamari for starters, Chicken Ruby, Spicy Lamb Chops, Gunpowder Potatoes, Garlic Naan and all DELICIOUS!!",1
4,The food was delicious but we had to wait 1.5 hrs to be seated on a Tuesday! The service was very good though. People are nice and friendly. Bartenders are very talented and professional. Would highly recommend... if you have time to spare that is. The wait time is Crazy.,1
5,"I've been here twice, once for breakfast, once in the evening.
Absolutely superb, one of my favourite places",1
4,"Last year, Dishoom was named as the best restaurant in Britain according to Yelp. Unsurprisingly, the wait at this Bombay-inspired café averages an hour. While it is quite long, they do offer hot tea (chai and mint) as you queue up. Grab a glass - it'll come in handy as the chilly evening sets in. It's also both free and delicious, so there really isn't any reason not to.
For being such a casual place with a reasonably priced menu, the ambiance here is quite upscale. To boot, the attentive waiters running around with smiles on their faces make for great service. They bang those dishes out blazing fast. I received my order within 10 minutes of placing it.
On the flip side, I think that the food here is a tad overhyped. While they do serve very solid Indian fare, I was not quite blown away as I hoped. Per my server's recommendation, I ordered the Chicken Ruby, the House Black Daal, and the Garlic Naan. All very good, none particularly outstanding. What actually wowed me the most was the mint & coriander sauce that was served on the side as a dip. That stuff was to-die for, so make sure you at least give it a taste!

5,"Wow this place is popular! Every time we walked by there was a line out the door! 
We came around 8/9pm on a weekday and it was about a hour wait. I liked that the wait seemed fair (followed the sequence in which people arrived) and they handed out hot tea while waiting. If you are waiting outside in line, they eventually move you to the bar where you may wait another 15-30 minutes. 
Luckily the food was worth the wait! We had their house dal and chicken ruby with rice and naan. This was one of my fiancés first Indian food experiences so I told him if he did not like the food here then he would probably not like Indian food anywhere. Thankfully we both loved it!
For dessert we had the chocolate pudding with vanilla chili ice cream. They were definitely the perfect complement to each other as I don't think I'd enjoy the chili flavor of the ice cream without the richness of the pudding.
I'd highly recommend coming here!",1
5,"Not an Indian food expert. 
We came here because we know London has amazing Indian food. My Indian friends told me it is much better than the food back home. From our yelp search, we made reservations here.
Two stories and we would recommend reservations given how popular it is. We decided to be brave and order a bunch of things we never tried. 
PAU BHAJI (A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered, home-made bun, Chowpatty Beach style. No food is more Bombay. (V)(S)4.50) - This was boxed on their menu and I wanted some veggies. This was our favorite item! It was so flavorful! Can't believe its veggies!
AWADHI LAMB (The lamb is prepared with stock and spices, then layered with rice and cooked in traditional 'dum' style. (S)10.50) - My husband loves BIRYANI so we ordered this. We ordered yogurt to go with it. They gave us a big bowl of it! The yogurt was really refreshing and delicious but unfortunately the biryani was so-so. Not as flavorful. 
HOUSE BLACK DAAL (A Dishoom signature dish -- dark, rich, deeply flavoured. It is cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony. (V)5.90) - Also boxed on their menu. It was our second favorite item. It is made from what I think is mung beans (or similar). You don't like mung beans then I wouldn't order this. 
DISHOOM CHICKEN TIKKA (A family recipe, using a marinade of sweet vinegar, not yoghurt. Laced with ginger juice, turmeric, garlic and green chilli. (S)7.90) - As close to the famous chicken tikka marsala you will get here. Came with 4 big pieces of chicken. Its not as creamy but good. It was a bit sweet for me. 
Garlic naan- we got one. You can get it buttered or not. It was good. 
Overall, it was a good meal. Unfortunately, I don't eat Indian food that often so I am no expert. Flavors were very different but good from the Indian food I've had in the States.
Plenty of restrooms that is pretty nice.",1
4,"Incredibly popular Indian restaurant in the heart of London, Dishoom impresses with its variety of choices and flavors, but failed to wow me.
Perhaps it was a little over-hyped and, to be fair, nothing was remotely bad but I didn't feel that Dishoom was particularly better than what I've had in the US, especially considering the price was somewhat expensive.
I will say that the Ruby Chicken was absolutely delicious, but the Garlic Naan was nothing special. The black house daahl basically tasted like a bean dip. The Chicken Tikka Roll was excellent and unique.
The service was nice here and while the recommendations were hit and miss, Dishoom is a solid choice in London.",1
4,"After many reviews and personal recommendations, we decided to venture out to Dishoom for Sunday dinner. The wait for two on a bank holiday, sunny weekend was average, but the queue kept moving. People have mentioned the lemonade that they serve in the queue: it's true, but it's salty.
After being seated, my husband and I ordered the greens, basmati rice, roomati roll, the minced lamb and the daal. Hands down the best was the black daal and the greens. I could have eaten a whole bowl of the greens myself! The sauces and spices with each dishes are very carefully balanced and flavorful-- nothing was overbearing from the other and everything on the table was complimentary to the other entrees. 
After a long day of leisure outside and exercise, I highly recommend ordered one entree and one bread/rice per person. We threw in the greens for color. 
Fantastic and we will be back!",1
5,"Great vintage ambience, great food which boasted of quality, tasty authentic food with a bit of a twist. You may have to wait a while but it's worth the wait. The portions are fairly small and it is expensive. We ended up ordering for the family of 6 and then ended up ordering again due to small portions. The Pav bhaji, vada Pav, paneer kathi roll and the daal were some of the favo",1
4,"I had a great experience at Dishoom.  I was visiting from the USA, where we have plenty of excellent Indian restaurants, but knowing how integral Indian cuisine is to the UK culinary world (chicken tikka masala is an unofficial dish of the UK!) I just had to try an Indian restaurant while I was here.  Dishoom came highly recommended by several UK Yelpers, so one night after work I made the trek to Covent Garden to check this place out.
Upon reaching Dishoom, I nearly turned away in dismay.  There was a huge line out the door, and I was told that it would be an hour wait.  This was at roughly 7 PM.  I decided to hop in the queue anyways, and I'm glad that I did, because it only took 25 minutes instead of the estimated hour.  While waiting in line, the restaurant offered its waiting patrons free cups of hot chai tea - much appreciated, especially on a cold London evening.
Once I finally got seated, I was pleasantly surprised by the ambience of Dishoom.  Hip, modern, and fancy... yet all the food items on their menu were very reasonably priced.  Upon my server's suggestion, I ordered a bowl of their signature Black House Daal, a bowl of their Chicken Ruby curry, and some Roomali Roti bread to mop up all the sauces.
The Black House Daal was excellent.  Very rich and hearty, with some nice texture and flavor from the lentils.  I'm sure there was an ungodly amount of butter in it, but it was oh so creamy and delicious.  The Chicken Ruby was quite tasty as well (the chicken was amazingly tender, the curry itself had a nice balance of sweet, spicy, and tomatoe-y) but I prefer my curry on the spicy side, so I wished it had packed a little more heat.  The Roomali Roti was a great choice - nice and fluffy and light, a perfect complement to wipe away all the curry and daal.
My server, Ali, was a total star.  Funny, welcoming, prompt, and professional.  He did a great job with all his recommendations and made my meal excellent.  Dishoom management - if you're reading this, give Ali a raise! (or at least a high-five).
So why only 4 stars?  The food was great, and I loved the Daal in particular, but I guess hearing all the hype for Dishoom, I had expected a little more.  Don't get me wrong - it was still an excellent meal, maybe just not worth the wait (even a shortened 25 minute one).
OVERALL: 4/5.  Great Indian food - very reasonable prices, especially given its location in Covent Garden.  Very long lines, so you really have to be craving Indian food to make it worthwhile, but I really enjoyed my experience here.",1
5,"Back to the original location for the first time in 5+ years. I wouldn't even try getting in for a pre-theater dinner, but thankfully they accept breakfast reservations and they held ours even though we arrived just after the 15-minute window. Breakfast at Dishoom is always a pleasure, but until this meal, I thought it ended abruptly at 11:45 a.m., the last seating time for the meal. Not so, at least here on this day: They kept bringing us chai long after that time and after we'd finished our meals and settled in to read the papers. We finally, reluctantly got up to visit the nearby Portrait Gallery and National Gallery.",1
5,"Cannot add much more than all the reviews ahead of me. Superb food. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Not a typical Indian restaurant per se'. In that you just dont order Tikka masala and call it a day. Its carefully flavored delicacies. Well priced, and quantity is good.
We had the Mango laasi, lamb chops, Dishoom Tikka chicken, rice, naan, samosas and the corn. Chai tea to finish it off. Everything was perfect. Worth the wait. Try it.",1
4,"Dishoom brings a freshness and uniqueness when it comes to Indian restaurants. The decor is thoughtful and intentional- it pulls through all of the fun and interesting things I saw growing up as an American Indian. All of the toiletries, movie references like the word Dishoom itself. It's a phrase like ""pow"" scene in superhero comics associated with a fighting scenes in Indian films. So it's fun, nostalgic and curious to be in the place. The food is also an elevated experience - the food options I'd say are classic choices - Phav Bhaji, Samosas, Matar paneer, etc. they taste really good though and have an extra pop. Drinks are great. I like their Bellini.",1
3,Not worth the hour and a half wait. The curries and naan are delicious but having to wait that long for food makes me not enjoy it as much. The day we waited was also pretty chilly. We got there quite early 6pm and still had to wait an hour and a half. Def come at an odd time like 4pm if you can go beat the crowd.,-1
4,"We had to wait a LONG time outside in a line to then wait another 15 minutes inside at the bar. This was our fault, we just stumbled upon this place and showed up without reservations - make reservations! When we got in the place is really cool, it has an old time hipster decor and we ate downstairs which was less busy than the upstairs area. However, we were right next to the people to our left and right, almost felt like they were eating with us! But the food was really good, just be prepared for smaller portions (we ordered naan, rice and the black Dal in addition to our plates) I don't eat spicy food that often, so I ordered the least spicy thing and it was still pretty hott - but delicious. The black dal was by far the best, we put it on everything, dipped our bread in it, and it took a bit of the spice away when your mouth got too hott (highly recommend getting this). Cool place, very authentic! Drinks are also very interesting (but pricey) - the bartender kicks butt",1
4,"First time eating at this place and at an Indian chain in general, so we didn't really know what to expect. Not bad, food was good but it was definitely overpriced. Our server was hard to find at some points. Four stars because of that and the prices.",1
5,"Found this place on Yelp while picking up some discount theatre tickets, and since we love Indian food and we heard the Indian food in London was amazing...this had to be tried. 
And oh boy was it delicious! We came in around 2:45pm local on a Friday, so it was a short wait...but after ordering the food (with some recommendations from the server), it was completely worth it. Specifically, the Chicken Ruby (their 'makhani' style dish) was off the chain, the House Black Daal was so so tasty, and the Lamb Boti Kabab was perfectly seasoned - extremely balanced and still juicy. Even the garlic naan was freshly glistening with butter!
The only slight disappointment was the Prawn Koliwada - I think we expected something slightly different, and while it wasn't bad once the main dishes came out, we completely ignored it and crushed everything. 
This place is so so good!",1
4,"Delicious food and has a nice selection of vegetarian dishes. 
If you have not booked a table ahead of time it can be difficult/ a long wait to be seated.
Great place for small groups.
Also the brunch is delicious! Would definitely recommend.",1
5,Amazing food! Everything is so good and tasty! The waiter helped us out with the menu without us asking. But it is very popular so get there early!,1
5,"It's very popular and always full. The staffs are well trained, nice, professional and thoughtful.
Definitely come back again. 
You'll be very happy after having a meal here. Worth every penny.",1
5,"Dishoom has spoiled Indian food for me for the rest of my life.  In a good way.  I don't even like Indian food, but I knew I had to try Indian being in London, and this place did not disappoint.
Great location in Covent Garden just down the street from Leicester Square tube station.  Kid/baby friendly (though they make you store your folding strollers/pushchairs at the front).  No wait without a reservation for a weekday lunch, but at dinnertime I saw queues outside starting at 5:30.  They had free chai for those in line to temper the wait though!
Everything we had was absolutely delicious:
* Rose Lassi with cardamom - so mild, fragrant, creamy and just lovely.
* House Black Daal - their specialty!  the lentil dip is rich and flavourful
* Lamb Boti Kabab - we had this with the black daal and raita; you can't go wrong with lamb in my books
* Jackfruit Biryani - my favourite dish, the jackfruit added a bit of sweetness and was quite light
* Raita - creamy and cooling mint/yogurt/cucumber sauce that went well with the lamb and jackfruit dishes
* Chicken Ruby - tender chicken an a bit of a spicy kick
* Garlic naan - nice and both chewy and crispy
Prices were definitely reasonable.  Service was knowledgeable and quick.  Downside is that I will never be able to eat Indian food ever again because I now have impossibly high standards!",1
5,We loved this place. As good as Indian gets outside of India.,1
5,"Best Indian food I've ever had! Ruby chicken and black daal were excellent, as was the garlic nan. So glad I checked Yelp for recommendations. This restaurant is super popular for good reason. Best to get a reservation or eat early, like we did",1
4,"Gotta be honest..I'm not a fan of Indian food. Never was. While planning a trip to London...I was INFORMED multiple times that the Indian food in London was THE BEST. That I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO TRY IT. Ok..I reluctantly agreed to give it a try. 
Dishoom, according to our radar, was one of THE top Indian food restaurants. So...Dishoom it was! When we arrived, there was a mini line but it moved fairly fast (10-15 mins tops). We were offered some chai tea while we waited...interesting taste indeed. We were quickly moved into the basement where the bar was...not much seating but packed and cozy. 
Onto our food. We decided to yolo it and order pretty much one from each section. Great decisions made that night ;)!!
GARLIC NAAN 2.20 -soft and fluffy naan bread with garlic flavors floating out while you eat. GET IT!
STEAMED BASMATI RICE 2.20-typical rice..I got it mixed up with the yellow rice...but this does pair well with the curry dishes.
OKRA FRIES 3.70 -deep fried and a tad oily.
PAU BHAJI 3.90-super soft warm buns meant to be dipped in this veggie paste?...it was mouthwateringly tasty.
GUNPOWDER POTATOES 5.90-chunks of potatoes mixed with spices and a hint of lime juice. It was a lifesaver when we got hungry in the middle of the night and decided to eat the leftovers. 
CHICKEN RUBY 8.2-not your typical curry flavor. I can't remember the exact taste but it was very flavorful.
All the food we ate was delicious and the price point was perfect. I would def go again. Must try in London!",1
5,"After waiting outside in the drizzling rain for close to an hour and grumbling about how the food BETTER be worth it, our party of 4 was seated on the upper level. The restaurant was absolutely packed but our waiter still took time to recommend and explain items on the menu. 
We ended up ordering a lot of food because we were ravenous after our wait. I don't know if it was because we had watched people eating through the windows while in line for so long or if the food was actually that good, but holy moly everything we ordered was delicious, flavorful, and made us forget our complaints about the wait! I'm sure you could close your eyes and point to any random dish on the menu, and it would be delicious. We ordered lamb biryani, chicken ruby, gunpowder potatoes, black daal, and garlic naan. It was almost too much to fit on our small table! The black daal really stood out to me. It was creamy, savory, and unlike anything I had tasted before. I think I fell in love with the black daal that day.
I finally understand why Dishoom is so popular and successful. I would gladly wait two hours in line just to eat here again! The hype is very valid and you won't regret it.",1
4,"Just had drinks on a Thursday night. They have an amazing range of drinks, although not the cheapest. Particularly recommend the old fashioned and the hoppy paanch.",1
5,"Wow....  When in Rome.....  or rather when in London you have to try Indian food.  Simply outstanding.  I sat outside so won't comment much on ambiance or decor although it looked great from what I could gather....  but the food was insane.
I had the gunpowder potatoes which were perfectly prepared, and covered in scallions.  Deep flavor, well cooked...  just perfect.
Chicken ruby is a must try... amazing flavor and rich sauce but the chicken is expertly cooked.  Moist and flavorful. 
Lamb kabob was also amazing and was another star of the show...  
I finished off with the cheese naan and together all this made a perfect concert..
Amazing place and if you like Indian food you simply must come here and brave the wait.",1
4,"We arrived at Dishoom at a sort of peculiar time. It was a little past 11:30 am on a Sunday. We had less than 15 minutes to order from the breakfast/brunch menu, but were not allowed to order from the lunch menu for nearly 30 minutes. Reminded me a bit of my childhood, going to McDonald's and driving up to the drive-thru window and finding out that you were either too early for the lunch menu or just missed the breakfast items by 3 minutes.
We opted to share a popular breakfast item, the bacon naan roll with the house chai, and stick around to be one of the first to order from the lunch menu. By the time we received and consumed the bacon naan roll it was indeed time for lunch.
Having already a base of food in our stomachs we didn't over order, which seemed like it could have been easy to do considering the extensive menu and the desire to want to try everything. We ended up going with some Dishoom staples, the black house daal (lentil curry), the chicken ruby curry, and some garlic naan and roomali roti to soak up some of the curry goodness.
We enjoyed both curries and the accompanying chutneys with our roti and naan. And, in the end, we felt like we came at a good time - we were able to try a delicious popular brunch item and beat the lunch queue that grew quite quickly at 12:00pm.",1
5,"So, in advance of going to London, I was told to go to Dishoom as it was the best Indian restaurant. Since I was hearing this from another Indian person who is family, I felt I had to go if it was possible. Considering this location is right near Trafalgar Square, it was quite perfect to stop by in our travels.
I was told in advance that the restaurant doesn't take reservations. Apparently it does. We arrived and were told there was a 40-minute wait. So, we put our name on the list, said screw it, and just walked around the general area. When we returned 30 minutes later, our name had already been called and they moved on. It was an annoying start. So we had to wait another 40 minutes that was actually 30 on their patio before being entered into Dishoom.
We waited for a little while longer in their bar area before being seated. 
The vibe in Dishoom is pretty cool. It's packed and we were seated with other guests at long family-style tables. 
Okay, let me get to the point: the food is some of the best Indian food I've ever had at a restaurant. The house black daal is unbelievable. They claim it is ""cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony"" and you can taste the preparation. The harmony is delightful. For that alone, and at 6 pounds, it is worth going. The other items I got were the okra fries and the paneer tikka, both were delightful as well and I'm sure the meat options are good too for those interested.
You could easily break your wallet if your eyes get too big for your stomach as everything looks and is delicious. However, for 2 people, we simply ordered these 3 items and garlic naan and it sufficed in the late afternoon after a long day of walking. To me, it was certainly manageable pricing for quite good food and ambiance in London.
I still will rate Dishoom 5 stars but there were two downfalls. I would say the reservation and seating situation was just a little unclear and odd given the popularity of the restaurant. I also think the service was a bit odd at times. I mean it's odd for me as an Indian person to have a white guy tell me about Indian dishes, but hey, that's just me and I know that's his job. But, more so, our server just kind of disappeared at one point without telling us and another server seemed to have no choice but to start serving us and handle our bill when she realized that guy was just gone. 
But, the reservations/service situation aside, Dishoom was that good that it didn't matter. You should definitely check it out if in London and especially because I'd expect as a tourist you'd be visiting this busy area of the city at some point anyway.",1
5,"I'm so glad I went to Dishoom. The ambience, food, service everything about this place is wonderful. Be ready for long lines. I waited an hour and half to be seated but while you wait they give you yummy indian tea (chai) and mint tea. Once we got inside I was so impressed with the ambience it's completely different from what you would expect from an indian restaurant. I ordered the famous house lentils, naan, lamb boti, chicken ruby, and rose/cardamom lassi. Everything was good. When I go again I don't think I'll get the lamb boti. I thought it was okay. But everything else was spot on. If you love lassi you have to try the rose and cardamom lassi, you won't be disappointed.",1
5,"Excellent! Everything: food, service, and ambiance. All of the reviews were spot on, can't really add anything additional except: don't pass this up! Line moves quick!!!",1
5,"Wow. I love Indian food, but I just ruined it for myself. The only thing better than the food was the incredible service. I waited in line for an hour, which flew by as the staff brought me lemonade and continued to update me on my status. I finished my wait in the bar, where I had an amazing Viceroy Old Fashioned. I over-ordered intentionally so I could try a few things and take home leftovers. By far, my fave was the Chicken Ruby. I also loved the House Black Daal and mopped it all up with a delicious garlic naan. I must come back to try more. Worth the wait!",1
5,"Given the long line to get in, (even in the rain!) it is hard not to have really high expectations.  Suffice it to say they were exceeded.  The food was spectacular and the service amazing.  I don't need to recommend anything, just ask your server, as we did our wonderful Kay, and you are in for a true treat.",1
4,"I had heard so much about this place since I booked my tickets to London. Mostly all my friends recommended me to visit this place. I made reservations online, couldn't get any dinner reservations, but got one for lunch on a Monday. Once we got there, we were promptly seated. The service is just amazing, they charge 20% as service fee though. The food was good, not great. Living in San Jose, I think I have been spoilt and have many better food options available around. We tried the chili cheese toast, local beer, ruby chicken, rumali roti (which wasnt that great). Overall the food was pretty good, ambience, menu, service, drinks all pretty nice. Its more of an experience to go there and enjoy a meal. If you are looking for really good food, may be there are other indian places in London which serve better food as this was catered to the english taste.",1
5,"The atmosphere is great, cocktails are lovely, staff is super efficient and friendly and they have a vegan menu option now. Love Dishoom!!",1
4,"I have to say--I didn't think the 45-minute wait on a Monday night would be worth it, but happily, I was wrong.  The service once you get inside Dishoom is top-notch and the Indian food is above average (had the black daal, the Chicken Ruby, the Roomali Roti and a cheese naan), but I'm not sure it was necessarily the greatest Indian I've ever had...maybe, in part, because I've been to India twice and loved the food on those trips.
But then?  I had the lamb samosas for dessert.  Sweet Jesus, these were amazing.  The samosas canopy shells were fantastic, the minced lamb inside was tasty, and the three spices left on my table were all excellent.
If I could make reservations here and know my seating time, I would have eaten here a couple more times to try other items on the menu.  As it was, very strong, but you can tell there are some very specific treasures on this menu!",1
5,"Oh my. I'm so happy I was introduced to Dishoom on my visit to London. There was definitely a pretty long wait (a bit over an hour) but I think it was very worth it. 
When you arrive you put down your name and at least one person per table has to stay and wait in line. While waiting in line, you will be offered a hot chai or water (definitely take them up on the offer! Especially if it is cold out!). Once you get to the front of the line, you'll be handed a buzzer and taken to the bar where you can order drinks while waiting for your table. Before you know it, your buzzer will go off and you'll be taken to your table to begin your amazing dinner. 
We ordered the chicken ruby, black dhal, spicy lamb chops, paneer, lamb biryani, naan (x3), and a bowl of greens. Everything was so delicious and my table of 4 finished off just about everything. I definitely wish some of the items on our table were a bit spicier (I LOVE my spice and was craving some heat) but overall, everything was great and I'll definitely be back to try some more items on the menu. However, I'll definitely be back for the biryani and the black dhal!",1
4,"The wait at this place was ONE HOUR!! They do give you small drinks while you wait (lemonade, sherry, chai), which is nice. The staff gets to you very quickly, which is nice. Ordered the Behl, which was strangely addicting. The Dahl was also very good. Spicy Lamb was good, but my chop was over cooked. Chicken Tikka roll was very amazing, but it's a wrap, not a roll. Chicken curry was also delicious. Roti was good, but I was craving naan a little more. Chicken tikka looked good, but as far as I could tell it was just grilled chicken (did not try). They don't ask if you want a dessert menu, which was nice and odd at the same time. I'm not used to restaurants doing that. The bathroom has an unnecessary amount of stairs (you walk up 2 stairs to get in and 1/2 the br is another 2 steps down... make it flat!!!). Overall good food, tho wait might not be worth it.",1
5,Came for breakfast . Bacon and egg  naan. Yum.  And surprisingly good americano I had with it.  Super crowded so go early.,1
5,"I am not an Indian food fan but this place has me converted.  Chicken, Mahi, Garlic Naan, Veg Samosa with signature black bean dip were all delicious.  We arrived at 5:30 on a Fri evening at Picadilly branch and was told wait was up to 40 min.  We were seated at our table in 30, food was delivered quickly and we were done with check paid one hour after getting in line.",1
5,"This is the absolute best Indian food we have ever had! So flavorful and original! If you're wanting something like tikka Marsala or butter chicken, order the red curry. It's pretty much the same exact thing. The servers are friendly and helpful too! I only wish we had a Dishoom back in the States!",1
4,"A few friends who recently visited London had great things to say about Dishoom. Mainly, it being a local, swanky, fun, loud,  delicious time. So immediately after landing and putting the luggage away, this place came to mind for dinner. Awesome introduction to London. Technically, Dishoom is ""Indian food,"" but it's also a a neo-fusion of culture and taste.
 Auspiciously, everything on the menu is a good choice. The host may attempt to recommend you get three entrées a person--my girlfriend and I ordered plenty after getting two or three entrées (altogether, not each) with rice and naan.
The food was so good!! Had we gotten another entrée or two, I definitely would've eaten it I would have fallen into a food coma immediately after.
The music in the background is great, some sort of blend between 1920 jazz, and swanky dance music. 
The wait is generally 30 minutes to an hour, but you can generally find a spot at the bar to grab a drink while you wait. If you're starving there's also generally two or three snacks at the bar you can purchase. For example, my girlfriend and I ordered vegetable samosas. Soooo good! Crispy light crunchy on the outside, nice veggie-mush on the inside.
Definitely not cheap, but not annoyingly expensive. I think the price is just right. Well, there are a few outliers that are more expensive. But the median price ranged from £9-15£. 
So, more than I would normally pay at a pub, but also a very nice dinner. Would definitely go again if I were to visit London. 
You can wear whatever you want to dinner, but I would generally go with smart-casual-- A reasonably nice shirt and a reasonably nice pair of jeans at least. 
The staff was wonderful. We got pushed out the door a little quickly but it was in a very polite way given we were literally the last customer of the night (we arrived about an hour before closing). So instead of, for example, being offered a dessert menu after the meal, we were brought the dessert menu and asked if we would like to close out now or after dessert. Or as we looked over the main entrée menu, the host would comment we only had about 10 minutes to choose ab order before for the kitchen would be interrupted from it's closing process. That was annoying. I kind of understood... but at the same time, we did arrive an hour before closing, not five minutes before closing. And empathy aside, we did spend a combined £40-£50 (including drinks). So as polite and eloquent as the host was,  the pressure (at the very least) did not add to the experience.",1
5,"Hand's down my favorite Indian place. High quality, fair prices, it's authentic and a treat every time.",1
5,"This was recommended to us by friends for a recent trip to London.  We arrived here on our first night in London, jet lagged and hungry.  There was a short line, but we were greeted and given a warming cup of mint tea for our wait.  It went quickly and we were seated downstairs.  Craft cocktails and a great ambience, lively and fun!  We had a delicious meal and would definitely come back!  We almost went twice during our trip, it was that good!",1
5,"I tried to go for Dishoom for dinner one night at about 8pm.  Forget it.  Liine out the door and waiting list was 1 hr.  Did I mention this was a Tuesday night.   Needless to say I did not give up, and came back on Thursday for a late lunch.    It was definitely worth it.  I had the fried okra which were very flavorful, a little to much spice for me but very nice.   I then tried the bbq prawns which were delightful, cooked on the tandoor, with the right level of spice and flavor, worth trying.   Then I went to the roomali roti with the house special chicken ruby.  This dish was fantastic.   A slight twist on butter chicken it had wonderful taste and was excellent.   This is definitely a place to go to when in trafalgar square.  The service is super fast, though the staff are clearly not experts in Indian food.",1
5,"LOVE this restaurant. Visited while on holiday in London. Ordered the tikka masala and garlic naan. I went with a mild spice after I was repeatedly asked if hot would be too spicy. I would recommend going hot with the spice in the curry. 
It's a bit of wait even during the week. I believe I waited for 40 minutes but it was near the dinner rush. Would recommend avoiding the lunch and dinner rush.",1
5,"Get here earlier than the dinner rush or you'll be waiting a while. Some of the best Indian food I've had and great service. 
Food:
-PRAWN KOLIWADA: A bowl of delicate, crispy morsels with tamarind and date chutney. 6.50
-CHICKEN RUBY: A good and proper curry with spice and flavour. Tender chicken in a rich silky curry sauce, best mopped up with a Roomali Roti. 10.50
-PANEER TIKKA: Paneer is vegetarian first-class fare and a subtle cheese to make. Marinated then gently charred with red and green bell peppers. Not worth trying again, because there are so many other delicious things on the menu. 8.20
-HOUSE BLACK DAAL: Dishoom signature dish -- it is like a dark, rich, deeply flavoured lentil textured dish in a rich subtle sauce. You can tell It is cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony. 6.20
-JACKFRUIT BIRYANI
Delicious, savoury jackfruit and delicately saffron'd rice, potted and cooked with mint, coriander and sultanas. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. So much flavor and was expertly executes. 9.5
-GARLIC NAAN
With minced garlic and coriander sprinkle. It is one naan cut in half. Get more than one serving per person, you won't regret it. Dip into anything, including their delicious chutneys. 3.20",1
4,"Perfect place for a small group of friends from out of town!
The wait: An hour and a half on a Friday night. First is the line out of the door. They kindly served us chai milk tea. Then, they led us to the bar where we waited another 30 minutes to get our table.
Food: I was very lucky to go with an Indian food expert where she made all the orders for us. Very delicious! I love their vegetarian options as well!
Service: Quite slow, but I understand because it's a Friday night so they were very busy. Our waiter kept disappearing when we needed him. Other waiters were helpful when we needed help.
Tip: Free wifi!",1
5,"I want to be proposed to at this restaurant. Yes. That's how happy Dishoom makes me. Wow! Wow. Wowww. This was the best restaurant I've ever been to. The food was delicious!!!!!!!!!!!! There was a two hour line but it was worth every minute. If you find yourself craving Indian food in London, I highly suggest trying this place out. It's worth it! Trust me. It's worth it!!! I hated Indian food and I'm very picky about strong smells, but this restaurant was amazing. It smelled divine. Wow. Wow. WOW. I am officially obsessed with this restaurant. Wow. WOW. Wow.
Get the Okra fries! Get the Garlic Naan and the regular naan. Get the Dishoom Chicken Tikka! You should also get the Black Daal & Ruby Chicken Curry. Honestly, just order the entire menu. If I was in London right now, I would.",1
5,WORTH EVERY MINUTE OF WAITING! The crispy calamari and the savory chicken is delicious . The interior is very beautiful and modern classic .,1
5,"Went to Dishoom for dinner and breakfast, both were amazing!
Dinner - black daal, ruby chicken, Bhel, Pau Baji (my fave). Flavorful and spicy!
Breakfast - Akuri and Fruit and Yogurt, Fresh grapefruit juice. 
Great service, delicious food - must try if you're in London. Beware of the long waits on the weekends.",1
5,"I had the Chicken Ruby and it was absolutely amazing.  The portion looked small at first but they packed a lot of Chicken in the bowl.  The Chicken Ruby tastes pretty much like Chicken Tikka Masala but a bit spicier (not be much).  The lines are long here, so be sure to arrive before the lunch/dinner rush.",1
5,"I fell in love with this place. The staff was courteous and attentive, which made the experience more enjoyable. We had so many dishes (as we visited this place twice while in London), so I'll provide some highlights. 
Good: 
Chicken Ruby was tender and flavorful. Reminds me of chicken tikka masala. Probably my favorite dish. 
Pau Bhaji was amazing! If you don't like to share food then I'd order 2 of these dishes then proceed to eat them both. 
House black Daal is a must. Eat it up with their garlic naan at your own risk because you won't want to stop eating. They may have to roll you out the front door after you pay. 
Bad: Nothing",1
5,"This was by far the best food I have had in London. I really was about to give up on finding something that I would sincerely crave once I got back to the states!  I don't remember the names of the dishes we ordered, but there will be a picture and the servers are super nice so they will know. 
The chicken tikka was so moist and flavorful. It went really well with the green and orange sauce!  
The bean curry packed a lot of flavors but wasnt too overwhelming. I feel like I could eat it with naan or rice every day. The garlic naan was crispy and fragrant. Loved how well it was cooked. The other breadlike item was actually just like a tortilla so it wasnt too impressive.",1
5,"It is worth the wait and the wait was faster than what they said it was. The food and drinks are fantastic and so is the service. We let the waitress recommend everything and she did not disappoint. We got the biryani, prawns, lamb, the daal. She thought the biryani might be too spicy for us and got us yogurt. The flavors were on point and this was probably the most empathetic wait staff that I've encountered. We also got the spicy ice cream and she recommended that we get it with the chocolate cake since it is too spicy on its own. She was right and the two really complemented each other. I would highly recommend eating here.",1
5,"Returned to Dishoom after an excellent experience several years ago. I decided to forgo the dinner wait and go for lunch on my first afternoon in London. Quality of the food is still impressive and the drink I had at the bar while I waited for my table also didn't disappoint. Will probably make this a regular stop whenever I visit London, if only so I can try other items off the menu.",1
5,"I guess I now know why people say London has the best Indian food in the world.   I do agree.  Dishoom definitely showed me the incredible taste of London cuisine.  
I am beyond amazed and would highly recommend!!! 
Note:  I came in a bit early, so there wasn't a wait, but the line started to pile up during lunch time.  Definitely worth it!!!",1
1,Totally overhyped. It was not worth the hour wait outside the restaurant. It was not very flavorful and was not traditional. You would think for a country that once claimed India as a colony they would at least be able to represent the food better. The place I go to in the states in much cheaper and much more flavorful than this place. Don't waste your time in line.,-1
5,"This is a very stylish indian restaurant.  All of the dishes we beautifully spicey in that the spice flavors were pronounced and distinctive, but they they all worked in perfect harmony.  I don't know where they get their spices from, but they are beautiful. The service was outstanding.  If I lived in London, I would be here every week.",1
5,"Great way to top off my visit to London. Don't let the line scare you off, you won't find a better meal anywhere. The staff is friendly and will serve you little glasses of sherry while you wait in line. Menu is quite large so get organized when placing your order. Dishes came out fast, fresh and hot. The lively atmosphere is great for groups. Loved it.",1
5,"The flavors were incredible! We loved this hip place. Very modern and delicious Indian food. Also, every meal you get pays for a meal for a child or family in India. Loved how conscious this restaurant was. Go to dishoom!",1
5,"AMAZING!!!!! worth the wait. Their service is spotless. We were told we were going to wait 90 minutes, no reservations taken, and although we were hungry and cold, we waited. Their staff brought out chai tea for everyone in line which was very kind. We asked if we could wait at the bar and after about 30 minutes we were taken there and the drinks were delicious. We must have been there 20 minutes and were then called to our table. We ordered a few tapas style plates having been told we should order two each to share but it was too much food. You may want to start with one each or a few and then continue. The food is like no other Indian food I've had in Los Angeles, both home cooked and at a restaurant. It is so flavorful, rich and unique. Definitely worth a visit.",1
5,"This was a great meal. Service was outstanding. My favorite dishes were the greens bowl, the chicken tikka, and the daal bowl.",1
5,"What can I say about Dishoom that hasn't already been said?........Not much. So I'll keep it short.
Prawn Koliwada - Yum! Has a really nice kick
Chicken Ruby - Get it. Shhhhhh. Don't ask questions. Just get it.
Prawn Moilee - Mild compared to most Indian dishes but delicious!
Garlic Naan - Obvious must
Dishoom Slaw - Refreshing and a great palate cleanser
Okra Fries - Spicy & crunchy
To be honest I think I blacked out a little because I was too excited. Everything was A1. 
Please open a location in NYC.",1
5,"All the previous reviews pretty much covered it. Amazing food, well organized in terms of wait times and collecting you for your table. Serving sizes were good and creative drink selections. Best Indian feast we have had in a loooonnnngggg time.",1
5,Great overall experience.  Sat outside.  Great variety of options for vegetarians.  All four us were stuffed.  Service was very attentive.  Covent gardens is place to be.,1
5,"Dishoom is simply fantastic!!! Great atmosphere, the best service and the tastiest food ...no matter what you order! The popularity of this place has grown over the years and most times you have to queue to get in, but it's simply worth it! Can't recommend this place enough ...you will not be disappointed!",1
5,"I've always loved Indian food and I've been to many good ones, but dishoom has to be the absolute best I've ever had. Everything was so flavorful and amazingly delicious. Our favorites had to be the calamari (we ordered two), pau bhaji, and chicken ruby. The chili cheese toast was also very good and I recommend ordering the jackfruit biryani. The wait was a little more than an hour for us on a Saturday night at 7pm but absolutely worth it since they give you free chai tea in line!",1
4,"In Carnaby, off Oxford st.
Can't go wrong eating at Dishoom.
Hot spot for locals and tourists alike.
We went on a Tuesday around 6pm, waiting an hour or so for a table, had a drink in their bar while waiting.
Cool decor. 
The veggie samosas were delicious.
Cheese paneer sooo good. 
Garlic and cheese Naan, tasty!
Would def return.",1
4,"When in London, you got to have some Indian! If you don't have a reservation, the waiting queue is out the door. I didn't have a reservation and was told the wait time was 1 hour and half in which my boyfriend and I waited as we had nothing better to do that day. While on line, they would serve you some hot chai milk tea to wait as we were there during the winter. The line actually moves pretty quick and in less than an hour, it was our turn. Once we enter the restaurant, there is another short wait down by the open bar but the wait there was also pretty short and we were then taken to our table. 
The curries were amazing! Although, I kind of wish I didn't order the mango dessert as it was just a Popsicle stick. I thought it would be something authentic that I can't get anywhere else, but it was still good nonetheless.",1
5,This place is worth the hype & the atmosphere/attention to detail is amazing.   Food is very good & so are the cocktails.,1
4,Wonderful food. Upscale and not like traditional curry joints in London. Not an extensive menu but quality ingredients. A little pricey but normal for central London,1
4,"Overall good experience. Wait time is always 30-45 min. But they make sure if you get a lemonade or chai while waiting. As soon as you get in, you dont get a table, you get a space at a bar. Then they call you for a table. They take your drinks to table and make you comfortable. Food was perfect. Had lamb samosa - tasty and lamb chops - very tasty. Mango lassi was ok. House chai is must have at the end of a meal. Choices are limited so make sure you check a menu online first and then come. If looking for something fancy indian dish, you will be disappointed. 
Drinks are of variety. Need to come again to try-'em all. I would come here again.",1
5,"Not only was this the best Indian restaurant I had in London, it was probably the best restaurant I went to in London!! Everything was great from service, to decoration, and yes the food...can't wait to go back!!",1
5,"I was craving Indian food in London and decided to go to Dishoom. It was long 45 min wait at 7pm but they were super nice and offered us hot Indian chai and sherry as we waited outside in the line. 
Once inside, we really liked the vibrant and clean ambience with lingering indian spices from across tables. We ordered Keema Pau, Vada Pau, Bhel and Pav Bhaji for starters. Loved envy dish since it was cooked to perfection without any excess oil. Went in big group with Europeans and Americans and everyone could eat it without compromising on their spice-level threshold. 
For the main course we ordered Chicken Ruby, Chicken biryani, Black daal, Roomali roti and Garlic naan. The biryani and dal were spot on. Wasn't too impressed with the ruby as it lacked the flavour and was bit bland. We wrapped out meal with kulfi and chai - hard to go wrong on these!
Service was great, waiters were friendly and we got complimentary far far. It was a reasonably priced restaurant and didn't burn a hole with all the food that we ordered. 
Overall, great food and service. Felt at home in this cosy restaurant and will definitely visit again!",1
5,"Creative, cultural dishes that make me want to return until I can try everything on the menu. I am both impressed and appreciative. They sat a group of 6 on a busy lunch without a wait. We ordered lots of food, chai tea, and starters that, even with 6 people, had split/individual checks. Would recommend to all friends visiting London.",1
5,"I'd always heard that London had some of the world's best Indian cuisine, while Dishoom is listed by many as the go-to for anyone visiting the country. I can certainly see why, as the food was amazing. I wish I had gone in with a bigger appetite, because I would've loved to have tried 3 or 4 more menu items. I still get a bit emotional when thinking of how good the naan was. If you ever find yourself in London and looking for stellar Indian cuisine, I can't recommend Dishoom enough.",1
5,"We went to Dishoom the first day in London around 4:30pm and were told it would be a 1 hour wait. We decided to come back another day. Last day before leaving London we came back around 2:30 figuring it was between lunch and dinner so the wait wouldn't be too long. We were wrong; 1 hour again, but this time we decided to wait. So glad we did. The food was fantastic. We had the Pau Bahji, the house Black Daal, the Roomali Roti, Prawn Moilee, and the Mahi Tikka. They were all so good. Also had the East India Gimlet which was a very refreshing cocktail. The service was very good. As I said, well worth the wait.",1
4,"Thankfully we made a reservation a week ahead, therefore we had no problems getting into the restaurant. The queue outside is big so better make sure to make a reservation!
The food and the location are great. The only negative thing about it is that we paid a service charge (12%) and were given the bill right after we finished our desserts. We planned to have a few more drinks but no one seemed to care. Nevertheless it was good food and a nice experience. I suggest the nimbu pani a refreshing drink for everyone.",1
5,"Absolutely incredible Indian food - likely some of the best my wife and I have ever had. Compared to other Indian restaurants, the food is more tomato-based (which to me is a huge plus). Everything was plenty flavorful and actually spicy when it says so!
We over-ordered and attempted to stuff ourselves...
The hour and a half wait was a bit silly, but we both agreed that we'd do it again!",1
4,"Amazing food and service flavours were perfect, however due to popularity waiting times were long, almost an hour to get a table, serving sizes also weren't huge, I ordered two mains just because I couldn't decide and I'm glad I did because I finished both plus dessert. Otherwise everything else was great",1
5,"The food is amazing!!!! My girlfriend and I wanted some Indian food while experiencing London and found this spot on Yelp! Boy am I glad we came. The food was amazing and the service was great. We split 4 dishes, garlic naan and some rice. Our favorite was the the spicy Lamb chops. Can be a bit pricey, but well worth it.",1
5,Absolutely incredible! The food here was amazing and the service was good. I would highly recommend to everyone.,1
5,"Outstanding.
Dishoom's the best Indian food I've had in the world, hands down. Some may say it's better than what they've had in India (I would agree, but I've only been to Sri Lanka).
It's tough to get a table, so definitely book in advance. The staff is as friendly and helpful with choosing dishes, so do take advantage of that.
Literally every dish was incredible and fresh - it really opened my eyes to what Indian food can taste like with great ingredients. I got the chicken masala, various naan, and some starters. 
It's pricey, yes, but you get what you pay for! Definitely worth the effort if you want to plan a great meal London - won't disappoint.",1
5,"This restaurant is amazing!! I was traveling in London for 2 days only and was told it's a must try, and I'm glad I stopped in! I had the chicken ruby which was delicious, and the chicken so tender. The naan was buttery and fluffy, mango lassi was light and refreshing, and samosas crispy and flavorful. Get there on the early side because it fills up quickly and they don't take reservations; I got to the restaurant at 6pm and was seated at 7pm, but well worth the wait!",1
5,"Dinner at Dishoom was amazing. We waited for probably 30 minutes for a party of 2 late on a Saturday night, but they had originally guessed it to be 90 minutes...so we were pleasantly surprised. The chicken ruby, garlic naan, cheddar naan, lamb chops, house black daal, and a side of white rice was 44 pounds total (and more than enough food). All SO delicious!",1
5,A fantastic and different place for breakfast and brunch. Everything we ordered was delicious and cooked perfectly. Service attentive but not overly so (which is nice). The place filled up quickly after opening so reserve a table or get there for doors open.,1
5,"Its worth the wait. The staff is great, very pleasant while you wait in que and so is the wait staff. Food is awesome! I came back twice in the week we were here and was not disappointed.  This is a must when in London!",1
4,"Breakfast is fire. Bacon naan was insane. Sauces were also bangin. They need to work on the kati roll though, it was pretty weak.",1
4,"4.5 stars.
Walked up to the restaurant's queue around 6:25pm, ended up seated within 45 minutes (pretty good considering I was prepared to wait up to an hour and 20 min as the hostess had suggested). While you wait in line, another hostess will offer samples of the House Chai to ease up your hunger.
I dined solo and was seated at a small table instead of the bar so I was able to relax a little more. The staff were wonderfully attentive, great service and my waiter made sure to keep an eye out for me whenever I needed something. Based on the Yelp reviews, I ordered the vegetable samosas, chicken ruby, and garlic naan, and everything was delicious! The chicken ruby was spicier than I expected (I tend to eat mild to low-medium spicy, this was a little further along the medium range imo), and in hindsight I should've ordered some rice to offset it a little. I also requested still water, but I guess this meant bottled water and so I was charged another £3 for this (oops...next time I'll be sure to say ""tap"").
All in all, it's a pricier establishment but you won't be disappointed with the food at all. I may have to come back here to try other dishes before I leave London.",1
5,I can't help myself.. I just keep coming back and consistently the dishes are fabulous. As a vegetarian there are some great options.. Don't eat before dinner and come hungry!!! Order the Chai--best around.,1
4,"Delicious Indian food in Covent Garden! 
There are great Indian options in London, but this restaurant really serves up a modern flair to some traditional classics
// SERVICE // courteous and prompt
// WAIT // 10 minutes at 9 PM On the weekend
// FOOD //
     + roti: chewy with a good bite, similar to naan 
     + Chicken tikka: tart and delicious, chicken was soft. 
     + Chicken ruby: never have had this before but the chicken was very tender and the roti was perfect for dipping!",1
5,"All the good reviews and we needed to try this place. If you use Yelp to search for good Indian food in London by ratings, the top five Indian restaurants that show up are Dishoom. While it's a small chain - the food is definitely is not chain like. They told us that the wait will be an hour and 15min. We almost decided to leave but we were only in London for a days and a half so we waited it out in the bar. If you have to wait get the Dal Moth - this little snack is so very tasty. 
The atmosphere is very lively, and the staff super friendly. They even have a small kids meal menu. 
Turns out the wait was only 40min but even at 1hr and 15min it would still be worth the wait. The best dish we had was the Black Dal - it's their signature dish. It's cooked for 24hours and it's basically Dal with a light smoky taste. Very yummy :)
In all we had some samosas, four different curries and the chicken berry biryani - got a side or rice and some rita. That was plenty for a party of four. 
If you have to have great Indian food, I would highly recommend Dishoom as a place to go. Pick the one on Kingly Street just a short 15min walk from Piccadilly Square. The neighborhood for this restaurant is very fun.",1
5,"Well worth the two queues and the 70 min wait. One of the best Indian meals I've had in a while. Also excellent cocktails and exceptional service for London. Our server was the best we've ever had in London and was much more ""American style"" as far as her attentiveness.",1
4,Food and service were both excellent.  We went on a Tuesday night with three people.  Waited for 30 minutes at 5:20.   It was worth the wait!,1
5,"I love this place.The  best Indian food in London. If you are going to
London I recommend you heading over. Just be aware of time because it tends a to get really crowded really fast.",1
1,"Oh my. I thought Indian food sucked in the US, but eating here made me realize that the food back home isn't that bad. Ordered a chicken curry and a daal dish. Both seem to have similar flavors. Ordered rumali roti which was basically a regular roti just a bit skinnier and bigger but should not be called rumali. Anyways, if you want flavor and spice don't come here. If you want color and the feeling that you are eating borderline Indian food, sure ...",-1
5,Try the chicken ruby! The best Indian curry I have ever tried. I swipe every single drop of the sauce in the bowl with garlic naan that night. And other food is not at that level with dat RUBY.,1
4,After waiting in line for an hour we finally got in. Fusion Indian ambience. The menu offers mostly Indian street food with some exceptions. The food was good not great. Slightly overhyped in my opinion. Decent overall.,1
4,"There's a long wait even with a booking to dine here but hey, its kinda worth it.  Really it's the upscale Indian place you want. Is there a better butter chicken elsewhere? Yes.  Is the paneer just as good and cheaper elsewhere? Likely.  Can you take it all and put it under one roof?  Well that's what Dishoom does.  The great quality across the board for a higher dollar price.  It's the way to go, no doubt.",1
5,"1. Service- very attentive and friendly. Both times I came here, I had two different servers, and they were both very professional. They were very welcoming and they made sure you had everything you needed. It's A-La-Carte, so wait to be seated, order and pay at the table. 
2. Price- this place is affordable, and not expensive at all. For two people, you'll pay about £30, but that depends on how much you order though. 
3. Ambiance- modern and hip. There are two stories to this particular restaurant. I guess you can say there is a Ground level and a Lower Ground Level. Or perhaps as we better understand in the states, 1st floor and a basement. Haha. Dress code is casual. 
4. Food- we had cheese naan, Gunpowder potatoes, Chicken Ruby, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and Vegetable Biryani. My favorite were the potatoes, and the Tikka. Everything was very flavorful and I have to say, it's the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to.
5. Cleanliness- superb. I can't complain.",1
5,"Wow! This place is fantastic!! 
Ask them if u can mix the garlic and cheese naan. Sooo amazing. Chicken ruby was perfectly seasoned and delicious. I'm not big on Indian food but I will be going back here ASAP!
I got there when there was no line but as soon as I left, there was a line of 25-30 people, so you may want to call in advance. 
This place is a must if you are in London!",1
4,"We came on a Sunday evening after 6 and there was a wait for 45 mins for seating 2 people. This location I felt was quite huge as compared to the other two. Dishoom is located in the heart of the carnaby street and has some delicious dishes to offer. 
The reason why I give this place a 4 star is that the wait is much longer anytime and any day of the week and there are very limited vegetarian options to try from. This is a street side food joint without a twist straight from Bombay as they put it! The food is good delicious but I still feel this place is a bit overrated. There are only 4-5 veggie small plate dishes to choose from but all are very flavorful. Still wish they had more vegetarian options to choose from. 
Coming back again if I crave for some street side Indian food.",1
5,"I heard from several friends who recommended this place, and now I know why! Dishoom was absolutely delicious, and even though I don't really eat Indian food, I love the food here! 
Food: 5/5! Actually all of the dishes were delicious, not a single one fell short. We had the okra fries and calamari, and both were fried perfectly, but very oily. Okra fries were almost like yam fries! The chicken tikka was good, but not spectacular. The lamb kebabs were better I think, but personally not a huge fan of lamb. The lamb biryani was one of my faves! The rice is amazingly blended with different flavours, and we added Raita to it too (felt almost like chicken over rice. We also ordered a bowl of greens which was actually very good and helped balance out the heavy meat dishes. I highly recommend the garlic naan and the matter paneer, those were the other highlights of the night. Drinks wise I really liked the mango lassi, and it was a perfect balance for all the spicy and oily dishes. 
If you're in London this is definitely a must try!",1
5,"Dishoom, please come to NYC -- I love you! 
This restaurant is a must for my husband and I when we're in town and with good reason. The food is extremely flavorful and the service is fab. The last time I visited this location with my parents, the bartender downstairs took care to provide them with descriptions of each and every cocktail and what made it special. 
I recently tried it for breakfast and immediately made next-day reservations at another location just so that I could try a different dish.",1
5,"I really do think Dishoom has spoiled me for Indian food! The only time available for a Thursday night reservation for 4 was at 5:30- that's still considered to some a HH, but the place was already packed.
Started with Vegetable samosas, garlic naan, and pau bahji all AMAZING as well as the condiment sauces with the samosas. Chicken tikka, prawn moilee, and house black daal were all cooked to perfection.
Alin was our server who took the time to explain the dishes and encouraged us to share- he was very knowledgeable on all the dishes and kindly asked if there were any dietary restrictions within our party.
No room for dessert but will definitely return again....and again! I had touched on reservations prior, make sure you book them. On our way out, there was a line of patrons half down the street- that should show you how great Dishoom really is!",1
5,Best indian i have ever had. If there is a line outside make the right choice like we did and wait.,1
5,"BEST INDIAN FOOD I EVER HAD!  Life changing. It was worth the wait even though I don't understand why they make it look like. A club line and you need to head to the bar first before being seated. Why can't you just wait for an open table if you don't want to go to the bar. Besides my disapproval of the seating process, the food was delicious. The black daal is supposed to be the house special but I thought it tasted like bean soup. However the chicken curry and the rice with lamb was amazing. The garlic naan was best naan I ever had and wished each serving was more than 2. Going to come back here before my trip ends.",1
5,I high recommended. Friendly people and good atmosphere. This is my second time i have been in this restaurant and always keeps a nice food and still in high demand...,1
3,"A contemporary take on Indian food. I felt like this place was over-hyped. The atmosphere is cool, but the food is average. You can definitely find better desi food elsewhere. 
The wait was a little long (for a Sunday evening) and they don't take reservations for groups smaller than 6. However, while you wait you can have some chai (it has more spices than usual), water, or lemon water. Which was a nice thing while you wait. 
We waited about an hour for a Sunday evening around 9:30. 
The menu had a lot of options, some traditional and some they have made their own versions of. From everything we ordered - the seekh kabobs were the best.",-1
5,"This is my first Indian meal in London and the quality of food, taste (of the naan and chicken ruby atleast that I had) was authentic and great to taste",1
5,Great Indian food. Great flavors and atmosphere. I would highly recommend this place. Show up early or expect a wait.,1
5,"Oh, Dishoom. You were wonderful. 
In dire need of Indian food on a cold London evening, we found Dishoom through raving reviews online and once we got there its popularity was clear: the wait was permanently an hour and 30 minutes- there was even a line to wait for the 1h30m line!  We wanted to understand the hype and ended up waiting about an hour (I think they try to throw people off with that long time) and all the while they serve hot spiced chai- delicious.
Once we were in, I asked what the waiter's favorite dish was, chicken ruby, and tried that. We paired it alongside their lamb biryani and a cucumber salad veggie dish. The food was DELICIOUS. Definitely try the chicken ruby! So so good, we even came back and tried the suggestion of another waiter, malak paneer (just.omg.incredible!), the chicken biryani and garlic naan. Everything was well worth the wait! 
Some small downsides: the cider I tried here definitely is an acquired taste. I love ciders, and if you do too maybe give it a go, but it seemed to be watered down and a little spiced? Not my favorite. Otherwise, the dishes themselves can be on the medium/small side, and the mains don't come with any rice, bread, or veggie sides. So if you're ordering chicken tikka, that doesn't come with a side of rice, or a piece of garlic naan, or a small veggie dish. I'd keep that in mind, as the price can stack up quickly when you add all of those combinations up.
Either way, Dishoom was delicious
  and worth the hype! The atmosphere was an interesting old school London/Indian 60s and 70s vibe? Great experience!",1
5,"Amazing! Loved the flavors. I was solo, so going back soon to try more dishes. Worth the wait.",1
5,"Taste better that what I was expected. I had the garlic nan, chicken ruby, calamari, fish something and shrimp something. I guess I am coming back for dinner tomorrow! Better than the best Indian restaurant in san Francisco and los angeles",1
5,"Dishoom was our first stop in London for dinner and well worth the wait. With 700+ reviews already here, I'll give you a rundown of what stood out to me most. 
1) The line outside snaked around and around, but they sweetened the experience with hot chai tea and sherry. Once you get inside, you *may* think your wait is over but instead, you're transported downstairs to the bar area. We had enough time to get a drink and apps there. Our total wait time was about an hour but these little extras made it fly by. 
2) We ordered okra fries and lamb samosas at the bar, then Dishoom's signature dish (and vegetarian) house black daal, curry-infused chicken ruby, and garlic naan at our table. There's nothing I would not recommend. 
3) I love how Indian restaurants offer an array of non-alcoholic drinks that are delicious like laasis, and Dishoom takes that one step further with teas, coffees, and sodas. That being said, I still went with some cocktails including the super refreshing Bollybellini and classic Bombay Pimm's. 
4) I truly enjoyed reading the menu and learned that the restaurant donates a free lunch to schools in India for every meal you eat at Dishoom. 
5) I would've come back here time and time again (including for breakfast!) if I had more time in London. There are heaps of other dishes I need to try. 
So there ya have it. Believe the hype. Love the hype. Taste the hype.",1
5,"My wife and I found our equivalent of food nirvana here at Dishoom in Covent Garden.  
Admittedly it doesn't start well. When you arrive, if it's anywhere near a meal hour you'll find a line. However, I'm here to tell you that you must overcome any concern you have about the line, I don't care if it's raining sleet. Get in that line soldier and stick it out, the victory of incredibly delicious food will make the pain and suffering fade immediately. 
We had the following
Buttered Plain Naan
Black Lentils
Lamb Sheek Kabob
Paneer curry
Vegetarian samosas
 We loved everything. While my wife and I prefer yellow daal, this black daal was amazing. The naan was very fresh with excellent flavor and a touch of crispy.  I could have eaten 3 orders of the Lamb without the benefit of any sauces, but the sauces are so damn good I used them anyway. 
The vegetation samosas were clear and away the most flavorful and balanced (potato to other ingredients) we've ever eaten, a great crutch in the crust followed by incredible flavor. I really wish I'd had room left to get an order of the lamb samosas.
The paneer curry (that's right cheese pieces in curry) was terrific and would satisfy anyone regardless of whether they're vegetarian or not. 
The bar is where they send you to wait after you've made it in the door (3-7 mins) and they do a pretty good job there as well. 
We can't wait to head back to London so we can return to Dishoom.",1
5,Don't let the line (queue for the Londoners) discourage you. This restaurant is well worth the wait. My main dish was the chicken ruby with the Roomali Roti and holy mother of pearl. I wanted a bucket of this curry to go. The spices (and hot spicy level) were on point / next level flavors. I'd go back in a heartbeat and would recommend this place to anyone traveling to London.,1
5,"Hands down my favorite Indian food I've had thus far! Being from the Bay Area we have tons of good Indian restaurants but you guys are something else! The restaurant had this cool hip/fun vibe that you'd find in NYC, with very traditional flavors but with a modern twist. We ordered pretty much everything on the menu, our waitress probably thought we were crazy, as she tried to stop us & said this is plenty... Everything was delicious! Oh & those 3 little sauces they give you...ask for more as you will want more later! lol To top it off the service was great. Can't wait to come back again when I'm back in London. Wish you guys would open a location in SF!",1
5,"Amazing tasting food. Everything was delicious. It took awhile to get our bill. We got the lamb chops which were perfectly cooked, nice and tender. We also got the koliwada which was crunchy and had a beautiful blend of spices. We also received the cheese naan as well as the potato dish both we good. Lastly we got desert which was a perfect blend of chocolate sweet with a spicy scoop of ice cream. All in all excellent me definitely recommend.",1
4,"When we arrived at around 6:30 on a Friday night, there was a long line down the street, but it moved quickly and we were glad we waited! The food was excellent, and the atmosphere was great; admittedly, the service was fair to poor. Our food arrived quickly, but our server wasn't attentive about refilling drinks or bringing the bill. I would still go again and again.",1
5,Best meal we had the entire time we were in London. Highly recommend this place to ANYONE. I wasn't the biggest fan of curry going into this place but boy was I wrong! Every single thing we tried was delicious but our favorite by far was the calamari dipped in the green chutney they served. IF YOU GO TO LONDON EAT HERE. Make a reservation though. The line was quite long for those who hadn't made one.,1
5,"This was without a doubt the best Indian food I have ever had. There is a wait of about half an hour, but it is definitely worth it. The food was perfect, and reasonably priced considering it is downtown London. The waiter also brought out an extra dish at no charge, which was awesome! I would definitely recommend visiting this place if you are in London. It really made our trip awesome!",1
5,"I can't say anything everyone else hasn't said... GO CHECK IT OUT! The hype is absolutely worth it.
We were quoted at about 1.5 hours, but were seated in half the time. While we were waiting they gave us delicious hot masala chai. Plus the free wi-fi kept us occupied.
We were seated downstairs and the decor was awesome. Everything has such a great unique touch. 
For food, we had the chili cheese toast, gunpowder potatoes, ruby chicken, rice, naan, and roomali roti. It was the perfect amount of food for 2 people. The cheese toast and ruby chicken was phenomenal. Honestly some of the best indian food I've had in a while!
We also got a bottle of wine.. everything was pretty decently priced for being in the heart of london and a fancy indian restaurant!",1
4,"Even though we were hungry, cold, and wet after waiting 30 minutes outside to eat Dishoom, I was still impressed with their Indian food. At the bar we ordered the lamb samosas, which were absolutely amazing and tasted exactly like the ones grandmother makes. I loved how the skin was crispy, thin filo and the minced lamb inside was flavorful. 
Once we got a table, we ordered the House Black Daal, Pau Bhaji, Chicken Ruby, Prawn Moilee, and the garlic naan. Everything that came out was delicious but my favorite was the Prawn Moilee, which had perfectly cooked prawns and perfect broth for dipping naan. 
Dishoom was definitely worth the wait and one of my favorite meals in London.",1
5,"The food here is great. Waited in line for about 45 min in the cold weather, but it was worth the wait.",1
5,Amazing suggested by a local and the chicken ruby was exactly what we wanted!!! We added rice which accompanied the sauce perfectly. We went to another local place but they didn't have a curry dish so we asked around and heard about Dishoom. I already recommended it to a friend that is visiting London!!!!,1
5,"One of my favorite restaurants in London. Excellent modern Indian food. We ordered a few different curries, daal and naan. Particularly like the Ruby chicken (rich creamy curry with tender chicken - a good alternative to the common Chicken tikka masala we had in the US) and garlic naan - great flavorful combo. Lively trendy atmosphere. We came early (right when it opened) and avoided the long line.",1
5,"""You HAVE to eat Indian food while you're in London!"" is what I heard over and over again before our trip.  We only spent two days in London, but Dishoom was definitely my favorite meal while we were there.
We got in line around 10pm on a Saturday night and were told the wait would be over an hour.  Several people in line decided to jump ship upon hearing this....DON'T BE THOSE PEOPLE!  We waited for maybe 20 minutes before we were seated.  I asked my friend who lives in London about this and she's had the same experience multiple times as well.  Even if the wait were an hour, the food is worth it.
- Dishoom IPA: Yes, they have their own beer and it's good!
- Okra Fries: Highly recommend this as an app.  If you think you don't like okra, think again.  This is not that slimy fried okra we have in the states!  The fries are crispy and really well seasoned.
- Black House Daal: A signature dish for a good reason.  The flavors are incredible and we ended up ordering a second serving of garlic naan just to finish this off.
- Chicken Ruby: Husband ordered this because it was mentioned in almost every single review and he loved it.  I had a couple of bites as well and ended up convincing him that should just share our dishes. HA! 
- Mahi Tikka: This was my order and it was SO good.  The fish is cooked perfectly, leaving it juicy, flaky, and tender.
Our server was friendly and the food came out super fast.  My husband, who is normally not a huge fan of Indian food, could not stop raving about this place and has recommended it to several of his friends who were visiting London.  Now that says a lot!",1
5,Delicious Indian food with a really nice ambiance inside the restaurant. There is always a wait so either be prepared to wait or try to make a reservation.  They also have a nice selection of beer and wine.,1
5,"I have been ruined for all other Indian food. This is a must eat type of place. Ask your waiter to help with offering- ours made some great suggestions and we loved it all.  
We sat downstairs and I thought it was going to be a bit loud and crowded. Once I started eating that all slipped away and we were just focused on enjoying it all.
I had an East Indian Gimlet with my meal - perfectly balanced the heat of the food. Had a chai tea - perfectly spiced and smooth - and a hot toddy with dessert - chocolate pudding with chili ice cream. It was all delicious.",1
5,"Delicious food, courteous service, prime location. Dishoom is everything I expected from an Indian restaurant in Covent garden. Highely recommended.",1
5,"Best Indian restaurant I've ever had! We waited an hour and a half in line for a table but it was worth it! Wonderful service-- our server talked us through everything on the menu and gave great recommendations. My fiancé and I got the pau bhaji to start, then the chicken biryani, lamb boti kebab, garlic naan, black daal, and the creamy cucumber sauce. All delicious and they went so well together. Would highly recommend this place!!",1
5,"Amazing food. I was about to throw the towel in about legendary Indian food in London but good thing we stopped by. Had the Ruby chicken, paneer tikka, roti, garlic Nan, gunpowder potatoes and chole bhathura. Everything was pretty amazing. I personally like chewy bread and the nan was pretty chrispy but still good. I preferred the roti. Paneer tikka and chicken was amazing. The portions are absolutely perfect and my wife and I were completely stuffed and couldn't finish our meal. 
For dessert we tried the Kulfi and it was creamy and still good. We'll probably come back tomorrow. This is hands down the best Indian restaurant in London. I wasn't a huge fan of the other three we tried here",1
5,"+++
perfect Indian food
(I thought I've eaten Indian food, apparentlyI never had until I've been here)
++
- Chicken makhni was superb with the perfect hint of spice
- Black daal of a perfect complement to the makhni
- Ive never had mango lassi like this one
- Prawns were awesome and perfectly grilled; a little on the spicier side
+
- Lamb samosa was perfect G
- Garlic naan was crispy, delicious, not too filling
- Unlimited Chai tea
- The colada with the rum!
+/-
- If you're into trying something new, try the Indian spiced cider...with ice
lunch hours is less busy (we walked right in around 3, by the time we left at 4:30, the line was building)",1
5,"This place is as good as it gets. I've come for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and everything on the menu is flavorful and cooked perfectly. The wait staff are kind and helpful and this place is good for groups or small parties. 10/10 recommend!",1
5,"Had so many helpings of the garlic naan here. You know naan is perfect when you can eat it on its own.
Please order the chai! I haven't had chai this good outside of India, ever.",1
5,"The atmosphere was great, the service was beyond accommodating. We had a big party and they were able to fit us in quickly and went out of their way to take care of us. The food was delicious! I recommend the lamb biryani, and everyone I was with was more than pleased with their food. Service + Food = A++++++++",1
5,"I'm really beginning to appreciate Indian cuisine. 
So many travelers rave about how spectacular Indian food is in London, compared to traditional ""bland"" (so they say) English food.
I knew I had some research to do, because I only look for the best. With that said, Dishoom was the spot that was recommended the most.
So, I get there after struggling trying to find the place. There's an intimidating line outside the door, the guy tells me it will be an hour wait. It actually took about 45 min. Good thing about the wait in line, is that they serve you delicious Chai tea.
Any way, I get in and order the highly recommended, ""Ruby Chicken"" (their version of Tikka Marsala), Chicken Biryani, and a Naan with melted cheddar insided (if you're from Mexico or the U.S., no need to get this, it was good, but it's practically a quesadilla...been there, done that).
Every thing was so tasty even down to the 3 sauces that accompany every meal (chutney, tamarind, and some green sauce).
The staff was very nice, and the ambiance of the restaurant was nice as well...I sat downstairs.
My advice...try it!",1
5,"Wow! What can I say about this incredible restaurant. From the moment you enter this vibrant, lively place you embark on an extravagant culinary journey. The food is not even close to the typical restaurant Indian food. It is in fact a fusion of Indian and British influence; a fusion of flavors. Wow! 
We are very fortunate that we have cooks at our homes in India and in the US, so we do not usually eat outside Indian food. When one of my wife's friends suggested Dishoom, we immediately said that we did not want to eat at a restaurant. There is something sort of sacrilegious about Indians eating outside Indian food. Please don't ask me to explain why.  That's just how it is. 
But Dishoom blew the doors off all of our conventional thinking. We did not expect to have such a great experience. Not only was the food delicious, but the staff was incredibly kind. Our waitress could not have been more hospitable. She explained all of the dishes as if we had never tried Indian food before in our lives. It was actually quite refreshing to hear someone describe our own native food in such an enthusiastic manner! All of the food she recommended was fabulous. I loved the Dishoom India Pale Ale beer. 
If you are in London, you MUST go to Dishoom!",1
5,"Byriani Byriani Byriani....the chicken one is the best I ever had!!!
Yes we waited an hour in line...in the cold and yes it was completely worth it. They also passed out hot chai and mint tea to those waiting in line. Chai was the best i had...
Got the naan (amazing buttery goodness)...and a lamb and chicken dish (forgot what they are called)..wish i got a sauce or curry based dish to pair along with it to sort of balance out our little feast but it was still divine. Portions are perfect not too big not too small(Ok maybe small for the states, if you are a fat American like myself get a couple of dishes). 
Couldn't decide between two desserts and I ended up picking one reluctantly..and our waitress brought us back both desserts and said the other one is on the house Sooo incredibly kind!!! They really treasure their customers. The desserts were soo good but I loved the chocolate one with the chili ice cream. My lord!!! I will definetely return to this gem on my next trip to London! I loved the vibe of the area too. A ton of young people!! And the inside at night is dark candlelit and relaxing.",1
4,"We went early but there was a short line, which was made pleasant with complementary mint tea or chai. We tried vada pau, mattar paneer and the prawn special, which was my favorite with a buttery cream sauce and cilantro. All great with rice or Naam bread.",1
5,"My boyfriend and I dropped by for dinner before heading to catch an opera in early November, and we got there just in time. The line quickly grew moments after we arrived. Although we had to wait outside in the cold, servers brought out small glasses of chai hot chocolate. I had never been to an Indian restaurant nor tried Indian cuisine, and that was such a perfect introduction to what lied ahead. Once seated, the waitress informed us of how dishes were served family style there and went through various menu options and recommendations, which were incredibly helpful to me. I remember us ordering the chicken ruby, roti, house black daal, gunpowder potatoes, and a rice. We both found everything to be incredibly delectable! He had Indian cuisine before and stated that this was, by far, the best he has had. I fell in love. We regularly think back on this restaurant and wish there were one in Houston! We will definitely be stopping at a Dishoom if we're ever in London again.",1
5,"Not overly spicy food, perfectly flavored and just delicious! From the naan to the tandoori chicken, the grilled shrimp and 
black dahl were some of my favorites.",1
5,"OH MY GOSH! This is my favorite restaurant of all time! If you are in London, you have to go here. The food was spectacular. Definitely worth the wait in the queue. We got the lentils that were so amazing. I am still dreaming about them... ask the waiter for recommendations! They know what is best to get.",1
5,"Worth the wait in the freezing cold , the serve Bombay style cutting chai while you wait. Lamb chops and fried okras were excellent. Amazing match for my craving for Indian food. Friendly Staff.",1
5,"Best indian food I had in London! Best to order a couple of dishes to share (the ruby chicken is amazing), but be prepared to wait for at least 20 minutes!  I went with my uni friend who recommended this and absolutely worth it.",1
5,"When we were planning our trip to London, I knew Indian food had to be something we ate while we were there. I looked at many places until I found Dishoom. The reviews looked promising so we chose the Covent Garden location based on preference of where we wanted to be. 
When we arrived we saw a long line. It was almost like the lines you see to get into a bar/nightclub. I had been warned about the lines from other reviews but was surprised by what we saw. We were immediately greeted by a staff member who took our names down and apologized for the wait. He said it was going to be an hour and half. Yes an hour and a half. But we were determined and everyone else in line seemed to be in good spirits so we got comfortable and waited. They do take reservations for parties of 6 or more. The staff offered us some chai tea and green tea to sip on while we waited. The line moved and when we made it to the front, we were greeted with another staff member who led us to the bar. From there we ordered drinks and then a staff member came and took our drinks to our table. We were taken care of by 4 people even before we sat down. The restaurant's vibe is 
Our server came and made recommendations. By that point, we had already decided on what we wanted because we had plenty of time to look at it. We ordered Chicken Tikka, Chicken Biryani, rice, regular naan and garlic naan, and raita (yogurt sauce). The food was so delicious. The food comes out family style which is typical in Indian culture. Everything was well made, flavorful, and a good amount of spice. The service was fantastic too. Like I said, from the moment we got in line until we left, we were well taken care off. Definitely worth it.",1
5,"Great food. We had several people recommend this one & it lived up to the hype! Every we ordered was awesome: chicken curry, naan bread, coleslaw, & pau bhaji.",1
5,"I was blown away by their food. Everything was delicious (Chole Bhatura, Murgh Malai, Jackfruit Biriy) but my favorite thing was the House Black Daal. 
Besides that, the service was great. I would suggest making a reservation if you don't want to wait in line for an hour but, if you do decide to wait they serve you complimentary hot/cold drinks. They also allow you to sit at the bar for small snacks and drinks while you wait for a table. 
Overall, a great experience, no complaints, and I wish I lived closer to London!",1
5,"One word: wow! 
The service and the food were so amazing.
The line was a little long, it took us about 40 minutes to get seated. However, they offered us drinks in line (chai, etc) which was super great and convenient and complimentary.
We ordered some drinks and samosas which came out so timely. The samosas were delicious and the chutneys were just the perfect kick. We ordered the dishoom chicken tikka, and honestly if you love chicken that's the dish to get. There is no curry with it so I would recommend a naan with it. But it was the perfect amount of spices tied with the perfect texture. Finally, we finished off with some kulfi (mango and malai) and it wasn't too sweet, but just the right amount.
I recommend anyone who is in the area to try this place, you won't regret it!",1
5,"Best Indian food I've ever had, I wish they had restaurants in the states. I had the vegetable samosas,  prawn kaliwada, roti, and house black Dahl.",1
1,"Would give 0 stars! Very poor customer service. The two women up front who are ""helping"" to seat are very discriminative! They let people in according to their whims and fancies. Would not recommend this restaurant.",-1
3,"Good food all around. Authentic indian ambience and food was very good. 
Some small niggles, the water glasses were smelly and the chopped onion we asked for were stale.",-1
5,"Absolutely incredible Indian food.  I can't spell most of the stuff I ordered but it was all amazing.  I didn't think much of the cider when I first ordered it, but it actually pairs with the food incredibly well.",1
5,"SO. F**KING. GOOD!
We were visiting London for a week from Boston, and had already heard about the place. When we wanted to have dinner on a weekend night, the wait was 1 hr and 40 minutes, so we decided to come back during lunch on a weekday. The food was simply heavenly, and the price was very affordable. Fast and great service. Seriously, what's not to love about this place?!!",1
4,"We went there on a Monday night and the wait was much shorter than expected. The starters were delicious, flavorful and quite unique. The main dishes were not as exeptional, but still very good. The place has a modern and trendy vibe and the service was impeccable.  We will definitely be coming back.",1
5,Fantastic Indian with a great ambiance and solid cocktails. The wait is long but they have a great bar to grab drinks while you wait.,1
5,"Dishoom is the most incredible Indian food I have ever had in my life. We waited about two hours for the meal but it was 200% worth it. I would recommend this place to anyone living in or visiting London. The ruby chicken, vegetable biriani, side of greens, Dahl, shrimp, and chickpeas are all so great. The okra fries are the best I have had. The food is so flavorful and for the amount of food you get it is very reasonably priced. Amazing food- can't edit to go back",1
5,"Amazing service! The warm chai as we waited outside was delicious. As soon as we neared the front of the line, we were taken downstairs to the bar and ordered drinks there. Soon after, we were seated and the food came out quickly. AWESOME service and delicious food! A must go to place for those on vacation!",1
5,"I eat indian food regularly (in California) and it's really good, but this was excellent! There was so much flavor, even if it was mild spice, it was all so tasty. I also loved the ambiance and the cocktails. I visited this restaurant with some friends who were all in town the same night. I flew out the next day, but my partner who stayed for business went back twice that week. I am eager to revisit London just to come back here. ;)",1
5,"The food was delicious and the staff was friendly. It's surprising that England is a huge fan of Indian food, but hey its a thing. Enjoyed this place a lot and would eat here again.",1
4,"We were told Dishoom was the best Indian food in London, and Indian food is pretty rampant in these parts.  It was pretty tasty (after a few days of eating sub par food, since during the holidays most things are closed).  While most of the dishes had good flavor, there were some misses.  
Grab a few dishes of curry, naan, tikka. The biryani is a good staple.  Some of the food has good heat to it, so don't forget to pair it with some raita to cool it down.
All in all, this is a great place for groups.  A good time and pretty good curry.",1
5,"This place is just as good as all the reviews say it is. I'm from Manhattan and have been to many Indian places over the years. Our server was Alin who gave outstanding suggestions. We had the lamb samosas to start, large Kingfisher beer, and we split the lamb chops, House Daal, plain naan, and Tikka wraps. Finished it up with the coffee Martini. I have a dairy allergy and they willingly adjusted the drink to fit. Overall outstanding. Would highly recommend to anyone trying to find amazing Indian food in London. Would absolutely make a reservation ahead of time Bc it fills up very quickly. Cheers!",1
5,"Some of the best Indian food I've had (and I've had a lot)--far and away the best of the five Indian restaurants we tried on our trip to London. Wonderful atmosphere in each of the seating areas. Good service, even though they were busy. The Black Daal was amazing, as was Ruby's chicken. Good naan, good appetizers. And one of the best gin and tonics I've had in a long time, too.",1
5,Perfection. That's no hyperbole. Sheer perfection. From the hospitality to the impeccably made food. I can't rave enough. Get the Paneer wrap and thank me later.,1
3,"Dishoom is solid, but certainly overhyped. Make sure you have a reservation, or be prepared for a very long wait. The interior was great, unique touches and fun elements from India, and the service was also excellent. The food itself was good, middle of the road. 
Overall, good, but over hyped. Great interior and service. Naan bacon roll was tasty but nothing too special, same for the paneer tikka. I'll be back to try a few more dishes, and the ambiance and concept are nice enough that this place warrants multiple visits.",-1
2,"Not worth the wait in line if you're craving the taste of real Indian food. Samosas had a tough plastic like skin. Chai was good but very sweet. The corn was like any other corn and extra salty. Potato was bland. Okra fries wasn't great. Overall I've had much better Indian and can get far better in nyc for the same and less money easily. 
You pay for the hype and ambiance here. That's it.",-1
4,I like this Oily bread which is much delicious and Energetic but Heavy breakfast more important that who make this type delicious breakfast.,1
5,"The wait was worth it and truly family friendly.
We enjoyed all the food and best of all the specialty of the house. Black daal and naan. Go early !",1
4,"Who knew London would have such authentic and excellent Indian food?! This was my first time in London. A friend picked this restaurant. I would give five stars if our wait wasn't so long (about an hr and a half on a Monday night), but we were able to sit on the patio and order drinks from the bar while we waited. The food was literally amazing!! We had garlic naan, jackfruit biryani, paneer masala and mixed green vegetables. The cocktails were great as well! I will definitely revisit the next time I return to London!",1
4,"Good food, friendly service, pleasant experience and a nice experience. But, not worth a long wait that many Yelpers reference can take place after 6PM.",1
5,"Lunch
Starter 
Squid in batter
Mains:

Food: except for squid starter everything else was delicious. 
Service: 4/5 Fast, on point. Be it by email or in person.

4,Good Indian food. Nice cocktails. True they always have a long waiting which kind of is putting of. I wish they would take table reservations,1
4,"Really fashionable Indian restaurant. The decor in any of their restaurants is just beautiful. Food is really good. Breakfast is yummy and different from the typical scene in London. For lunch it is better when you are more than 2 people so you can order different plates between all of you to try  all of them! 
Don't forget to book or you will have to queue for a bit.",1
5,"Our dinner experience at Dishhoom was excellent.  The food was incredible!  We got some advice on amounts to order from our waiter, and we had a perfect amount. The only thing we regret is that we didn't have time to come back for brunch.
We would absolutely recommend Dishoom to our friends, and would come again ourselves when in town.",1
2,"Cool design ,food below average much better Indian food available in london ,none of the dishes tasted fresh ,probably Pre cooked in bulk to cater
To the long lines,I really cannot understand what the fuss is all about extremly average food go for ambience only",-1
4,This place was absolutely delish! Tried the fried okra and it was out of this world! Waited in line for more than 30 mins but they give you a delish chai or green mint tea!,1
5,Just arrived in London and a friend recommended this to me. Drool so delish. Fast service. The wait staff is super friendly and would stop by to engage in convo. You could tell it was a great place to work. Good vibes and authentic family owned restaurant. They had a handicap restroom,1
4,"The hubby and I came here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. The restaurant was kind of busy even at almost  2pm. We were told that it will be about half an hour wait. We decided to do it, but we were actually seated in about 10 minutes. The waiter was very informative about all the dishes and offered us a non dairy menu since I'm slightly lactose intolerant (meaning I can have some dairy but not a ton of cream or yugert in the dish). We decided on the following dishes:
KEEMA PAU - spicy minced lamb 
Really flavorful and not too spicy.
DISHOOM CHICKEN TIKKA - grilled chicken with their family recipe no yugert. 
It was so good and flavorful. The chicken was slightly chared on the outside and juicy on the inside. 
MASALA PRAWNS - delightfully succulent and tasty.
Garlic naan - perfectly soft and slightly crispy
A bowl of green - fresh green veggies 
All the dishes were great and the 3 dipping sauces have distinct flavors and you must try all of them to see if you like sweet, spicy or minty spicy. 
I also had a Bombay colada (no rum), it was such a delicious drink I could have 3 more.
We really like this place. The only not so great  thing about it was the hostess kept telling everyone to go wait outside. It was a very windy day, luckily we found a spot to wait near the entrance to shelter us from the wind.
But this will not keep us from coming back.",1
4,"First off, the vibe is so amazing. I felt like i was eating at an outdoor Iranian cafe. It was relaxed and bohemian and fresh. I loved my dish (is was similar to chicken tikka masala). My hubby ordered a dish and was disappointed it wasn't saucy. We had an order or roti and garlic naan. It was delicious!",1
5,"Ruby chicken still is an amazing dish - chicken never tasted so flavorful!
Chicken tikka is done dry here and is a great twist on the national dish of UK.
Black house daal packs a lot of flavor for just some lentil beans.
Would come back in a heart beat",1
4,Great atmosphere and amazing cocktails (in addition to the fantastic food). Ask the bartenders for their house made shrubs and concoctions... The black dal makes me so happy. Great for vegetarians.,1
4,"Dishoom.. We need you in California. Since when did Indians make breakfast rolls with the naan? Have I been living in a cave or is this a UK thing?!? Cmon bruv!!
A warm flat naan with some amazing smoked bacon coated with a sweet sauce and a perfectly runny egg where the yolk bursts when you take a bite?! And the little bits of mint that compliment the savory sweetness perfectly?! Wow.. I could eat this for breakfast any day of the week. I thought this place was awesome but its just based on one breakfast item. They give you a little red sweet jelly type of sauce to dip it in. Sooooooo goood!! OH MY DAYS! Lol..",1
5,"As the queue outside would suggest, this is a great Indian restaurant in downtown London. Though dont pass it by because of the line, we were seated in around 10 minutes. We sat in the basement which has amazing ambience. Service was great, food was delicious (we had lamb samosas, dishoom chicken tikka, house black daal, matar paneer, with rice and naan. The daal would be the one dish Id say was just alright while the rest were great), and the cocktails were fantastic.",1
4,"Beautiful restaurant located not too far from Piccadilly Circus. The inside is supposed to be like a intimate cafe in Bombay, and it does not disappoint with the lovely decor and detailed furnishings.
THE WAIT
The queue is really confusing. Get in line outside the restaurant, but make sure you find the person with the iPad to add your name to the official queue. We didn't, and it resulted in a lot of confusion from the staff of what to do with us. There are heaters outside and wiki, so the wait isn't terrible. Plus, they bring around complimentary mint tea and chai (so good!).
FOOD
++ Lamb Samosas (4.90)- done really well with plenty of stuffing and a crispy exterior
+ Pau Bhaji (4.50)- reminds me of a sloppy joe. The meat stuffing is a tomato-based dish, and you stuff it into the little rolls.
++ Chicken Ruby (8.50)- one of the highlighted dishes here. Chicken cooked perfectly in a tomato-based sauce.
+ Garlic Naan (2.50)- really small, with only two small pieces. Less fluffy than I would like.
++ Prawn Moilee (16.50)- generous portion of giant prawns.
+ Basmati Rice (2.90)
+ Pineapple Pepper Crumble (5.50)- really interesting twist with the addition of the pepper, creating a nice sweet/savory balance.
DRINKS
++ Chocolate Chai (2.90)- chai + dark chocolate
++ Naughty Chocolate Chai (6.50)- chai + dark chocolate + bourbon",1
5,I loved Dishoom. The atmosphere is great and the food is amazing! You will not be disappointed.,1
5,"The best Indian restaurant in London, which arguably makes it the best Indian restaurant in the world.",1
4,"Very good Indian food, in a well run, high volume operation. They have good cocktails, too. We had a variety of dishes, and all we're great. The only exception was the corn, which tasted great,but which was way overcooked. Make reservations well in advance.",1
5,"Best Indian food I've ever had. You will stand in line but it is totally work the wait. We tried the prawns the Mahi, calamari, and chicken in a tomato sauce. All were fantastic. Great cocktails and atmosphere as well. Try to go early so you aren't stuck waiting for 2 hours.",1
5,"My companion and I? We don't like Indian food. Even so, we decided to give Dishoom a shot since literally everyone ever told us to come and give it a try, so we arrived later in the evening, falling asleep because we were so tired. And boy are we glad we came.
The menu is extensive - lots of somewhat smaller sharables for order. We got a veggie mash, potatoes, garlic naan, chicken, and quite a few other items for just the two of us, leaving quite a few leftovers for later on. Make no mistake however - leftovers were because we were completely stuffed, not because the food was bad.
I can't speak for authenticity, but the flavoring was delicious and unlike anything I had had before. Though distinctly Indian, the restaurant improved on the flavoring and had a great garlic naan that lasted in taste beyond its warmth. The okra was also exceptional, and the worst dish may have been the lamb or the potatoes, which really says something - they were good too. 
The environment is also worth talking about. Its a bit like a transportation back in time, an underground bar and a nice sense of decor tying the place together.
Come here, whether or not you like Indian food. You just may be pleasantly surprised.",1
3,"We went here for breakfast and it was not a pleasant experience.
Some food was good; the naan rolls were delicious. The restaurant has quality food suppliers.
Some were disastrous. The mushrooms were way overcooked. It became completely inedible and tasted like charcoal.
Mostly, the waiter completely forgot to bring my main dish. I waited for more than half an hour and cannot even find my waiter. I was starving to begin with and I was feeling a bit pissed after a sustained duration of starvation and the inedible mushroom.
After I explained the situation to the head of the wait staff, they brought my egg and bacon roll out finally. And the management apologized and offered this meal free on the house. So I appreciated that.",-1
5,"This was by far one of the best meals I have ever had!
Drinks and appetizers were fantastic, and just enough to munch on, but not too much that I was not hungry when I got my meal.
The chicken tikka, with aromatic rice and garlic naan had a great flavor without the garlic being too overpowering. 
We had a wonderful serve who answered all of our questions on the menu and gave us great sight seeing recommendations throughout the city. We were tempted to go back for the rest of our meals in London.
Would definitely recommend getting there early as it is incredibly busy, but a wonderful place to spend an evening.",1
3,"London is known for having the best Indian food after the country India itself. When I visited London, I was with an Indian food fanatic who insisted on eating it as often as possible. After hearing about Dishoom and the wonderful reputation it had, we knew we had to visit.
Since Dishoom is so popular, it's well known that you're going to encounter a long line when you arrive. We had read reviews of people waiting up to 2 hours. My sister and I came prepared for the long haul. We weren't going to leave, no matter what. Luckily for us, we waited outside for about 45min (thankfully since it was pretty cold outside). We thought we had finally made it in, but then we were directed to a bar on the bottom floor to wait longer at a bar. I'm guessing Dishoom does this to get you out of the cold, and get some drinks in your system while you wait. We were called to our table about 15 minutes later.
My first impression of Dishoom was how busy it was. The restaurant is loud and filled with voices of people having a good time. Every seat was taken and the restaurant worked like a machine getting people in, feed, and out again. I thought the large restaurant with so many people was overwhelming. While it was a bit off putting, I took it as a good sign that this place is so popular and liked by people, that it's very packed.
To start the meal, we got the vegetable samosas, and the keema pau. Both were the highlight of the meal for me. The vegetable samosas were tasty, and the keema pau was just as good. My main dish is where I think Dishoom failed. I got the Dishoom Chicken Teeka Roll and it was pretty bad. The roll was very dry, there was hardly any taste to it. I have to say, after hearing such great reviews about Dishoom, I was really disappointed. I'm not one to believe in the ""you got the wrong dish"" mentality. I think every dish should be good at a restaurant, not just a specific one. My sister got the mattar paneer and really liked it. 
I wanted to like Dishoom because of the great reviews, but it just wasn't as spectacular as people say. The service was great, the atmosphere was cool (but overwhelming), and my main dish was lackluster. Would I visit Dishoom again? Probably. I would see if I could pick a better dish and enjoy it more (even though this goes against my usual judgement).",-1
5,"Food:  From the top of my head, my wife and I ordered the naan, the chicken ruby, prawns, and samosas.  The chicken ruby was very good.  Most of the food we tried were pretty good.
Food rating:  5/5
Service:  We waiting almost an hour outside in the cold, but the nice thing was the free chai and (I forgot the alcoholic) they gave out to their freezing customers!  That was a nice touch to it.  Service here is pretty standard.
Service rating:  4/5
Price:  Expect to pay about $13 per small entree.  Portions are small but I believe they are meant to be shared.
Overall:  The was the best food I tried in London, only complaint is that the lines were way too long.  The price you pay for good food.",1
5,"This place is a must if you're in London.  My wife and I were in town for a long weekend a few months back and made sure to come here after reading all of the good reviews.  It was so good, we ended up going back again 2 days later.  This was hands down some of the best Indian food we've ever had.  The wait is always really long, but it's definitely worth it.  The staff also gives out free chai tea and sherry since the wait is usually 40+ minutes.  Everything here is delicious, and over the 2 nights that we ate here, we enjoyed the grilled masala prawns, garlic naan, chole bhatura, chicken tikka, butter-bhutta corn, gunpowder potatoes, okra fries, fried calamari, pineapple pepper crumble, and chocolate pudding with chili.  The drinks are good too and I recommend the Dishoom IPA and Viceroy.  Highly recommend this place if you're in London and are craving delicious Indian food.",1
5,I've eaten at Dishoom's four times in the last two months and I don't even live in London (I'm from San Francisco). It's my go to Indian food when I visit. Every dish I've ever ordered has been delicious. The fried okra is a particular favorite.,1
1,"After a stellar experience 2 years ago I decided to visit today. Unfortunately the quality and experience of the food has dramatically dropped. It's now just another average Indian restaurant. The door staff was extremely rude and condescending. Overall, won't be coming back here again.",-1
1,"Terrible place!  I never ever take time to write reviews, but this place was so bad it has brought me here to write my first ever bad review.
They literally ruined our dining experience over water.  My girlfriend mistakenly ordered distilled water when she didn't mean to.  I remember the waiter framed the question in a way to deliberately confuse with only two options.  In any case, I am less shy than my gf, so I spoke up for her and let them know that's not what we wanted.  So they brought us regular water instead.
Then a few minutes later the waiter walks over just to argue with us about the water. Completely unnecessary.  I calmly replied like an adult that it must have been a miscommunication then.  The guy just crapped all over our mood with his negative tone and arguing.  I was dumbfounded as he walked away from the table with his disrespectful tone with us.  We spent the whole dinner talking about what a terrible place this is.  We waited an hour in line in the rain for this terrible treatment.  
The food is not worth it.  You're paying for the ambiance and experience which was bad.  Either they have bad staff, or they are pressured by management to upsell the customers.
Summary: Don't go here!  Better options elsewhere!",-1
4,"Great meal in London as advertised.  Had the chicken tikka and lamb samosas and both were very good.  Note that portions are not that large, but neither are prices considering what they could charge given the line down the block.  I was seated before 5 though, and had no issues getting a table.  Definitely recommended.",1
4,"Review for Dishoom in Covent Garden!
This place is popular so just expect no matter what time you arrive, you will be waiting in line.  If you are lucky, only 10-15 minutes, but it can be as high as 60 minutes.
However, they probably manage to make a long wait not seem as long by compartmentalizing you and keeping you moving. If you are outside, every 10 minutes they bring around fresh hot chai to keep you warm.  Within about 25 minutes, they move you to a new waiting area by the bar.  You hang out there, have a drink, check out the menu, etc.  By the time you are at your table, you already know your order, probably a little tipsy from your well crafted pre-dinner cocktail and ready to chow down on delicious food.
With this menu and with the usual blandness of English food, you really cannot go wrong with anything.  However a few items are my go-tos:
Chicken Ruby: This is what most people confuse as Chicken Tikka Masala.  Deliciously done and properly with a hint of cashew to thicken the sauce. 
Chicken Tikka Roll: If you ever had a Kati Roll or Frankie, this is a classic preparation of the street food style from Bombay.
Kachumber Salad: A refreshing and citrus salad to help with the palette cleanse between the heavier meal dishes
Lamb Samosas: Your classic samosas but with Keema instead.
Pau Bhaji: Just comfort food for Indians but the burst of flavors is bound to make anyone hungrier for more.
Malai Kulfi for dessert: This is the one item that is pretty good but can't beat India.  It's certainly good and will hit that kulfi craving.",1
5,"Amazing food. Great staff. The house chai is really good. I loved how fresh everything was, the fresh chili's were very delicious. The ruby chicken had large pieces of chicken breast that was very yummy. Definitely worth the wait. Go for lunch hours to beat the long hour+ wait though.",1
5,My husband and I wanted to try this restaurant based on its yelp reviews and we were not let down. This was the best Indian food that we've ever had. Ever.,1
5,"Fantastic. The que outside almost scared us away, but it was well worth the 45 minute wait. We actually went back about two days later while on our tour of London. The food is amazing but honestly I was in awe of how well this the restaurant was managed. Their systems in place and training is some of the best I've ever seen. This is one of the best all around restaurants I've ever been to.",1
4,"Food was great, atmosphere was great. The line was too long. We went after work, 6-10 PM ordeal. It's good but not that good to have to wait 2.5 hours to get seated. Staff is also incredibly nice.",1
5,"Great place great price. Order to you're heart's content and you won't go broke. Only problem is the wait so make reservations. If you can't, you still get a complimentary chai tea as you wait. On a cold day, it's definitely something you want. Don't know what to order? Don't worry, the staff is extremely helpful and patient in making sure that you know what you are ordering. Portions aren't that big, but for the price, it's still a great bargain. We ordered the prawn special and it was excellent. The flavors are well balanced and the prawn are fresh. We also made sure we ordered 2 naans to soak up the rest of the juices of the dish. This is how you should eat soupy dishes in my opinion.",1
4,"After waiting in line for more than an hour on a blustery, chilly London evening, I had high expectations and a roiling appetite. I was not disappointed. 
The chocolate chai and mint tea served to those waiting in line certainly warmed my insides. And then, the business begins. 
I ordered the black daal, lamb biryani, and the garlic naan. Our server thought I was ordering for my friend and I, but I just wanted to try everything! If I had the option to take leftovers home, I would've ordered the Ruby Chicken.
The daal was rich,  smoky and flavorful-- perfectly partnered with the naan! You forget it doesn't have meat. The lamb biryani had a subtle, slow-burning heat. It's the kind of meal that makes you say, ""that hit the spot!""
But as delightful as dinner was, I had to save room for dessert. I'm glad I did. The kulfi was so rich and creamy, it was almost chewy. It was almost custard.
If you are ever within the vicinity of this place, make sure you get in line! Build up an appetite and know it will be worth the wait!",1
5,"Holy moly this place is great. We arrived in London a little later, got there around 9.45 and only needed to wait 30 minutes for a table (normally is 2ish hours). We were served delicious hot chai in line and then guided down to the bar where we had a very friendly bartender make delicious cocktails. Once we were seated, service was attentive and friendly. We ordered the lamb samosas (must have!), dishoom chicken (another must have!), chicken ruby and the signature bean sauce. Everything was delicious- this place definitely lived up to the hype!",1
5,"Holy moly Dishoom!  What can I say about Dishoom that hasn't already been said??  The absolute highlight of my visit to London culinarily.  Do not be turned off by the long lines at the door, they have the waiting down to a science.  Some reviews on here have suggested that the mandatory wait at the bar is a bit of a scam.  I don't know about you all, but when I go to dinner, I want to get down to eating as soon as possible.  Would much rather wait at their cozy bar with a tasty Bombay Martini and some appetizers than outside in the cold English night. I have been to each of their locations in London and walking in to the Indian music from the 60's and incense burning in the corner instantly transports you.",1
4,"THIS PLACE IS SO COOL! 4.5 stars.
I came with my boyfriend around 2pm on a Tuesday and it was full, but there wasn't a very long line. We were seated in the downstairs bar area to wait, and soon enough had a table. The decor is LOVELY and quite stunning and gives the whole place a great feel. The service is also great!
Pricing seems very fair, and the quality is wonderful. They are also quick to bring out dishes, too! Wonderful execution. 
We shared: 
-lamb samosas. YES. Just yes. So flavorful and perfect. So comforting. SO good. The sauces they provide as well are just great. 
-Garlic naan. Kind of cliche, but still super tasty. It was fluffy and flavorful and not TOO garlicky. Love. 
-Ruby chicken. This was somewhat spicy but warming and comforting and flavorful. I was super into this. 
-Chicken biryani. YES. JUST YES. This is so good. So flavorful and lovely and would go super well with raita. 
-Chai. This is next level chai. AND they give free refills! It's comforting (a theme here) and spicy in the best way. It is delightful.
All in all, this is a great place and if I lived in London, I'd come here all the time. It's not the BEST Indian food I have ever had, but is ROCK solid and the whole experience is VERY nice. 
PS: The above dishes was a LOT to handle for 2 people. Be warned. No regrets!",1
5,"Visiting from the US and staying a couple blocks away. This place is a no brainer. Book it or arrive an hour before you want to eat. They have the wait process down to a science. Put your name in, you are greeted by name after a partial wait outside, then sent to the bar where seats are waiting for you and you are greeted by name again to have a drink and finish your wait. Service once you are seated is fast and efficient. All our choices were fantastic: veg somosas, lamb chops, chicken Tikka, black Dahl, chicken ruby, Naan and roti.",1
5,"Wonderful Indian food.  There is always a line in front.  A word of advice, Dishoom does take reservations on-line before 6 pm. Do this a week before and you can bypass the long line of tourist in front. Favorite dishes include the chicken ruby, grilled lamb chops and don't forget the garlic naan!",1
4,"I walked around forever just to find this place considering my phone was dead, so this one was definitely an adventure. I'm glad i came though, yummy Indian food!
-------------------------------------------------------
FOOD:
Lamb Samosas: 4/5, We got this while we were waiting for our table at the bar. It was perfectly seasoned and a really good appetizer. You get three pieces so it's pretty small but definitely tasty!
House Black Dal: 4/5, It was another really good item! Very different dal than what I usually have. Usually I get yellow dal but this one had much more full lentils and slightly thicker. I'm a big fan of lentil soup so I definitely recommend!
Chole Batura: 5/5, This was my favorite meal of the night! The bread that comes alone with it is absolutely delicious, even better than the naan. It was a sizable portion and gave a very fresh feeling. Definitely get this dish!
Chicken Ruby: 4/5, Another very decent dish. There wasn't anything wrong with it but it didn't stand out too much. It tasted very classic, so I would recommend getting it if you like chicken!
Dishoom Chocolate Pudding: 4/5, This had a very very unique taste. I've never had a chili ice cream and it doesn't hit you at first, but the aftertaste is spicy. Although it wasn't 100% my style I would still recommend just because of how different it was.
Naan: 5/5, I love naan and all the variations of naan here were delicious!
-------------------------------------------------------
PRICE:
Lamb Samosas: 4.90 Pounds
House Black Dal: 5.90
Chole Batura: 8.90 Pounds
Chicken Ruby: 8.50 Pounds
Dishoom Chocolate Pudding: 6.90
Naan: 2.50 Pounds
Cheese Naan: 3.20 Pounds
-------------------------------------------------------
SERVICE:
4/5, It took like 30-45 minutes of waiting outside and another 15 minutes of waiting at the bar to get a table. It was definitely a very popular place, but once we got a table, they were very fast about getting our food to us! 
-------------------------------------------------------
AMBIANCE:
5/5, Very nice ambiance, definitely a little more classy but not too fancy. Can't really come in casual clothing, but it doesn't have to be too formal. Very good for a date!
-------------------------------------------------------
OVERALL:
I definitely recommend coming if you're a fan of Indian food or want to go on a nice date!",1
3,"I think this is overrated. Stood in line for almost an hour and got in. Ordered Wada Pav, Kali Dal and Paneer Roll. Kali Dal was okay not over the top as other reviews are saying. Same for Wada Pav and Paneer roll. Definitely overpriced IMHO",-1
5,"My first time in London, first meal in London, and first time stepping foot in a modernized traditional Bombay-style cafe. Dishoom is beyond any Indian food I have tasted in the U.S. and has elevated my Indian food experience and a spectacular culinary treat. Despite the long queue, staff were very welcoming and friendly. At one point, the host came out to personally chat with us and the hostess even offered hot Indian tea and beverages for the awaiting guests. 
Well known for their breakfast and buzz for their fried eggs and Bacon Naan Roll, we arrived for dinner instead. Our waiter, Ali, was so helpful in explaining the menu, as everything just sounded so inviting and delicious. We ordered a full table, starting with the Bhang Lassi and Mango & Fennel Lassi drinks. Indian food is best eaten with Lassi as it balances the heat and spice from the curry. For the entrees, we tried the House Black Daal, Chicken Ruby (tender chicken in makhani sauce), Sheekh Kabab (grilled lamb) and dipping Raita (minty cucumber yogurt). I would recommend getting two orders of the stonefire Naan or the steamed Basmati Rice for dipping and mopping the rich, silky curry sauces. Ali also brought out 3 house-made dipping sauces, which really brings out the flavor of the meat dishes. 
Mouthwatering food and drinks, stellar customer service, clean and charming restaurant decor, all located right in the heart of London. Dishoom is so worth the 13 hour flight from San Diego. Cheers/Chiyars!",1
5,"BEST INDIAN RESTAURANT AND EXPERIENCE. We were seated at the bar while we waited for a table and the drinks were extremely well done. When we were seated, it was close to the man making the naan in the kitchen and it was so fun to watch him in action. The food and chutney was so good! We got the DISHOOM calamari, naan (plain and garlic), DISHOOM chicken tikka and prawn moilee. Can't say a single bad thing about any of the dishes because they were so good and they kept filling our chutneys.",1
5,"One of the best Indian restaurants in London (maybe one of the Indian restaurants in the world), and worth the wait! Don't come here unless you're willing to wait in line for 45-90 minutes, but on the plus side, they have space heaters outside to keep you warm, give you complementary chai, and they have free WiFi. So it could definitely be worse. I came here on a Friday night and waited in line outside for about an hour, and then moved downstairs with a buzzer where I had to wait for another 30 min or so. At least once you went inside and downstairs, you could order a drink and some appetizers, so it wasn't quite as bad. The line felt a little like DisneyWorld where you move to different waiting areas to help pass the time quicker with a change of scenery.
LAMB SAMOSAS (£4.90) - Delicious samosas, I don't normally like lamb but I liked these a lot. The outside was nice, flaky and light, made with phyllo dough and not heavy. There were 3 of them and they were delicious. I would recommend.
OKRA FRIES - (£4.20) - These were thin slices of okra cut into fries, and lightly covered with batter and spices. I like both appetizers but I liked these a touch more than the Samosas. It went well with the drinks. Would recommend these, I didn't want the bowl of these to end!
AU BHAJI (£4.50) - A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered pau bun. The description doesn't really do this dish justice, but it was our favorite one of the bunch. There were 2 fresh, hot, buttered rolls and a bowl of vegetables that were mashed with spices. It doesn't sound that great, but it was so good, hearty, and comforting. Don't miss this one. 
BLACK HOUSE DAAL (£5.90) - I know this is a signature dish of lentils simmered for 24 hours, and it was good - I would definitely eat it again, but it was probably my least favorite of the bunch.
CHICKEN RUBY (£8.50) - The curry was well done and the chicken was cooked well - spicy, but not too spicy. Definitely worth ordering if you like curry dishes. We ate this with naan and rice, but I'm sure it would be delicious with roti.
GARLIC NAAN: Fluffy, fresh, and delicious. I'd recommend getting at least one order for the table. I wanted to get the Roti also, but between the naan and rice, we had sufficient carbs for the table.
DISHOOM CHOCOLATE PUDDING (£6.90) - I loved this dessert a lot, but I like chocolate cake and spicy things, so the combo of a warm chocolate cake and a scoop of chili ice cream was my perfect combination. The chili ice cream is not as odd as you may think - it just has a hint of spiciness. 
Overall, such a fantastic meal at reasonable prices. Quality food, so many options to choose from, and even the long line was made better by being able to go downstairs and get drinks/appetizers, having free chai, and WiFi. I'd come back here on every trip to London and can't wait to have breakfast here one day. Brace yourself for the wait and make sure to add this on your list of places to eat in London.",1
3,"This shop was super busy and I Waited for 1hour to get my food on table. Service was good while food has no any surprise. Among all the Indian restaurants I have ever tried, this one is just at average level.
I won't say it's worth your spending life to wait for half or one hour. 
However, to be fair, this is one of the best food I had in this London trip so far....considering London is a good food desert, this restaurant to get high score is quite reasonable.",-1
5,"Had an amazing meal at Dishoom! Wonderful flavors and many dishes that were not too spicy - our 12 year old really enjoyed! We had the Veggie somosas, chicken tikka, ruby chicken, biriyani and daal.  Drink menu was extensive and interesting!  Would definitely come back again!",1
5,"I've always seen the queues in front and wondered what the hype is and finally had the opportunity tonight to learn first hand. The food is truly outstanding. I've always been a fan of Indian food and thought we had some great options in LA and an occasional visit to an Indian place in Manchester or London, however this is a fresh take on the real deal. Very inventive while still embracing the authentic tastes. I ordered the Mahi Tikka along with Pau Bhaji which was just absolutely perfect. I tried sampling as much as I could without overstuffing myself. Don't skip the Paneer Roll and of course an order of Naan. Everything on the menu looked amazing. I would say its perhaps the best food I've had in London in a long time!",1
4,"The name Dishoom is the Indian movie equivalent of KAPOW! in superhero comics - the amplified sound (particularly in movies of 70s and 80s) when the fist of the hero connected with the face of the villain. Not sure who the villain is in this case, but the restaurant has certainly connected with the public, and now has five locations.
Students of business broadly, and positioning in particular, should find Dishoom as a fascinating case study. Not simply for creating demand that no one knew existed (the Brits are unlikely to tire of the Curry House format anytime soon), but for educating and convincing people that their lives had been incomplete without it!
 Dishoom is more than the sum of its parts. Yes, it is a very competent and affordable restaurant for lunch and dinner, but it is also one which explicitly positioned itself as a breakfast destination, as opposed to treating it as an afterthought to cover the costs for premises.
 For those who don't know, this was done by intelligently leveraging human nostalgia for the past and modeling their (scalable) business after the Irani cafes in Bombay (now Mumbai) popular in the Twentieth century, but whose numbers have dwindled considerably in the last decades. As background, Irani cafes were all day cafes inspired by the European coffee houses, and were places where people from all stratas of life could lounge all day, should they so choose, engaging in activities as diverse from reading the newspaper, writing their literary masterpiece, or just taking a break from the humdrum of the office. In my minds' eye, I can visualize a room large enough to be a banquet hall, decorated with family portraits, ceiling fans blowing air to provide patrons respite from the hot and humid summer day... so you can see, you can cut the romanticism with a knife.
But, here's the anomaly: the people who're seated here are basically foodies (pardon the word usage) and Indians, not necessarily mutually exclusive, with almost no one who would remember personally going to the cafes in now Mumbai. Nor would anyone confuse the patrons here for Bob Dylan (hey, he's a Nobel Prize winner now!).  Despite the meticulous set design, there's no slice of old Bombay here - but that's the magic of the positioning, as opposed to serious culinary chops, that no one pays any attention to that.
Enough backdrop, the food is good (at times: excellent), but uneven with lots of misses in my 3 visits. My favorite menu items from the all day menu include the Masala Prawns, the spicy lamb chops, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and Keema Pau (popular menu item at the Irani cafes).  For breakfast, I've liked the Kejriwal (fried eggs on chilli cheese toast) and Keema Per Eedu (chicken keema, chicken liver, fried eggs, and crisp chips). When it comes to drinks, they have quite a few innovative ones on their menu, e.g. Bhang Lassi (with/without rum) with ginger, almond syrup, yogurt, fennel sprinkles. The one I liked more was the Mango and Fennel Lassi. But, I've yet to like any dessert here, particularly iced things whether in a glass (gola ice) or a stick (kulfi). While I was tempted, I decided not to try the cream, meringue and strawberries dessert (Memsahib's mess). I saw it at a neighboring table and it certainly looked heavy enough to knock one out with a solid Dishoom...",1
4,"Fun menu. Delicious drinks. Great hosting staff (waiter was ok). Cute decor. 
I wouldn't wait more than an hour to get it, which seems to be about the norm during peak times. But it was good to try at least once.",1
5,"Dishoom! Lives up to its expectation and ratings... Is it an overpriced place? YES.. Is is always crowded? YES.. Does it live up to all the hype it's created? YES.. Is it worth it? Dishoom! YES!
Thanks to fellow Yelper's who made the decision extremely easy for what to order... Priced a bit on the expensive side for the really small portions you get... it might annoy you to find a small little bowl of Okra Fries (£3.70) and Prawn Koliwada (£5.90).. But have a bit of these extremely well seasoned appetizers... and ... DISHOOM! They got it spot on.. Really nice flavor and you'll definitely enjoy it!
For entrees... Chicken Ruby is clearly a winner. We saw a few tables order Biryani and Choley Bhatura too; but most of them were hogging on the really delicious (albeit smaller portions) of this dish.. again, priced a bit on the steeper end at £8.20. Roomali Roti's go extremely well.. so definitely recommend that!
Few things to remember.. they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait! We waited ~50 minutes on a Wed night at 7:20. After we got in, they strategically send you downstairs to their bar where they'd expect you to spend a few more £££'s on drinks.. in about 15 minutes, you'd be taken to your table. For a place already minting money, this was a bit unnecessary in my opinion!
Service wise, no complaints! In fact, the food comes out really quick after placing your order. We got our food within 10 minutes! Definitely a must experience place for the Desi & Videsi crowd ;-)",1
5,"My husband and I came here for dinner on a recent trip to the UK. We arrived around 5:30 PM and had to wait over an hour and a half to get in... But it was totally worth it. 
It was a cold and blustery day (don't worry, this isn't the start of a Gothic romance), and the waitstaff kindly provided mini cups of steaming hot chai and mint tea to warm us while we waited. Once we got in, my husband and I were seated downstairs at a tiny two seater table. Our waiter helped us make sense of the extensive menu and together, we put together a lovely meal. We had the lamb biryani (best I've ever had) paired with a light yogurt dip to cut the heat. We also has veggie samosas and fried okra. YUM. Everything was super and I was extremely impressed with the quality of the food. We washed down our delicious meal with a glass of mango lassi (also terrific). 
If you have the chance to visit, please do. It's well worth the wait. Oh, and the WC was pretty clean, too.",1
5,"wow wow wow. this place is amazzzzzing. from the service, food, and atmosphere. it was an absolute experience. my favorite dishes were the vegetable samosa and chicken tikka.",1
4,"Great Indian food, very nice atmosphere and prices are great! I would suggest having a reservation specially during the weekends because it tends to be big lines. 
Been there many times, if you don't like spicy food there aren't really meany options that are not spicy but I would give it a try!
Recommended dish: Lamb Biryani and Lamb Samosas",1
2,"I'm not certain what is the hype about. This is far from being a good indian place. The curry sauce tasted like italian tomato sauce with a touch of indian flavor, lacking the depth and richness of true indian dish. I must admit the naan bread and roti were very good otherwise I would've given them 1 star. If you want to experience indian food go where locals eat but this one is geared for tourists who unlikely to come back.",-1
5,This is the best Indian food in London!! I am so happy my husband and I found this place. What a lunch feast to remember lol  It's interesting how different their Chicken tikka masala compared to ours here in the US. Dishoom is definitely the highlight of our food trip in London. Come early to avoid the long wait.,1
5,"I'm from the states so my opinion may be hindered due to the fact that Indian/Pakistani restaurants here are on a whole other level (way better here than the states).
This place got 5 stars and we had a one hour twenty minute wait, so that should tell you something. We killed the starters. The lamb samosas were very simple and tasty. The best starters were the lamb boti and lamb chops. The kabab were also very great however the boti and chops were my favorite.
We all got full off of the starters so shared the chicken curry dish which was good too...
We got seated downstairs however if you want more of an experience I would suggest to be asked to be seated upstairs. The service was great as well.",1
5,"Incredible! 
Long wait times are always a pain, but you know it is going to be good! Definitely worth the wait and once you're inside the bar can keep you busy!
The food and service is amazing, I especially love the biryani. It may not be like the typical family run Indian restaurants in London but it is definitely a great change and the food quality is perfection.",1
5,"I'll start with the bad - 1 hour 30 minute wait on a Friday night. That's all the bad. Now the good. They brought a delicious chai tea mint drink to people waiting to get in. Nice to have during the chilly wait. The food was amazing! The chicken tikka was very spicy for us since we're from the Pacific Northwest. My fiancé couldn't eat it but I ate it all using rice and my delicious cocktail to eat it all up! The black daal was out of this world, as was the lamb kofkta kabob. The caramel ice cream was pretty good. I wasn't a huge fan of my meringue, cream, and berry dessert, but it was still interesting and I'm glad I tried it! Super delicious overall! If you have the time for the wait, try it!",1
5,"I'm not a huge fan of indian food, but decided to come here with my son who likes Indian food.  The food was pretty amazing, the place is very clean, the serive is very efficient and the prices are very good.
You might want to make a reservation.  The queue gets long",1
5,Excellent curry! Exactly what we needed for making up for the bad british foodwe had been eating!,1
5,"I would give this restaurant more than 5 stars if I could. Their food is exceptional, the service is outstanding, and if I were local, I would eat here all the time (on one short vacation, we dined here 3 times in 2 days). 
London prides itself on its Indian food, but the Indian food I've usually eaten had tastes a little different from what you get in restaurants in the U.S. or India. I've come to think of it as its own category: ""London Indian"" (sort of like ""Indian Chinese"" or ""American Chinese"" food). Dishoom's food is incredibly Mumbai-authentic (from the chai to the the oh-so-delicious chutneys), executed with really high quality ingredients. 
In particular, I'd recommend the jackfruit biryani (rice casserole with raisins and cooked jackfruit -- a vegetarian alternative to chicken... it looks like chicken but tastes sort of like artichoke hearts). The tikka chicken wrap was amazingly delicious (actually, the balance of flavors wrapped in that thin, papery roti reminded me of mooshu chicken), and my Indian husband declared the bhel puri the best he'd had outside of India. The line for lunch and dinner can get very long (45 minutes for lunch or just over an hour for dinner), so try to come a little early (just before noon for lunch) or make a reservation.",1
5,"I can not believe what delicious food we had!  I'll be back every day this week despite the hour wait outside in the rain.  It's that good.  Ruby Chicken, Black Daal, Raita, cheese naan, and some sort of potatoes with ""an addictive chemical that makes me crave it fortnightly!""  Do not miss while in London!! But don't wait on queue in front of me .  They brought us deliciously warm chai tea while we waited outside - and they were attentive to us on queue by keeping us apprised of our personal wait time.",1
4,"Went for breakfast, super yummy. Great Chai too. J keep meaning to make this my breakfast work spot, particularly the Carnaby street location as it's rather large, but it's always a wee bit too far away. Shame.",1
5,"Came here for lunch and Dishoom did not disappoint. It was the best meal I had while staying in London. I ordered the Spicy Lamb Chops, Chicken Ruby, Black House Daal, Garlic Naan, and Jasmine Rice. Everything I ordered, I would order again upon returning to this restaurant. I definitely recommend ordering a variety of dishes from the menu. Also their traditional Chai is a must-order -- they're bottomless until 5PM!",1
5,"I've only been to this location for breakfast but at 11am on a Thursday it was already pretty busy. And for good reason - the food is absolutely delicious. We ordered the sausage naan roll (my favorite), kejriwal, bun maska and chai. The portions are just right and all the food was cooked perfectly. The waiter was also very attentive and was alway quick to refill the chai. Very clean and bright interior.",1
5,"We were referred here by several people before arriving in London, and we were not disappointed. Great food! It is worth the wait (if there is a line), we promise! We are dreaming about the food... it is a must when in London!",1
5,"I'll be honest: I did NOT want to like this place. My husband is a big fan of Indian food, and once he received multiple recommendations for this place, he begged me to go with him. When we arrived, the line was LONG. I live in a small town without any lines, so having a 1.5+ hour wait was difficult for me. They did serve us complimentary chai tea & ginger milk, which was nice. Once we got to the front of the line, we were sent into the restaurant and directed to the bar downstairs to a separate waiting area. We got drinks--which were great; lots of options--and then when our table was ready, we were brought to have our dinner. The waitress was extremely helpful and gave great advice as to what we should order. We ended up choosing several of her suggestions, and it was one of the best meals I have ever had. The naan, the lamb, the chicken, the vegetables--it was all incredible. In addition to the excellent food, I also want to note that the restaurant was EXTREMELY well-organized. Going from staff member to staff member on our way to ultimately sitting down to dinner, everyone knew exactly what was going on, and they were very professional and respectful. There's a reason this restaurant is so highly reviewed: These people know how to run a business!",1
5,"I recently have come to really like Indian food, so going to Dishoom while in London was a must. My friend and I stood in line for a half hour, but I came in knowing there'd be a long queue. The staff knew too, and were equipped with complimentary sherry and chai tea for the guests in the queue. We were led downstairs to the bar where we ordered drinks first. My friend got an old fashioned and I had a blended orange drink. We were both very satisfied with our choices! Soon we were led to our table and we ordered a bunch of food- lamb biryani, ruby chicken curry, house black daahl, garlic naan, roti, okra fries with incredible dipping sauce and a side of basmati rice. Oh my god. So good. Everything was absolutely amazing. I wouldn't change a thing the next time we come to Dishoom, the curries were rich and flavorful, the lamb biryani was excellent, the lamb was SO tender, the daahl was the perfect balance between the two. Truly an experience and I can't wait to come back!!",1
5,"Came in on a Monday around 5 pm without reservations and it only took bout 25 minutes to get seated.
The staff here all go above and beyond and I'd say this was my favorite restaurant to eat at in London.
They bring out some tea while you wait in line outside, then take you downstairs to the bar to wait for your table. Once a table is open someone comes down to the bar to bring you back up and get you seated.
The food is absolutely delicious. After eating ""traditional food"" for two days I would've killed to have something with spice on it and this place delivered.
I'm sure everyone's covered how good the food is compared to what else is available in the city. So aside from that I just want to say the staff here is absolutely awesome. It was a great experience and I'd happily come back.",1
5,"Incredible food. The best food I've honestly had during my week in London. Cheap, delicious and a great trendy ambience as well. What more can you ask for?",1
5,"There was a wait but it was still amazing. My boyfriend and I ended up sitting at a smaller table but that was fine :) 
The food was so flavorful. It looked small but by the end my stomach was so full. The servers are super attentive and very kind. 
The wait wasn't very long either. 
The drink was really good. I had Thumbs Up. I definitely recommend.",1
4,"Oooh the chicken ruby dish here has changed the way I think about my chicken in Indian food and curries. 
Recently I'd been finding myself avoiding chicken at Indian restaurants (in America) because of how hard I've been finding the pieces - like solid, blocks of tough meat that became a nuisance to bite into. Even in places that people rave about, I've found chicken to be unfortunately blah after countless times.
So I was a little wary to have chicken here, but I was also curious to see how it would compare. The waiter wasn't particularly helpful really, but one of the things he did list was the chicken ruby. So after some indecision, I decided on that and roti (a recommended pair on the menu), and chai tea. 
So worth the roughly hour-long wait in line (I arrived around 5 pm on a Wednesday). The chicken was tender and broke off easily with fork in one hand. The curry was so complex (it had a good balance of spice and it wasn't too sweet as if simply tomato soup or heavily tomato-based).
The roti did pair really well with it, soaking it all up. And it was the perfect amount together, which I find rare! Initially it might look like you don't have enough of one or the other, but no worries, ends up striking a nice balance and being filling.",1
5,Best Indian restaurant in London!! Yum food and nice stuff  I would recommend everyone who loves Indian food to go there....,1
5,"Delicious! Everything ordered tasted fantastic, fresh and extremely flavorful.
The servers worked as a team and anticipated our needs before requested.
Worth the wait!",1
4,"The food was solid. I had the okra fries, mahi tikka, and bowl of greens. 
Okra fries - split in half so more crispy edges. The batter was thin and nicely spiced. It went well with sauce trio they serve along with it. 
Mahi tikka - the fish was tender and flavorful. Squeeze of lime + fresh cilantro + the orange sauce of the trio = combined flavors for a really delicious bite. 
Bowl of greens - the flavors of chili and lime were absolutely delicious. The veggies were also not overcooked, so the broccoli, snap peas, and spinach all had a nice crunchy texture. Just wish it was a bit less oily. 
A quick comment to solo business travelers:
We are not tourists, it's not a family vacation, so a lot of times we revert to solo dining at the bar. As a giant FYI, they still make you wait along with everyone else, which for me was brutal bc I'm battling a cough and we were standing outside in the cold. Thankfully there was hot tea served. Also, their bar is not conducive to dining - only drinks and finger food. 
As a result, I am sitting at a table that seems to have been set up as an afterthought in the rear corner of the downstairs dining area. Fine by me, just less ideal that the social, energetic experience of sitting at the bar. 
Chicken Tikka Masala is UK's national cuisine, so naturally I opted to try the nearest top rated restaurant for this dish. Overall, delicious. Just wasn't too thrilled with the host process.",1
5,"Yes, the wait is real.  Check in with the dude with the iPad and find your place in line and plan to wait.  We were quoted 1.5 hours Saturday night for three people, and we got in at about 1 hour.  
The roti is perfection.  Their chicken entrees are crazy flavorful. Loved their bread with cheese and chives.  The fish kebabs were also flavorful.  The daal which is what they've been heralded for was actually my least favorite dish out. 
Basically order whatever your serve recommends and is in a box on the menu -  you can't go wrong!",1
5,"Lovely place, excellent service and attentive staff. Didn't have to wait long during the day, but you may find a long queue during peak hours (lunch and dinner timings)
Had the Pau Bhaji for starters (signature dish) Awadhi Lamb Biryani for and Chicken Tika for mains. More than enough for two!
Food came within 10minutes, thoroughly enjoyed my meals here. Staff were really friendly and attentive  Seems like a good place for friends and family.
Price: Depending on the size of your wallet, I found this a little pricey but worth the money",1
5,Amazing food! I reallly enjoyed my experience here in London. Service was super fast! There is always a wait cause it's that good!!! It was cold outside and they greeted us with chai while we waited. It was so nice! Their lamb chops and biryani was amazing!,1
4,"If only the line were shorter! I came here by recommendation from a local, although she had recommended a different location. It happened that this location was close to where we were, so we just went here. Little did we know this is not only the original location, but also the smallest location! Thus the line was quite out of control. We really wanted some good Indian food before we left London, and so we stood on line. At least they were serving chai, mint tea and shiraz while you waited on line. The chai was quite good. When we finally were seated, the food did not disappoint! Everything we had was delicious, and the service was good. In fact, the food was so good, my husband even ordered an extra dish. Really, the worst thing is the wait. Next time I would try another location.",1
5,"In town on my birthday, I knew I wanted to eat some yummy Indian food. Did a quick search on Yelp and found Dishoom. 4.5 stars with over 800 reviews cannot be wrong so we headed over to wait in the que. We arrived just before 1800 on a Thursday and waited a total of 53 minutes for a table for two. We chatted with fellow travelers and enjoyed the complimentary chai tea we were served in line. Once we were seated, things moved quickly. Our waiter did an outstanding job. After we ordered, he made a few recommendations on how we could round out our meal and he was spot on.  Everything was delicious and easily some of the best Indian food I have had to date. Items were cooked to perfection and I loved the use of fresh herbs with our main entrées. We were able to try the Okra Fries £4.20, Spicy Lamb Chops £11.90, House Black Daal £5.90 (amazing!), Dishoom Chicken Tikka £7.90 and the Lamb Samosas £4.90. Everything here is done to the nines but the House Black Daal is necessary when you visit. The evening was perfect and I was very happy to celebrate my birthday here. Do yourself a favor and visit them if you are looking to enjoy an excellent meal.",1
1,"Don't waste your money. Service was average and we went at non-peak hours with very few other tables there. The food was incredibly underwhelming, very inauthentic. There were very little spices and nothing tasted like the many Indian restaurants I have enjoyed in the past. Of the many dishes we ordered, not one of them was memorable. The portions are tiny, and the prices are pretty ridiculous in my opinion (we paid about 35£/person and we're all very hungry after). If you are looking for real Indian food, skip Dishoom. Dishoom doesn't have the ambiance, tastes, smells, or service that its prices reflect or of a quality Indian restaurant. Pass on Dishoom, London has excellent Indian food elsewhere for half the price that is far better and more filling. 
TLDR; expensive, bland dishes, small portions, average service.",-1
5,"Ok. This place was amazing. The flavors are outstanding. My wife and I had the chicken ruby with a side of basmati rice and roti bread. Best Indian food we've ever had. Ever. We also ordered the daal, which was very good (but less flavorful than we expected). 
The wait for dinner is normally very long, so we came for lunch on a Tuesday. No wait, but we were lucky!
Do not miss your chance to eat here. Yum!!!!!!",1
5,"Great!! We had to wait for about 30 minutes for our seat but it was very pleasant. We were given the WiFi network and lemonade while we waited in line and then were taken down to the bar area for the remainder of the wait. The Chicken Ruby was amazing, basically tiki masala and we even ordered the Dishoom Chocolate Pudding for dessert which was also great. The staff were extremely nice and I  totally recommend this restaurant... great experience.",1
5,Well worth the wait!!!! The food was delicious and the service was of the utmost quality!! Would recommend to anyone looking for good Indian food while in london!,1
5,Absolutely delicious with excellent service and a lovely interior. We stayed for 3 hours and enjoyed every minute of it!,1
5,"Some of the best Indian I've had. Delicious naan! Not a lot of curries to choose from, but the chicken ruby was delicious!
Came for lunch around 13 and ""only"" had to wait 15-ish minutes - definitely worth it. But make sure to book in advance for evening dinners.",1
5,"Don't wait in the hour plus line, instead make a reservation online a day before! 
This is one of the more popular Indian restaurant in London and a favorite of my office that's around the block. It's a bit more expensive but everyone raves it's the best Indian food they've had (even my coworker who only eats Mexican and was afraid to try the food loved it!!!). 
The ambiance was particularly trendy and the decor was modern. They have a nice variety of drinks with good service. You can't go wrong with a the highlight on the Yelp reviews or just ask your wait staff for some favorites. I would recommend coming here if you are craving some food Indian food.",1
5,Excellent Indian cuisine in a great setting in Edinburgh. Worth a walk for lunch. Right at St. Andrews square.,1
5,"One of the very best Indian restaurants ever. Waiting times can be up one hour long, but it is well worth the wait. Chicken curry was very tender and mango lassi was spectacular.",1
5,Fantastic restaurant great food definitely worth the wait. The jack fruit biriyani is fantastic and the service is fast and polite. Expect to queue for about 40mins to get in  during busy periods but would recommend it.,1
5,"Yelp peeps, yes!  You were spot on about this joint. Thank you!
Upon arrival we were informed of a 1h wait.  The queue winds around outside however heat lamps are provided but must be in close proximity to benefit.  The wait ultimately was less than 1h.  Woot! Under promise, over deliver!
Two Dishoom employees, who seemed to be focused on our satisfaction, came by frequently to offer complimentary warm chai tea as we waited.  This was a delightful and much needed touch on a cold winter/spring night. 
The service all around was top notch and highly attentive. 
My main dish - Chicken Ruby- was incredible; so incredible I toyed with the idea of ordering another round (the overstuffed feeling was the only reason I didn't). The dish displayed a delicate balance of spice, tinge of sweetness, and tender, delicious chicken.
The prawn dish was ok, the dipping sauce provided with the plate added the extra needed kick.  I wouldn't order this again if I were to return.
The vegetable samosas were forgettable.  Seemed to taste like nothing but fried oil.
Cheese Naan bread- yes! Ten times over yes!  I used the naan bread to mop up the Chicken Ruby however it's so good on its own too.
Pro tip:  do not check nutrition facts of naan bread whilst eating said naan bread.",1
4,"It wasn't even 5 pm and this place had a line outside already.  Granted, this resto is smack dab in the middle of tourist mecca in London, so you really can't fault it for brimming with tourists. With all the accolades it has received at Yelp, Zagat and TripAdvisor to name a few, a long wait here is inevitable. 
We got lucky though 'cause we only waited about 45 minutes to get seated (with only 6 couples of in front of us or so it seemed).  Reservations for dinner are only taken for groups of 6 diners or more.  But here's the 411 on the seating process, just in case you think you're close to being seated when you reach the front of the line (you're not): You stand in line outside, and when you get to the front of the line, they may call you in inside and sit on the chair by the hostess podium, or they may just call you in and lead you directly to the bar downstairs to their basement, where they encourage you to get a drink, and where you have to wait some more. We ordered a couple of drinks (a Virgin Bombay Colada for me and a Nimbu Pani for the hubby), and studied the menu while waiting another 20 minutes down there. 
We were eventually seated just on the other side of the bar area.  This place is tight, so you will definitely be in on the conversation of the people next to you, whether you like it or not.  Here are the items we ordered:
Naan--a bit disappointing.  It wasn't piping hot when it reached our table.  No blisters on it like it usually has and it wasn't elastic in texture.  More like a flatbread than a traditional naan. We should have sent it back and gotten a hot off the oven one.
Dishoom Calamari--nice flavor, tender, but a little greasy.  A small portion but perfect for two people sharing. 
Kacchi Lamb Biryani--good dish, nicely spiced, very tender lamb chunks underneath the rice.  
Kacchi Lamb Chops--ordered and enjoyed by the hubby.  The marinade has penetrated the meat and you get a very flavorful and tender bite. Enough for 1 person.
Raita--good accompaniment for all the dishes we had and will cool your palate.
We did not have dessert.  We were just too full from our dinner.  Service was friendly and good.  When we were standing in line outside the restaurant, a staff member came by with small glasses of Nimbu Pani (essentially a lemonade).  It was a warm day, so it was definitely welcome and refreshing. They're open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so they don't close down at all in the afternoon.  If you can go in the afternoon, the wait times may be better.  When we were leaving the restaurant, the line was pretty bad.  There must have been over 15 parties in line. As good as their food is, I wouldn't wait in that line.  You're better off trying a mom and pop Indian restaurant that probably has as good, if not better food than this restaurant.",1
3,"We didn't love this.  The space was a bit overwhelming, the food was OK, and the drinks were too sweet.  It seemed like a restaurant that received way too much hype and couldn't maintain their quality.  The service was also just bad; our waitress basically ignored us and we didn't receive our bill until almost an hour after requesting it.  The only standout item was the ruby chicken, but I would go to a traditional Indian restaurant for everything else.",-1
5,"The U.K. does a proper Indian. Bring a huge fan of Indian food, both the vegetarian buffet style you find in supermarkets at heavily Indian populated communities to the nouveau fusion (chicken tikka masala poutine whaaaaat?) American style, got to hand it to the Brits for what they do. This was one of our most delicious and memorable meals in London. 
Standouts

We liked the garlic naan more than the roti
Why is this restaurant so far away? It would definitely become part of the rotation.",1
5,"Oh man! We really to get unforgettable Indian food while in London. Boy, Dishoom did not disappoint! I literally have no pictures because we are everything before I remembered to take pics. First off they didn't take reservations but leave a pool of tables available for walk ups. While we waited in the queue, the hostess served us piping hot chai or mint tea since it was quite nippy out. Once you make it to the door, they take you down to the bar area so you can continue to wait for your table while having tasty drinks and snacks. The wait wasn't long; just long enough for one proper cocktail. Once at the table, we ordered straight away since we studied the menu while waiting in the queue. Appetizers included spicy corn like chips, veggie samosas and array of naan with dipping sauces. Gone in twenty secs. Main courses where chicken tikka with rice, lamb chops, and a grilled shrimp dish. Accompanied with a bowl of basmati rice, steamed veggies, and of course more naan. No one spoke. All we could do was make
Sounds of delight as we devoured each dish. No one crumb was left. The spices were so flavorful and fresh. The heat factor was definitely present in very dish, but that is why they recommend the yoghurt condiment on the side. It was a swirl wind of flavors; some familiar, but some very foreign and pleasant.  Dishoom satisfies our Indian hankering ten fold!",1
4,"I got here at 5pm on a Saturday night without a reservation and was told there was about 70 minute wait. Crazy, but the line kept getting longer behind me so I figured it was a good sign. They kept bringing out chai for the people in line too, which was really nice -- plus, I actually got inside into the bar after about 40 minutes, and actually seated maybe 15 after that. They definitely have their system down, which I appreciated. The food and service were all really good. Everything I tried was great, so I don't think you can go wrong with anything, but definitely check out the dishes highlighted on the menu in the little boxes -- I had the pau bhaji and house daal and loved the flavors in both. For main I went with a ""boring"" choice, chicken tikka, but it too was really great, with all of the flavors in perfect combination.",1
5,"My husband and I were in London for a long-weekend. I don't pretend to be an expert on Indian food at all, but I know good food, and this is it. We even went twice, when we're normally all about exploring new places, especially on vacation. 
This location always has a crazy line, even earlier in the evening, but they are so kind, and give free amazingly good chai tea and a sweet liquor that I didn't like but my husband did (I think it's a sherry variety). I noticed how they also seem to overestimate how long the line will take, so you are happy to be seated earlier (so they say 1 hour, it's really 45 minutes). 
To start, the food comes with 3 sauces. One is supposed to be more mild and is green and sweet. I loved it and found it very addictive. Another was more spicy, and my husband monopolized it. I don't remember what the third is, since we both were obsessed with our respective choices of sauce.
The garlic naan was addictive - warm and perfectly spiced. The masala prawns are also perfectly cooked and spiced.
I'm normally not that big of a fan of chicken (I think it's hard to cook well and is either too chewy or too undercooked, and usually not seasoned well). But here, the chicken tikka is perfect - tender, and perfectly seasoned with ginger and a delectable green sauce.
I also had the chaijito which was very good. Some flavored mojitos are terrible - overly sweet with no complex flavoring. This drink was not like that - it truly was a good mojito with complex chai spices, perhaps the same ones in their hot chai tea, which is also very good.  
All around great experience. Apparently it's a chain in London - wish it would come to New York!",1
5,"Love Dishoom, even with long waits as you can only book a table with a large party. Fun atmosphere, especially Kingscross and yummy Indian street food. Chicken Ruby is divine!",1
5,"By and large, London is known for having subpar food considering its status as a world class city. But the one culinary area they universally nail it is Indian food. Dishoom is a shining example of this. 
I've had my fair share of different Indian food styles. From upscale concepts to all-you-can-eat lunch buffets less than £10. Dishoom sort of does both. Elevated Indian fare that you'll pay something like £7 - £9 for. In a city that easily drain your bank account, it's a welcome respite. 
I had an array of different items from the menu. Many of which are identified in Yelp's review highlights. The black daal is special. The same goes for the the pau bhaji. But the star of the show was the ruby chicken. It belongs in some intersection of chicken tikka masala and a robust tomato stew. With juicy chunks of white meat chicken, it was understandable that everyone within a few tables of mine were ordering it with reckless abandon. Don't miss this if you know what's good for you.
Paired with this bounty was one of the most enjoyable Negronis I've had in months. Being that gin has a huge footprint in this city, they know their botanical-based libations.
One bugger is that you'll definitely have to wait to eat. Apparently the average wait is about 80 minutes. It's totally understandable that you'd rather just eat at Five Guys instead of standing around, but if you exercise patience you'll be rewarded.",1
5,"Best Indian. I just went to India for work a few months ago. It does not get better than this. We had the ruby chicken, black daal, garlic naan, house shrimp dish. Everything was delicious",1
5,"I dont usually wait in line too long but the reviews were so good and we were from out of town didnt want to miss opportunity, it was worth the hour wait. Food was incredible? I would call it gormet indian food. For me the best. Nan bread was fresh made and baked before your eyes. They were made very thin which was great.
Had chicken curry which was perfectly done and the most tender lambchops i have had at an restuarant.
Pricing is resonable for food and wsine.",1
5,"the best Indian food I ever had. I highly recommend  dishoom Tikka  delicious... the garlic naan bread also delicious, everything was perfect. Book a table, they get very busy.",1
5,"Great drinks and food. I love the chicken rubby and the garlic roti. Except to wait a while and have a difficult time getting a reservation, but once you are seated it is great. Don't let them seat you in the living room area. The food is really great.",1
4,"Excellent food! The service is quick but the wait in line is nearly 1.5 hours on a busy evening.
We stopped by our 1 day in London because it was close to where we were staying in Mayfair. We waited for about 1.5 hours to be seated, but they did bring us chai and tea while we were in line to keep us occupied. 
Seating inside is cramped if you don't get a booth. The decor is very well done. 
The portions are smaller then what you get stateside so be prepared to order more then you think you will need. Also, definitely get the gulfi at the end! It was delicious.",1
5,"This was my boyfriend and I's favorite meal during our stay in London. We arrived at 11:30 and were able to order the bacon naan (amazing) off the breakfast menu, followed by several items off the lunch menu, which begins at noon. Our favorite was the chicken ruby. Make sure you order a side of basmati rice as a base. The service was very good!",1
5,"Me and my partner when there for dinner, service was excellent and the food was amazing! It is however more expensive than other Indian restaurants in the area",1
5,"Excellent Indian with some Middle Eastern flares.  Comfortable atmosphere.  Very attentive service.  The Garlic naan and Chicken we our favorites.  We usually less than favor even some of the best considered Indian restaurants in California/US but, much like other similar establishments in London, we  always find London offers in this category to be always closest to original/genuine-authentic and tasty.  TIP:  make reservations or possibly prepare to wait 1-1.5 hours to get in!  On a cold winters might you may decide to not wait that long!",1
4,"Not being a London local, I happened upon this place thanks to Yelp. I came in for lunch on a Sunday and somehow avoid the typically long queue that form outside. I did still have a wait of  about 7-10 minutes in the wind and light rain, but they serve warm chai outside. A few things stuck out for me. 
You feel like you are entering a 4-5 star hotel or exclusive night club in the way they handle you. There are 2 door people who are outfitted with headsets. They take your name, after which the next 5 people will address you by name in the restaurant. 
Once you get past the door people, there is a mini reception. They address your party by name and let you know that there is a bar downstairs where you can wait till your table is ready. When you get downstairs, another reception greets your party by name and shows you to the bar. At the bar, the bartender crafts cocktails for you, takes your credit card and hands you a proxy card to take with you to your table. 
The table was ready in 5 minutes, while we were still sipping our drinks. When we arrived at our table, the host took our proxy card, again addressing our party by name. The food was very good. The service throughout was immaculate. The prices were very reasonable. 
Another interesting bit -- all of the service staff were from Europe (e.g. Spain, etc...) -- not an Indian in site, but the food was clearly cooked by Indian hands. 
Would definitely come again.",1
4,"I came to Dishoom on a Saturday night with three friends. This place is crazy busy, and they like to keep a line outside, so we joined the queue and waited. I think we were there by 7:15 or so, and got a table a bit before 9. Most of the wait was outside, until we finally made it into the bar. We ordered some cocktails, which were delicious. The pimms is actually too good, and was too easy to drink so we eventually switched to wine.
As we were 4, we decided to order a number of dishes to share. My friends got a few meat dishes (lamb chops, one coconut prawn curry, something with chicken) and we also shared dahl and a paneer curry, as well as rice, cheese naan, and some side salad-y cabbage-y dishes. Everything tasted really good, although it wasn't the best Indian food I've ever had. The portions were quite generous I thought, and by the end of the meal I was so full I could barely move. The service here was amazing- all of the staff were friendly, we never felt rushed (even though by 10:30 there was still a huge lineup outside), and our food came quite quickly, which was very welcome after having stood outside for ages. The ambiance is also great, especially when with a fun group. I don't know that I'd come here for a date, or just a one-on-one dinner as it's quite busy and loud, but with our group we had a great time.
I really enjoyed my evening here, but I don't think I would line up again for over an hour. The entire experience was great, but the food isn't worth a huge wait.",1
4,I had brunch here. Beware that brunch is until 11.00 (I think) and there is a long queue. So go early to make sure you get in there in time. I had the sausage roll which was really good. I def recommend going!,1
4,"he first time we were here, there was a waiting of an hour and we decided to pass on it. The second time after a wait of 30 mins we got a table. The place is nice , always packed with people. 
They have some bolloywood names to the drinks which is quite interesting. The service is quite good considering they are so busy.
I loved their keema pau . It had the right spice and was awesome. We also got chicken ruby which was oK (mild) .
They have a unique menu and must recommended for the experience !",1
4,"The food and drinks here are A-Mazing! Wow I have never had such great cooked food. I had the Smash tequila drink, the chicken tikka, and a garlic naan. The drink was so good it's like a mojito but with tequila and it was incredible. The chicken was so good and it was so perfectly cooked it tasted like butter. And the Naan they cooked perfectly there was not too much garlic and it was cooked where it wasn't too bready but still tasted awesome. The one downside is that it is pretty expensive. London overall is expensive but for a students budget it was a lot. It was £7.50 for the drink, £7.50 for the chicken, and £2.90 for the naan- so about 30 American dollars total. But will still come again!!!",1
5,Wow! Been to India 2 times this place is legit! Best Chai I've had outside of India. Drinks are fantastic food is better. If you like Indian food this USA must go!,1
5,"Oh! My! God! I have NEVER experienced the level of hospitality Dishoom provides. Bold hospitality coupled with AMAZING food is a game changer. I'd fly to London just to eat here if I could. There was a 40 minute wait and the host said this was a slow night, but trust me you should wait. The food is just amazing!",1
5,"We ate at Dishoom while on vacation in London (from the United States) and were so impressed with the food and the restaurant . Their tapas style was perfect for us as it allowed us to try multiple dishes. The decor was fun and the drinks were delicious. Best part, the bill at the end was extremely reasonable!",1
4,"Awesome !! It's very crowded so please reserve your table beforehand. We ordered berry chicken, kheema pao, fry okra apart from other things. For the price the quantity is very less. 
Overall ambience and experience is good but I was not too happy with the size of servings.",1
5,"OMG - want to go for awesome, fantastic, delicious Indian while in London? Don't be discouraged by the wait as it moves fairly fast. But you have to try this place - it is phenomenal. You have to try the Bollybellini drink (we had 2 each it was so good),  then ask your waiter for some suggestions especially if you're more into spicy (SUPER HOT) food or not. We had a blast and it is definitely worth going back again!",1
5,"Before I finally got to visit Dishoom, I always wondered ""what's the fuss about?""
I now understand aforementioned fuss.
I won't clutter you with a essay review as pretty much everything is already covered by previous reviews (they are spot on), so here's my lowdown:
GET THE BREAKFAST NA'AN. So simple, yet revolutionary and absolutely brilliant.
TRY THE COFFEE. It's no costa crap.
GET A SIDE OF MASALA BEANS. Better than Heinz Baked Beans - I never thought I'd say that, ever.
PREPARE TO WAIT. The secret it out, London and the rest of the UK now know about Dishoom so you may have a little wait, but by lord it's worth it!
I love it. Will be back on each visit to the capital!",1
3,"Just OK.  Nothing to rave about.  Not sure why people waiting in line for two hours for.  Flavor and spice level are tone down to 30% of regular Indian food.  Cheese chicken ruby is too oily on the sweet side, not sure why?  Daal is pretty good.  Naan is above average.  Samosa is good, Keema Pau not bad.  Spicy potato is good, spicy lamp chop too dry.  Biryani is good.  DONOT order lasi drinks, no flavor at all.  This place is more like Britainized Indian food.",-1
5,I love their breakfast as well as all day menu. I had the house chai and egg naan on this trip.,1
4,"I went to the Covent Garden after King's Cross, so it felt that the place was too small compared to the other one. (Especially with all the people who want to go here... lol) We waited for about an hour for dinner and the wait was worth it! You can see the naan being prepared and cooked in the kitchen and of course they were amazing. Personally love the garlic naan! The ruby chicken is my favorite!",1
5,"We came here for a quick lunch before an event in Covent Garden. Make sure to make a reservation, as this place is extremely popular! The ambiance is like stepping into an authentic Indian kitchen, with a view of chefs making naan and the scent of exotic spices wafting through the air. We started off our lunch with the flavorful Far Far (or as it's referred to in the menu, a ""carnival of snackery""). We also had the gunpowder potatoes, chicken tikka, and a chicken tikka roll, all of which were delicious!",1
5,"This place is really popular. I always see a huge line outside at night time. At least 1 hour wait. They only receive reservations for the day time and walk in only for the night time. I made a reservation for Sunday afternoon. At around 3:45, there's already a line outside. 
They give you three sauces to dip: spicy, sweet and herbal. They both taste good by themselves. I tried the keema pau. The minced lamb with peas and the toasted buns are good. They really go well together. The children ruby is the best. Usually I like the Indian chicken dishes because of the sauce and not the chicken. Here the chicken really absorbs the sauce and tastes a lot better than the sauce. I also ordered the garlic naan. Even though they say it's made by hand and baked to order, it's good but not the best I've had. The service is good and the waitress gave me good recommendations.",1
5,"I waited 2 hours in line on a Tuesday night to get into Dishoom for dinner, and I returned 14 hours later for breakfast. It was THAT good.
If you're in London, DO NOT MISS DISHOOM. You WILL regret it. To any critics of London's food scene, I say: go to Dishoom because you're wrong.
Lovely ambiance with marble tables and cute lighting, friendly servers, and an interesting mix of clientele. For dinner, my friend and I shared the okra fries, chicken ruby, Masala prawns, black house daal, garlic naan, and Roomala roti. Everything was EXCELLENT. We didn't manage to finish all of our food, but it was INCREDIBLE, and I was very sorry to leave food left over. 
We couldn't stop talking about it and had to return the next morning to try the legendary bacon naan roll. For breakfast, we split the bacon naan roll, sausage and egg naan roll, Bombay omelette, and we each ordered breakfast lassis. I actually liked the sausage and egg naan roll better than the bacon naan roll, but both were phenomenal and lived up to the hype. The Bombay omelette was average, but hey, there's not much you can do with an omelette. The breakfast lassis (yogurt, banana, and mango topped with oats) were AMAZING.
I don't know what I can say about Dishoom that hasn't already been said on Yelp. Hands down my best food experience in London (if not the entirety of my Eurotrip). Do it. Worth the wait.",1

5,"I love Indian food and know that London has some great Indiana restaurants, so I really wanted to indulge while visiting. My husband is not much of a fan, but he was willing to tag along. When we got to the restaurant, there was a line outside (in December--brrr) with an hour wait time quoted, and we decided to wait for a table (at least they serve tea and chai while you're waiting!). Well, the food was phenomenal and well worth freezing our tails off! My husband liked the food, so there's hope for him yet . However, if you are looking for a quiet place to dine, you will want to steer clear.",1
5,"Awesome place, plenty of vegetarian options which is nice. The staff are on point and friendly. The full breakfast is the jam, and the omelette looks fantastic. I'll be back for surr",1
5,"Indian comfort food at its best! We came around 4 and were seated right away. No lines! I ordered the Bollybellini, lamb samosas, prawn kaliwada, okra fries, the chicken ruby, and the garlic naan. The food was excellent and the service was swift and efficient. I looked forward to visiting this restaurant and they have exceeded my expectations. Well done!",1
5,"Oh ..... My ...... God! 
Forgive me Father in Heaven for I just said your name in vain but honestly it wasn't completely  because damnnnnnn that meal was heavenly!! 
*cherubims and harps enter the scene* 
Ok let me start with the fact that I have been meaning to come here for months but between sipping champagne and flying back & forth between here and Paris I just hadn't had the time.
However, yesterday that all changed baby! I was in the area from a light shopping spree when I had the craving for some serious asian persuasion... My morale compass knew what time it was and I made my way to Dishoom! 
I was seated in the courtyard which was lovely actually.. Cosy and pretty at the same time! 
I had a cold glass of champagne to begin with and then went on to have my meal.... Here's where I lose points people.... I can't remember what I had! Lol 
Well I can't recall the name... But it was sublime! Flavour town, flavour planet .... FLAVOUR EMPIRE!!!!!!soft,juicy,well marinated chicken something!!! I mean I'm seriously reconsidering moving to Asia just so I can bask in flavours like these all day everyday!!! 
I can recommend the garlic naan which was yummy and the chutneys that they gave me were alllllllll delicious! 
Ok look I could go on all day about this but I'd rather be eating more of the stuff so I'll leave you with this.... Go!! Just Bloody Go! And take me with!! ;)",1
5,"Absolutely spendid!  My family and I waited nearly an hour in the frigid weather but the food and service were worth the compromise.  In fact, while waiting outdoors, a staff member provided complimentary hot chai and mint tea for folks on top of turning on the patio heaters which made the wait bearable for everyone.  Once inside, the atmosphere was lively both street and lower levels.  Service was superb from soup-to-nuts as the friendly staff came prepared with a food-allergy (dairy and nut free) friendly menu to keeping our glasses constantly full.  We ordered a variety of items, including Chicken Ruby, Vegetable Samosa, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Garlic Naan; all of which were simply delicious.  The food was cooked and served at the right temperature, the curry was not overly powering, and the spices were hot yet very tasty.  Although entree portions were somewhat modest, we left the restaurant feeling very satisfied.  On our way out, we were further amazed to witness two large crowds waiting in the front of the restaurant despite the darkness and cold weather (one would think Dishoom was a popular nightclub).  No doubt add Dishoom to your list of restaurants to enjoy when in London's Covent Garden.",1
5,"Amazing Indian food, great atmosphere. The prices are also reasonable, especially by London standards",1
4,"I dragged my husband on the tube and up 6 blocks to stand in line in the rain and he wasn't feeling it. I told him the line would go fast. (Ha! I lied but hey, it was worth a shot.) They told us it would be 90 minutes. Doh! I stayed in the cold line and it was sprinkling at one point but I was not going to come all this way from SF to punk out now. They brought everyone in line a free sherry shot and it went by fast. 
55 minutes later we were seated and couldn't decide what to have so we ordered the ruby chicken, chicken tikka, butter bhutta, rice, garlic naan, and a lentil something. Omg. It was so worth the wait. I'm glad we braved the weather. Lots of Gluten free options available.",1
4,"I knew Dishoom was a must when my friend who lives in London said it was one of her favorites. We went to the one in Covent Garden, which wasn't far from our hotel. 
We got the garlic naan, fried okra fries, samosas, chicken tikka, lamb kabob, and chicken ruby. Everything was delicious. Yes, they come in smaller portions, but that's normal. My advice: Just order a lot and try it all. You won't walk away grumpy, I know that for sure.",1
5,"Absolutely delicious! All the Indian food suspects kicked up a notch for today's modern tastes. The only complaint that I had was that I didn't have enough room in my stomach to eat everything. It's the kind of place where even the basic side dishes warrant some praise (e.g., bowl of greens). 
The service was really good and I appreciated that they didn't overseat even though it's clearly a popular place to eat. I'm sure that helps with the service and food for that matter. 
Expect a wait. We first tried to go in the evening, but it would have taken at least 2 hours. I don't care how good the food is supposed to be, but 2 hours is just too long for me to stand outside in the freezing cold. Yes, I might have been able to get inside and wait for your table earlier at the bar, but that still would have been a long time before that happened. We ended up going to lunch instead the following day and there was a 30 minute wait, with a 15-minute wait outside. Much better!",1
5,"The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that there is going to be a 1.5-2 hour wait depending on what time you go, but it's well worth it! While waiting, the staff severs a chai tea to everyone in line that would like one. You stand in line for about an hour until you get through the door, but wait there's more! Once you step in you get a buzzer to hold on to, and they will notify you when your table is ready. This will take another 30-45 minutes. While waiting you can grab a drink at the bar and a snack. We started with the Dishoom IPA, a Bollybellini and Far Far. The beer was decent, Bollybellini was interesting and the Far Far was crispy, colorful and lemony. We were finally seated and excited to order. We looked to Yelp reviews for some assistance and already knew what we wanted by the time we were seated. We had the Prawn Koliwada, Chicken Tikka, Black Daal and Garlic Naan. The prawns were very flavorful with a tamarind chutney. Chicken Tikka was bomb, especially with the garlic naan. Black Daal was so rich and full of flavor and also great with the garlic naan. At night it is very low lit but very cool atmosphere. The server was helpful and very attentive and the bathrooms were quite interesting. I recommend this place to all my friends that visit London, I can't wait to go back and try other menu items!",1
5,"We were visiting London from San Francisco and made reservations here for lunch. We had a party of 4. One of my friends recommended to try Indian food in London. The service was great and the food was really good. Definitely make reservations we passed by the following day and there was a long line waiting to be seated. 
We ordered samosa vegetable/lamb, house chai, mango lasse, fried calamari, pumpkin dessert, chicken tikka, mahi tikka, ruby chicken, garlic naan and their lentils special. The lentils were a bit spicy for me. My favorite dishes were the ruby chicken and the mahi tikka. We would definitely come back on our next London visit.",1
5,"The food was absolutely amazing and worth the 30 minute wait. I was told during peak hours, it can get up to 2 hours. It is a great fusion mix of Indian and Iranian. The food is fresh and comes out quickly. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. If I had more time, I would go again and again. Would love to try their full menu!!!",1
5,"Loved getting a cup of chia while waiting on line. What a treat. Once inside we ordered a few appetizers: paneer, chaat, keema, and Bellini's. The food was delish and just the right portions.",1
5,The service is top notch. Our server Bruno could not have been nicer or more welcoming!! The food was extraordinary and the atmosphere and ambiance some of the best I've experienced.,1
4,It's a nice place a bit overrated for what it is but it does have good food and it does have a nice atmosphere,1
5,"Daal is to die for. Some of the best service I have ever had. All around, an incredible experience.",1
4,"Made a booking for Sunday brunch (a must-do, unless you want to wait in line forever), and really enjoyed it!  Our servers took a while to get our drink order and bring us water initially, but once that was sorted things moved very quickly, and they were extremely gracious when some members of our party wanted runnier eggs, replacing the dishes and taking them off the bill, which was almost too kind!
I got the akuri - lovely soft spiced scrambled eggs with some buttered buns and a grilled tomato.  This was a very simple dish, and a light breakfast, but the eggs were lovely with complex flavors.  If you're really hungry, get a side of some meat.  I got a side of some vanilla yogurt (you could see the vanilla bean flecks in it) with fresh fruit like grapes and mango and berries in it, which was just gorgeous and made a great side dish or brunch sharing plate.  Or just eat it yourself!  My husband loved his Big Bombay (like an Indian-spiced full English) and my sister-in-law said the bacon egg naan was perfect for a hangover.  It looked absolutely glorious so I'll have to get that next time.  In the end everyone thought their food was gorgeous - the only thing I could've wanted was quicker service initially, and less watery fresh orange juice (lots of ice cubes in the glass, felt like a bit of a rip off).  Also the buns that come with the eggs are quite plain - was hoping for something with a little more pizazz.  But all very minor complaints over the course of a generally terrific meal.
We also saw a server handing out mugs of chai to people waiting in line outside, so maybe DON'T make a reservation, haha!",1
3,"Ok, I randomly picked this place because it has high reviews on both Yelp and Trip Advisor. But a lot of Indian restaurants have high ratings in London - so it truly was a random pick.
This is why I was shocked that there was a line waiting out the door at 3 pm on a random Saturday!! 
It's all good though. We decided to wait and were seated within 30 minutes. Which was awesome. The staff was very friendly. I mean - VERY. I have nothing but positive things to say about the people working here.
However, service was a bit slow. We showed up during a shift change and we kinda got lost in the shuffle with our waitress. But that being said, we took a while eating (one of the people dining with us has a condition that requires her to eat slowly) during a very busy time and not once did we feel rushed.
But why 3 stars? Well - because honestly I truly don't understand the hype. Yes, the food was good - but it was nothing special beyond a regular Indian restaurant. I think there's a lot of hype about this place and I'm not really sure why. I hear they have an amazing breakfast and a few wonderful and unique dishes, so maybe that's what bumps the rating up to 4 or 5 stars?
To me, it was a bit noisy and there were a few very odd dishes on the menu that don't scream ""Indian"" to me. Fried okra? But I guess it's all about what you're into. Everything we had was ""A-OK."" Yes, I'd go back. But personally, I'd rather go someplace less touristy and less noisy.
Not good for groups. Not good for children. Not good for romantic dining (since you won't be able to hear your date over the loud 40's music). But a cool experience.
Oh, and prices are pretty reasonable - even with all the hype. Order the chai! 
Dishes we ordered:
Mahi-Mahi Tikka 
Chicken Briyani
Vegetable Curry
Black Dhaal
Naan
Vegetable Samosas",-1
4,Ridiculously long line to get in but the food and service were great. The drink selection was a tad sparse.,1
4,"Daal was phenomenal. Probably the best daal I have had. Food was heavy, but yet very good. I enjoyed my experience very much so.",1
4,"I came here for breakfast this morning as I was in between meetings since 8am! I was so hungry and I have always been a fan of Dishoom, so why not try their brekkie menu.
I ordered the big bombay and house chai. Woaaaaah talk about a big plate of food, a man beast portion to be exact! 4 rashers of streaky charred bacon, akuri - masala scrambled eggs, 2 shropshire pork sausages, masala baked beans, grilled mushroom, grilled tomato and buttered pau buns, and a side of ketchup in a small dish. I managed to eat majority of it, I loved the charred bacon - the slightly bbq, crisp in taste, the pork sausages were ok - nothing special. The akuri was my fave!!! So flavoursome, unique, the blends of spices mixed well and so yum with the buttered pau buns. 
Their bacon is soured from The Ginger Pig, and it's probably the best I have had!
The house chai is definitely bombay style, slight too sweet for my liking, nonetheless perfect for a monday morning. 
Also they don't take reservations for less than 4, so get there quickly to enjoy the vast array on their menu. if there is 6 or more, do book, they will tell you off if you don't!",1
5,"This is my favorite place to go in London - their prices are great and their food is absolutely amazing. I've tried a lot of different things, but I love their chicken tikka and their garlic naan. Also, their chocolate chai is to die for. Even though you can't get refills on the chocolate chai, if you order it BEFORE 5, you can get free refills of the regular chai, which is amazing. Every time my friends come to visit, I always bring them to Dishoom and they are without a doubt, extremely pleased and satisfied. There is typically a line, but I've found that if you go at around 11:45, there aren't a ton of people and you can just sit there until their lunch starts. Alternatively, my friends and I have gone at around 9:30, and we only have to wait around 40 min or so. I really, really love this restaurant and I would recommend visiting at least once in London!",1
5,"Actually don't think I've ever had better Indian food. Enjoyed everything that we ordered, which was a lot. Chicken Tikka was incredible and was served hot in a crock. Love the naan, but will definitely get the cheese naan also next time. 
You must go to this restaurant!!!!",1
1,We stood in line for one hour for this. Everyone told me you must go. Seriously some of the worst Indian food I've ever had. Lamb chops were burnt to a crisp. Roti and naan were dry. The chicken curry Ruby which is their specialty is tasteless. The lamb biryani wasn't even edible. They are famous for cocktails. The bolly Bellini is sugar syrup. I would give this zero stars if I could. Horrible!,-1
5,"As every other reviewer stated...this is THE place for Indian food in London. This Dishoom is just a short walk from Covent Garden so if you plan your day right you can eat here....arrive about 10:45 for lunch to get in line. There was a short line (midweek day) but they get you in & served @ a good clip. Also, even tho they are busy they don't make you feel rushed. As a light eater I opted for the Chicken Ruby, Garlic Naan & Salted Lassis. Perfect...although disappointing to not be with people to share a variety of all the fabulous choices. Wait staff is just attentive enough to not be annoying. You won't be disappointed!",1
4,"I don't normally like indian food as my experience has generally been a let down. 
Dishoom is the only exception i'll make as it has yummy mix of options, great for sharing.
Not that keen on the desserts though.",1
4,"This place was great. I could smell Indian smell in front of the door already. 
Nice people, reasonable price and yummy food. but some curries are very spicy.. my friend was almost panicked.. and they gave us free small fruity drinks because of it. :) was kinda funny.",1
4,Pretty good food.  My chicken being pink kinda threw me off.  But supposedly its supposed to look like that.,1
5,"A meeting in London took me wandering past Dishoom, and with their expansion to Manchester soon, I just had to try it. 
For a Thursday lunch time the place was incredibly busy - always a good sign - so I asked for a table for 1 and was luckily seated straight away. 
I ordered masala prawns with a naan bread as a light lunch and they were fantastic!! I would definitely try them again. 
The front of house staff were friendly and didn't make me feel isolated when dining alone.
I can't wait for Dishoom to come to Manchester now.",1
5,"We tried to make reservations and didn't get a call back until 24 hours later. At that point there were no more reservations, but we were told that if we came at 530, it would only be a 30 min wait. We decided to do this and cancel another reservation we had for ten people with 4 kids. We get to dishoom and there is a 2 hour wait! We found out that the reservation service is at a headquarters offsite and that they don't know the true wait times. We were frustrated because we had hungry kids and we cancelled a reservation and had no real food options. The manager Luna stepped in and bent over backwards to make it work for us. We really appreciate the service and would recommend this place to anyone. Additionally the food was really good! Highly recommended and no doubt a 5 star place",1
5,"This place is sooo good! And cheap! I would definitely recommend this place for Indian food. However, just note that the wait can be pretty long. Recommend the Black Daal (lentils) and chicken ruby.",1
5,"I dream about Dishoom and bee line for it for lunch or brunch when I land back home in London, a truly delicious British Indian restaurant with cool interior design and crazy low prices for the quality of food.
Normally I grab a bacon naan roll (it makes me so very happy that's a thing!) and go from there but it was lunch time so this time we started with the far far (spicy chips (described as a 'sort of festival of snackery' - sold!) and chilly cheese on toast followed by black daal, lamb kabob, chicken berry biriyani and roti - and then a mebsahibs mess - so a light lunch for two...
And waddled out not too much poorer but very much fuller two hours later. 
Delightful service from Leo throughout.
You can't book here and waits can be a while if you come at peak eating times - but come very late morning for an early lunch or mid afternoon for a late one and you'll stroll right in. 
It's a staple on my London home-eating circuit. And the hundreds of good reviews are entirely deserved. They also have locations in soho and shoreditch if Covent Garden tourist crowds make you want to die!",1
5,"What is there to say that hasn't been said hundreds of times? Best Indian food I've ever had at such affordable prices. Had spiced prawns for the first time which were perfectly cooked with a nice kick to them.
Only take reservations up to 5:45pm so if you're able to eat early, definitely do that to avoid the insane lines",1
4,"What I Ordered: Ruby Chicken, Grilled Paneer, Spicy Slaw, Garlic Naan and Cheese Naan
Flavor: Everything tasted very good.  Not the best Indian I've ever had but definitely up there. 
Service:  They take great care of you here. We were waiting in the cold outside in line to get in, and the hostess would serve us warm tea while we wait.  The wait time, while long, didn't take longer than they had estimated. The one annoying thing about the service is this one of those places where the server feels the need to ""explain the menu"" to you, which came off like a cheap sales pitch to get us to order pricey appetizers.
Atmosphere: Very trendy.  This ain't your mama's Indian restaurant.  Great decor inside.
Price: Very reasonable for the quality you get.
Location: Close to Covent Garden, so pretty convenient for tourists.
Other Comments:  This is NOT a traditional Indian restaurant with a traditional menu.  They really only have a couple meat curries on the menu and everything else is some sort of creation that has to be exclusive to Dishoom.  It's a nice change of pace if you want to try something new.",1
5,"This is THE Indian restaurant to go to in London!  It was well worth the wait (which can end up being one hour.  The restaurant was kind enough to offer free drinks for those waiting in line.  Service was all great.  Our waitress did try to sneak in a lot of extra charges, like ""oh this dish really needs naan or rice with it, which do you want? (without mentioning the extra fee), so be aware of that.
The food was fantastic.  The best Indian food I've tasted.  No wonder the place is so popular.  If you don't mind the wait, I'd really reccommend this popular place.  Probably better to go during an off hour though.
Prices are decent especially for the quality of food.",1
4,"Went here last night and yes it was that good. Despite the wait which was not that bad ( we were told a wait time of 50min. but it was 20 at least). Very good service. The fried okra, garlic nann and lamb Bryrani were very good. Definitely a good experience.",1
5,Better than expected. Will absolutely be back on my next visit to London. Hey Dishoom - come to Seattle please!!!!!! The people here only think we have good Indian. I thought so too. Until I had you. I had no idea what I was missing.,1
5,Best dal anywhere. Love the paneer tikka. Never disappoints! Wish they would come to NY!,1
5,"First meal in England and it was a great decision.
Food: We ordered the Mahi Tikka, Spicy Lamb Chop, and Chicken Ruby. Our sides were roomalti roti and some buttered naan. All 3 dishes were amazing. The lamb was cooked perfectly. The Mahi was flaky and juicy. The chicken ruby was creamy and hearty. All three dishes combined with the sides worked perfectly well.
Drinks: 1) Chai: One word. Bottomless. You can't go wrong with that. Even if it weren't unlimited, I would get a few. 2) Americano: Decent. Not the best but above average.
Service: Our waiter was great. He took the time to explain to us everything on the menu. He also kept convincing me to get more chai, which I'm not sure if that was a good or bad thing... It's good in my book!
I would definitely recommend coming back here!",1
5,"Worth the wait. We went on a Wednesday evening and waited 1.5 hours but we were able to spend the last hour at the bar having drinks and snacks. The cocktails were great, the food was amazing and less spicy than described, which for me was a pleasant surprise. Even the dessert was good!!",1
5,"Really fantastic Indian restaurant. Before I came to London, 3 different people told me that I absolutely had to go to Dishoom, even if I took none of their other recommendations. The first time, I tried to make reservations on my birthday (a Sunday night in November) for myself and two friends, but I found out that they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. So we prepared ourselves for the long wait and got in the queue around 5:30. The staff was handing out chai and mint tea for those waiting outside. We were outside for around 45 minutes before getting led to the bar downstairs, where we waited for another 20 minutes. After that, our waitress led us upstairs and we were finally seated in the warm, beautifully decorated dining area. I ordered a cup of the house chai right away (the samples really work), and my friends ordered mango lassis, which were refreshingly light compared to other ones I've had. We then ordered a bunch of different dishes to share between the three of us: Vegetable samosas, cheese naan (takes naan to the next level -- try it!!), paneer tikka, chicken ruby, mattar paneer, black dahl, and gunpowder potatoes. It really was some of the best Indian food I've ever had. I think the black dahl was my favorite dish because I love lentils and it tasted the most unique. I don't eat meat, but the curry that came with the chicken ruby was fantastic. The chutneys that are served with the samosas are really wonderful -- ask for extra to eat with your rice. 
The service here is very, very good -- we had 2 different waiters checking in on us but we never felt rushed or annoyed. When I came with a different friend a Monday night, she ordered the Chicken Tikka thinking that it came with curry, but it was just the meat by itself. She asked if it was possible to get Chicken Tikka Masala instead -- and in under a minute, they'd replaced her dish without any hesitation. Everything about Dishoom is wonderful, from the food to the staff to the decor. I've never heard about anyone having a negative experience here. Whether you're in London for months, weeks, or days, definitely put this restaurant on your list.",1
5,Traveling to London for a conference at the start of September I went to Dishoom. It was the best Indian food I have ever eaten in a restaurant. I had brought some clients ( a group of 6)  to have dinner and they were all flabbergasted with how good the food was. I have to say that everything that was on the menu was amazing. The service is phenomenal as was the manager helping us get a great table upstairs. It worth every penny you pay. MAKE SURE YOU MAKE RESERVATIONS IN ADVANCE IF YOU HAVE A GROUP otherwise you will be waiting for some time outside in the line up sipping on Chai. Thank god I made reservations 2 days previous to my dinner.,1
5,"I want to tell the owners of Dishoom to open a branch in NYC and I'll gladly run it for them! 
We've been here 5 times over the course of two years and love the authentic, Bombay street food-style small plates done just right.
5 star dishes on the menu:
-- Vegetarian (potato + peas filling) or the lamb kheema samosas - both are excellent and a safe bet.
-- Okra Fries: crispy, savory, yummy. I dream of them. 
-- Keema Pau - mince lamb meat served with traditional bread called Pau- a little oily, but also spicy - the husband swears by it.
-- Black House Daal: one of the best we've tried. Buttery and rich without being too overwhelmingly heavy to digest. (sample with white rice)
4 star dishes: 
--Pau Bhaji: potatoes, tomatoes and other veggies mashed beyond recognition in a red color mixture that is a little fiery, a little tangy. I swear by it.
-- Prawn Kolidwada: tiny prawns deep fried beyond recognition - what's not to love about pepper shrimp? 
3 star dishes:
-- Chicken ruby: the eponymous chicken tikka masala rechristened by Dishoom. A little too tomato-y for my liking, wasn't blown away by it. There are better dishes on this menu. 
Desert: I love the mango kulfi here, it's beautifully flavored with cardomom and not too sweet.
Service: Very friendly and efficient most of the times.
Decor: This is my favorite part. Modeled on the lines of mostly-defunct Irani cafes in Bombay, India, Dishoom stays true to spirit, elevating the retro-vibe to a more upscale level. Expect to see quirky ads and vintage Indian Bollywood posters that are a blast from the past for patrons like us. Nostalgia done right! Even the restroom wash basins are modeled from the ones in India back in the 60s and 70s.   
Tip: Get a reservation if you can. Otherwise expect to wait at least 25-30 minutes anytime of day or evening.",1
5,"Great food, great staff, great atmosphere. The portions are also larger than the server suggests so you can definitely order less than they say. I highly recommend the dal and any of the boxed street food items (like the street food bun appetizer - can't remember the name). The desserts are relatively average - go elsewhere for something stellar or just",1
5,"Breakfast at Dishoom is a must! Their naan rolls are the best way to start the day (I'm torn between bacon and egg vs. sausage and egg, so I tend to switch off between the two each time I visit). For lunch/dinner, their gunpowder potatoes shouldn't be missed, and their raita is phenomenal. Pro tip: skip the chai, make note that their biryani dishes are a bit dry, and be aware that the food is spicier than expected (although this doesn't negatively affect the palate). Great service, too. Let's just say there's a reason Dishoom is rated among the top Indian restaurants in London. :)",1
3,"I must say I was a bit disappointed...
On a Friday night, we waited for 50 minutes before being seated (around 10:30pm). They offered us chai tea during the wait and it wasn't raining, so that was OK. They have an efficient system where they can tell you exactly how much you've been waiting and are very respectful of the order in which you arrived, so it felt like a fair process. 
We ordered the dahl (house recommendation, £7), a chicken dish (£11) with rice (£2.50), and garlic and cheese naans (£3 each). The dishes were good, but quite spicy, despite being described as mild, and not out of this world - very similar to Indian restaurants in Paris, which are not considered as the best preserved international food in France. The naans were incredible though - we hesitated to order more at the end of our meal, and one week after I'm still longingly thinking about them. Nah, I'm not food-obsessed AT ALL (: 
Is it good? I guess, if you are more of a spice-lover than us. Is it worth queuing up for 1 hour? Don't think so.",-1
5,I was craving Indian food as soon as we got of the Eurostar train from Paris. Located very close to St. Martins Lane hotel. Food was very very good. Service was as well. They said a 30 minute wait but took about 5 minutes,1
5,"This is really good even if you haven't really had Indian food before. There's lots of options for everyone. There's vegetarian options, vegan and even Keto and dairy free options. Don't go during normal eating hours unless you want to wait in line for ever. If you go during non normal eating hours you will be seated quickly and get good service and probably have a better experience.",1
5,"OUTSTANDING!!! There is a line down the street for a reason.  Food, service, ambiance are all wonderful. Reasonable prices, would be a repeat guest if I lived in the U.K.",1
5,"Fantastic and worth the wait. Without a reservation, my party of 2 had to wait about 40 minutes in the queue .The hostess, security, and managerial staff were all very gracious, offering us warm chai as we waited. After about 30 minutes, we were able to go to the bar and wait for our table, which was ready with in minutes of us getting our cocktails (Viceroy old fashioned  and chaijito ). Then came the food: calamari, bowl of greens, lamb samosas, chicken tikka, and prawn curry. Ohmuhgerditssoogood. Savory, sweet and with lots of heat. Everything was delicious, including dessert (the decadent chocolate pudding is a must have). 
TLDR: Nomnomnom. Eat all the delicious things.",1
3,"The breakfast was definitely an interesting take on my morning meal.  I have friends who adore Dishoom and it was decent, but not something I am dying to do again in London when there are so many other places to dine.  If you're looking for something quick, this is definitely not the place.  We had trouble keeping the attention of the server and getting more food and tea.  The chai is very nice and the bacon roll was good, but overall I wasn't over the moon about the whole experience.",-1
3,"After hearing so much about this place I finally checked it out. Overall I felt that this place was just average and didn't really live up to the hype. There were definitely positives and negatives and because I have such mixed feelings it will be easier to just list the pros and cons. 
Positives:
- Like the decor and atmosphere (they were playing nice 1920s music which gave it that speak easy feel)
- Friendly staff 
-  Chilli cheese toast - really good
- Lamb Biriyani - tasty, tender and well cooked lamb
Negatives:
- Tables were very close together (like they were trying to cram in as many people in there as they could)
- Chicken Tikka roll - really salty chicken and very odd flavours (super sweet, then a spicy kick, too overpowering taste of ginger), just really didn't taste nice (especially the chicken)
- The ""raita"" (this was just all wrong, no cumin, it had onions and tomatoes and lacked flavour big time), it was like a salsa that someone added yoghurt to, it was also such a huge portion (like a bowl full) 
- ordering process (we ordered the starters and only took the mains order while we were partway through eating the mains - a bit odd)
- Lack of choice (only 2 curry options - chicken or paneer and not many starters)
- You can't book a table for dinner (from 5:45) for less than 6 people 
So to summarise, would I come here again? Maybe (I would like to try the curry) but I'm not in any rush. Is it worth it to come here when you see massive queues outside? Hell no! (On principal, I never queue for restaurants anyway, but the food is definitely not worth queuing for).",-1
5,"Best Indian Food Ive ever had! I had heard about this place from one of my patients who recommended it and we coincidentally ran into it while walking around convent garden. We saw a line outside and said lets give it a shot. So happy we did! While we waited outside they gave us Chai Tea or Mint tea while we impatiently waited. When we finally got inside we waited by the bar and ordered a couple of cocktails that were really good. They specialize in Bombay Gin and they re cocktails define fly live up to the name. For lunch we ordered the Chicken , the lamb, the peneer mango salad and the yogurt sauce. Melt in your mouth deliciousness. I wish this restaurant existed in NYC. I would definitely come back when I visit London again .",1
5,"I can't comment on the rest of their menu but their brunch menu is amazing! I have been twice now and still can't get enough. 
First things first, the chocolate chai is to die for. The bacon naan is also simple but delicious, and the pao buns are warm and fluffy. And definitely get a side of masala beans with any dish you get which ties everything up nicely. 
The only downfall is the long queue, but if you make a booking (and you need to make those well in advance if you want a spot), you will breeze through and have your day made with some good food.",1
5,"Everytime I go to London I try and stop by here for breakfast or dinner .. outstanding food, fab service and a great atmosphere 
Gunpowder potatoes - love love love",1
5,Great restaurant with innovative Indian dishes with a throw back to Old Bombay,1
4,"My friend and I waited about an hour to eat here. About one hour outside and 10 minutes inside. I think if it weren't for the cold, the wait wouldn't have been too bad. We had access to wifi and they served us some hot tea as well. 
Once we were finally inside, a host came to seat ppl. I was a bit put off bc when it was our turn, he went to each party, skipping over me and my friend, asking if we were the next number. Fortunately, I overheard him and said that we were that number. 
We ordered the chicken ruby, black daal, Mattar Paneer and garlic naan. I loved the chicken ruby and my friend loved the paneer. We both could have done without the black daal. 
Not sure I'd wait an hour again but enjoyed our food. 
Price wasn't so bad",1
5,Excellent Indian Fusion. Off the chart. Exceeded every expectation. Great staff. Friendly service. Awesome atmosphere and music.,1
4,I was disappointed - it didn't live up to the hype.  And it was pricier than I expected too. The black daal was very good.  The ruby chicken 3 stars.  It was tasty but I expected more. A small bowl of rice and plain nan were £2.90 each. I like doughy nan - this was crispy.  Maybe I'm just used to the cheap great tasting Indian food in Boston but this restaurant didn't live up to the high hype.  It is a good choice but not a crazy out of this world restaurant which many seem to indicate.  It's my first Indian restaurant in London in 20 years so I have to try a few more. If you come after 2 pm and before the dinner hour there should be no wait. They did tell me a 40 min wait but it was 5 min before we could go to the bar and another 10 or so minutes before I went to my table.,1
5,"Worth the wait! Food is delicious. We had the dal, gunpowder potatoes and paneer tikka. So good!
By the way, they do take reservations.",1
5,"This place definitely knows how to make people wait. My friend and I got there around 6 (which we thought was pretty early) and there was already an hour queue. The thing is, you have to stay in the queue the whole time instead of just leaving your number and coming back. To make the wait better, we were given chai and some dessert liquor. After about 40 minutes, we were taken into the bar and finished waiting there. It honestly didnt feel as long as it was rather it just felt like part of the experience.
The inside is simply but well decorated. The staff is very friendly and helpful about explaining the food and how the restaurant works. My friend is indian and so she ordered for both of us. The food came pretty quickly and everything we ordered was delicious. The chicken biryani was probably the best Ive ever had and went perfect with the daal. 
Overall a fabulous meal. The restaurant does not disappoint and I get the hype around it. Highly recommend but pro tip is to head there around an hour and a half before you want to eat.",1
5,"A long overdue review. We had their daal, which is spicy lentil stew, and chicken ruby. We also had naan, which was deliciously burnt and buttery. Take me back to London please. Britain's food is notoriously well known for being foul, but their Indian is spot-on. No, the food is NOT authentically Indian. It is very fusiony. However, that doesn't mean it's not mind-bogglingly delicious. A spot that you HAVE to try if you're ever in town.",1
4,"Visited Dishoom in its very centrally placed location before a matinee performance of Miss Saigon. 
We ordered the Chicken Ruby, Pau Bhaji, House Black Daal, Roomali Roti, Basmati Rice, Garlic Naan and Matter Paneer. It was, as you might suspect, a lot for a party of three. But everything was wonderful, so other than portion control I really had no issue with our very large order. 
I especially liked the Matter Paneer! I'm not usually one for vegetarian dishes, but the sauce was rich and flavourful which fit my palate perfectly. The Pau Bhaji was good, but I don't really enjoy having fried bread as a ""bread"" so perhaps if you share my preferences, you could skip that.
Service here was excellent! Our server checked in with us every once in a while, ensuring that we never ran out of water etc. 
My only gripe would be that it was a little pricey. One garlic naan is 2.50 and when that's converted to SGD, that's around 5 dollars! One naan in Singapore is probably half that price at worst. Oh well!
All in all, great food, great service but not so great prices.",1
4,"I've heard from many people that London has fantastic Indian food, so what better place to start than the most reviewed place on Yelp?
Dishoom has a wait that exceeds one hour for most of the day during peak meal times - be prepared for this by either making reservations or being willing to wait. They are definitely prepped for the amount of people they get each day, though! If you come for dinner, they'll have hot tea for you while you wait in line. Around twenty minutes into the line, they'll take you inside to the bar area where you can order drinks and appetizers while you wait for a table to clear up. Once you have a table, you can go and order all of the food that you want.
I'm a huge fan of their ruby chicken, garlic naan, and Dishoom chicken tikka. Also, the potatoes that they serve are fantastic. I ordered a drink at the bar - it was a chai-infused apple cider, but it was a bit of a miss for me (and a little on the pricey side £6.50 a bottle).
Overall, come here if you want some great Indian food in the heart of London - if you can deal with the wait, it'll definitely be worth your while!",1
5,"It's pretty much all been said already.  Absolutely outstanding indian food, with an awesome variety of flavors, spices.  I've been here 3 times, tried more than 15 different things, and absolutely loved all of them.
This place also knocks it out of the park on service.  On the weekends, there's a big ole line.  However, they brought us tea and other refreshments in the line.  Very nice of them!  When you get down to the bar to wait for a table, the servers all already know your name and are quite friendly.  Bar drinks are good.
So all in all:
Food - 5/5
Service - 5/5
Great atmosphere - 5/5
My favorite restaurant in London, and my favorite indian restaurant in the world!",1
5,Delicious and not too pricy! Waiting time for a table is a bit of a drag but it's definitely worth it!,1
4,"The food was pretty good, but in all honesty, I've had better Indian. I thought the complementary chai tea while you stood in line was an expert touch, but otherwise, the food was not all that it is hyped up to be. The chicken ruby was a little too sweet. The lamb was delicious. The Dahl was good but the naan was a little too crispy. The lamb samosas were my favorite dish of the evening, but you only get 3 of them...lame. The place was super busy, so I didn't feel like we got a super friendly/helpful waiter. Overall, I would eat here again, but only if I didn't have to wait in line for an hour. I'm sure there better places in London for Indian that don't have such a wait.",1
5,"London is known for Indian food, and this place was awesome.  We have great food here in the Bay Area, so I was not sure that this would be that special.  There are lines in front of this place all the time.  We had to wait an hour going early on a week day!  My son lives above this place so I saw the crowds all the time.  Everything we had was good.  We ordered based on others recommendations here.  If you have the time and like Indian this is a great place.  There is really a fun atmosphere there, and they serve you chai tea while in line, and give snacks to the kids!",1
5,"I get to travel the world for work. I always look forward to finding the restaurants that are unique to the city I'm visiting. Dishoom was great. I currently live in Texas, but I'm from California and of Indian decent. The food and drinks tasted perfect. I loved it and will be back.",1
4,"Queue was a little long when arrived, told it was an hour and 20 min, but felt much shorter.   They have a great system... free sherry/vermouth/lemonade while waiting in line...   after about 15/20 min you get a place in the bar.... 20/30 min later we were seated.     Food was reasonably priced...   always want to order everything when I go for Indian food.   We had Veg Samosa, Okra Fries - as recommended by the sexy Irish bartender, entrees: chicken ruby and chicken tikka, black dal, basmati rice and garlic naan.  Chicken ruby and black dal definitely must orders!",1
4,"Cool Indian restaurant in the city center! Go on Sunday night to avoid waiting in line for ages. We arrived at 9 PM and it took the team only 5 min to get us a table. Dinner was great, my friend just said she liked cocktails without alcohol better than cocktails with alcohol. But that was her only remark. Apart from that food was perfect.",1
5,"My husband and I had a great experience at Dishoom-Covent Garden. In fact, we dined there three times during our one-week stay in London because we enjoyed it so much. 
Everything that we had (Chicken tikka, lamb, samosa, calamari, etc.) was delicious. I cannot have dairy and it was wonderful that there was a dairy-free menu. For items that were prepared to be dairy free (i.e., no butter used), I appreciated that there were ""allergy"" markers on the food. I can't tell you what a relief it was to eat a meal at a restaurant without being terrified that I would have a reaction.  
On each of our 3 visits, everyone we encountered, from the people at the door, to the hostess, to the bartenders, to the wait staff, was friendly and helpful.
As others have warned, it does get busy. If you make it there before 5:30pm, there isn't much of a wait.  After that, expect to wait.  One night, we got there about an hour before they closed, and we still had to wait 30 minutes.  I was told that during their busiest time, you can expect to wait at least 2 hours.  It is worth the wait though.",1
5,"This is by far my favorite restaurant in London!! Great prices. Great food. Fast and exceptional service. I live in Los Angeles and just wish they would expand to the US. I dream about going back to London just to eat at Dishoom again cause there is nothing like it. 
I've been to Dishoom 3-4 times. For both breakfast and lunch. The breakfast is amazing with the limitless chai (although not sure this limitless applies to all locations). My favorite is the fruit and yoghurt. Which I don't know how they make their yogurt and have attempted to recreate. (I even bought a yogurt maker to make it and also googled various recipes to try - all to no avail). Their yogurt has the just right amount of sweetness to it with the honey and vanilla. With the fruit I could eat this everyday. The naan rolls (sausage and bacon) are amazing as well. I love the tomato jam in the rolls, that I asked the waiter if they sold the jam and sadly they do not but if they did, I would buy it. 
For lunch I agree with the other reviews. Bombay Colada. WOW and WOW. Again tried to re-create this drink at home to no avail. Just amazing. I could drink like 10 of these. Also agree the black house daal is one of a kind. Very flavorful. At Shoreditch I got the Lamb Raan Bun which was like a lamb pull apart sandwich. Exceptional. 
Overall Dishoom is just amazing. I think an exceptional restaurant is food taken to another level which makes it unique from others and to their own. Also to the point that you can't just go home and recreate it. You have to go there in order to eat it. Dishoom is both. Their food is unlike other Indian restaurants you have tried and in attempts to recreate it, I've tried and failed. I wish they would release a cookbook as I would be the first to buy it!!",1
5,"We loved this place! We came here for lunch with our 8 month old baby and everyone was super nice, accommodating and attentive! Food was amazing and my hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed our food! 
Would come back when we return to London again!",1
5,"Long overdue review from November but... AAH! They don't mess with Indian food in London!! And when they say the English have the queue down pat they aren't kidding! We arrived to a line and had a lovely conversation with the hostess at the door. We were led inside and invited to wait at the bar, which was nice cause it was quite cold outside. We were seated shortly after!
We ordered a good lot -- calamari, black daal, garlic naan, and another dish I can't quite remember. It was all so delicious and the environment so classy! The only gripe was that it was so loud I couldn't hear my girlfriend but this was definitely tops on our trip!!",1
4,"When in London it goes without saying that having Indian food is de rigeur. I found Dishoom on Yelp and it is centrally located near Covent Gardens. 
The idea is a Bombay Cafe. The curries are good and flavourful and spicy. Kingfisher beer and good chai make for a very authentic and delicious meal",1
5,Great food.  Probably the best Indian food I have ever had.  Very small and the wait can be long but definitely worth it.,1
5,"OMG. This place is unbelievable! We went twice for lunch and even though it was packed we were able to get seats right away (at night is probably a very different story). Both of our servers were fabulous and the food was so flavorful. I want to go back to London just for this place! Some of our favorite dishes were the okra fries, the garlic naan, and the black daal. Great cocktails as well. I loved the Bombay Pimm's. You must try this place!",1
5,"What just happened. Wow!
Service
I was blown away is what happened. I came in around 12:30pm and was seated right away. Greeted at the table, they explained the menu to me and were super helpful. 
As I was dining, I was asked by 4 separate waiters for a total of 6 times if everything was alright. They gave me 4 chai refills (server name was: Moali and the manager was Sarune). Suffice to say, the service was impeccable. I'd go back for the service alone, but getting on to the food....
Food
As a traveler, dining alone is hard. Especially at an Indian or Chinese restaurant where everything is intended to be shared... Or for people like me who just wants to eat everything! I could just sample a small portion of the menu, and I had the calamari as an appetizer and balsamic rice + prawn curry. 
The calamari was deep fried and very sweet. I was instantly addicted despite knowing how bad it was for me. Superb. 
The House Chai was also amazing. I had studied abroad in India and this is the closest I've had to authentic Chai. Not too much sugar, milk and just perfect all around. 
Pro tip: there's unlimited refills until 5pm. 
The prawn curry was the house special and came with generous portions of gigantic shrimps. The curry was rich and flavorful... I could and did drink much of it by itself. 
And the balsamic rice... Spectacular. I don't normally comment on rice, perhaps desensitized as I eat it daily. There's something special about the long grain cooked with coconut milk. 
Lastly my meal was completely free. On Mondays, at the end of your meal, you'll roll a dice and have a gamble with fate. If you get a 6, your meal is on the house! I had no idea this was the case and thank my travelers luck to be here on a Monday!",1
5,"There aren't many times when you wake-up (in London), stretch, call your local friend about where to go for breakfast and they say - ""How about this Indian joint?""
Huh?
Yeah, my thoughts exactly! I'm all for Lamb Vindaloo kicked up to to a level 10 on the Indian spice scale or a Naan dredged in Butter chicken sauce so deep that you can't tell where the BC begins and the Naan ends! But before 11am? I danno guys...
And then there was Dishoom, Sweet merciful gods of Indian cuisine, what the WHAT!
So basically, the geniuses in the kitchen here have taken traditional english breakfast faves, slapped it upside the bread with some Indian spice, and boom - everything is nice. End of story. I didn't think this would be possible, call me a doubting Thomas, but I needed proof, and safe to say I got some.
To begin, I opted out of my normal breakfast coffee for a House Chai (or 4) @ £2.50, I was gulping this stuff by the gallon and better than tea, better than coffee, better than freshly squeezed OJ, this made my stomach oh so happy and calm after a few days of adjusting to British fare and a long flight.
Following my chai time, I didn't give my stomach too much of a break and went with the Kejriwal which is two fried eggs on chilli cheese toast. As described in the menu as ""A favourite of the well-to-do Willingdon Club, the first such Bombay institution to admit natives; the dish is reputedly named for the member who kept asking for it. (Not to be confused with Arvind Kejriwal, leader of India's Aam Aadmi - common man's - political party.)"" - £4.90
History lesson aside, this was a beautifully flavourful meal, part normal breakfast that I'm used to and part ""kick-it up a notch, Indian HELLO"" (waves excitedly).
I was so impressed, and breakfast is a hard meal to impress me with - rest assured I'll be back when I'm in the UK again! 
Pro-tip: The Breakkie/Brunch crowd starts to queue up around 10/10:30am so make a reso or get there early
Eatcrest Out!",1
5,"Brunch is AMAZING. Love dinner. The only downside is waiting in line, but it's worth it.",1
5,Eat here all the time.  Breakfast is delicious with naan egg sandwiches.  Dinner always good. Go to any location in London,1
5,Best vada pav ever - coming from a Mumbaikar! Food was amazing - loved the house black dal. The staff are very friendly and helpful.,1
5,"Food was amazing! Everything we ordered! I will say that it is true Indian style. The flavors are intense and rich in culture. Some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. We waited an hour to get in, but it was worth it. The Curry Chicken and Black bean soups are stellar.",1
4,"I came here on my own once since everyone was raving about the food. The food wasn't amazing but it was pretty good. However, I'm giving this place a higher rating because the service was exceptional and I was really impressed with my server. I wish I remembered her name! Overall this is a decent spot for Indian food",1
4,"Ahh Dishoom, you've come here based on your friend's recs and all the countless top ten lists you've read. You're wondering if it's worth the wait and to be honest, I don't think so. That's not to say it's not a tasty place with a fun ambience but I never go here unless guests are in town who request it, or if I so happen to be in the neighbourhood with time to kill. 
It's a fairly well oiled machine of the queue line w drinks while you wait, to the drinks bar area, to finally being sat and served. Menu changes with some frequency but I would suggest, if available the 
Chili Cheese Toast - exactly like it sounds, solid entree choice
Chicken Tikka - a 'classic' dish for the less ambitious and whitewashed, but still yummy 
Lamb Raan Bun (except without the bread) - like a shredded lamb on the bone, this was by far the star. So flavorful and filling.
Blach House Daal (lentils) - It's slight more refined spaghetti-o sauce with lentils. I wouldn't order it
Garlic Naan - yum, always yum",1
5,This is the best Indian food and drink we have ever had in the entire world. Their Spotify playlists featuring vintage Indian music is a fun way to relive the magic. Our server was spectacular at suggesting dishes.,1
5,"The best dining experience I had in London, hands down. The food was incredible, not just your typical Indian food. It was sort of like tapas style, but somewhat bigger portions. Also, the service was on point throughout the meal and that's saying something for this city.",1
5,"We had a wonderful late lunch at Dishoom!  They went above and beyond to accommodate our food allergies (dairy, tree nuts and sesame).  Prior to arriving, the manager communicated our allergies to the chef.  The chef specially prepared food in a separate area to avoid any cross contamination.  The server went over the menu with us letting us know which items would be best suitable to our needs and took all the precautions necessary.  Our food arrived with allergy sticks as well.  Our children really enjoyed the food.  Thank you Dishoom for your efforts to make this a stress free experience for our family.  We will be back again!",1
5,"Absolutely the best meal I have ever had. We had the vegetable samosas, chicken ruby, garlic naan, and the house black daal. I first thought it was the best Indian I have ever had, but actually it was just the best meal I have ever had. 
The staff was all friendly. The chaihito was fantastic. Our waiter was so sweet even though he was so busy. If we are ever back in London, this is my first stop.",1
5,"All around fantastic place. Love this location in Covent Garden, so it's busy, but totally worth it. 
The food is flavorful and authentic - you must try the pav baji, it is delicious. I order it every time I dine here. The ambiance of the restaurant is also a plus! Definitely one of my favorite Indian restaurants in London! Do yourself a favor and try this place, you will not be disappointed.",1
5,"This was a highly recommended to us and this place did not disappoint!
Be prepared to wait in line for 30-45 minutes as it is a very popular spot. They do offer a small drink while you wait outside and once you're inside they take you downstairs where the bar is located where you can order a cocktail or two while waiting for a few more minutes for your table. 
Food plates are enough to share with 1-2 more people or if you're not sure just ask the server. The Chicken Rubi was our favorite and for dessert I loove the Memsahib's Mess pudding which is strawberries and crumbled meringue in whipped cream - so light and hits the right spot to finish off the delicious meal.",1
5,"I didn't realize Indian food could taste this good in a while (I'm Indian!). We ordered Mutter Paneer, Dal and Chole Bhatura. All tasted excellent and service was good. Only negatives are 1) wait time of 50mins and 2) portion size is small (therefore had to order 3rd dish for 2 folks!). Anyway, check it out.",1
1,"After looking at the yelp reviews, went there on my second day in London.  There was a line outside and was told a wait of 1 1/2 hrs.  Hmmm,  decided nothing can be worth that wait,  walked around covent Garden and had pretty good food at 'punjab' restaurant.  
A few days pass and I was walking around the area, saw the line wasn't too big,  decided to take the leap. It was a looong wait, an hour in the cold outside. Finally I was shown in and directed to the bar in the basement cos my table was apparently still not ready. It was a little surprising as I was walking by a bunch of empty tables. The bar area was mostly empty,  it could easily absorb almost everyone standing in the line outside in the cold..  But hey,  that's not my worry..  As I am inside now and it is warm..  Nice. 
Finally I am shown to the table that was empty all the time I was standing at the bar. The menu is unique by basically having a few different choices but mostly just renaming most of the usual Indian restaurant food. By this time I am just excited to be sitting at my table and I go ahead and order the usual chicken and paneer dishes. And now I wait... Well actually, the wait was not long..  Surprisingly it just took them two mins to bring my food..  Part of me was very excited till I started to taste cold chicken tikka, cold romali roti and chicken Ruby which was just a bland tasting butter chicken with dry boneless chicken pieces ... 
Suggestions -  don't make people wait for hours in the cold to make the demand appear to be above capacity. Try and make food at order so it gets to the table not cold like it was waiting to be picked up ten mins ago. 
Overall - like I said earlier,  most of the time, no food Is worth an hour waiting in line, freezing London cold or not. If you are one of those folks reading reviews standing in that line, Take this advice - Go walk over to Talli Joe, a 5 mins walk to Soho and enjoy better food and amazing cocktails.",-1
5,"The ratings for Dishoom are legit as this is probably some of the best modern take on indian food I've ever had.   The only problem about this place is that the wait was pretty horrendous as you have to line up outside, and once you are actually in, the tell you to wait downstairs at the bar for your pager to go off.  Not a problem since the food was worth it.  At least while waiting outside, a waitress served us hot mint water to help us bare the cold weather.   
Here's what we had:
Black House Daal:  This is a very tasty dish if you like beans (if you don't, stay away).  I believe they used lentil in this one.  The flavor is kind of similar to Tikka masala with the starchiness of the slow cooked beans.  This dish is definitely very filling. 
Pau Bhaji: Tasty vegetable mash.  I wouldn't say this is a must order but it was definitely solid.   
Prawn Koliwada: I like they way the spicyness and flavor are really exploding in your mouth.  This were some tasty prawns.  The prawns were small though...
Spicy Lamb Chops: This dish was good as well but not a must order.  I wish it would have had more of a sear on it, but the flavors were there.
Chicken Ruby: Probably my favorite dish of the night.  The chicken is cooked in a makhani sauce, which is basically Tikka masala with more emphasis on a tomato-cream base.  Mouth watering deliciousness here.
Lamb Boti Kabob: These were good and had a nice marinade of chilli and ginger.
Garlic Naan: This was good, but you'll probably want to put in 2 orders, unless you ordered as much food as I did for 2 people.  
Don't miss this place as the flavors here are quite different than what you can find in the States.  
5 stars.",1
2,"Honestly can't see what the fuss is about. Guess it found its niche. Food bland, not enough spices.. Maybe they are not going for my palate. Massive queues and overrated.",-1
4,"Very BUSY, had a 45 min wait 30 if which was in a line outside.. a bit pricy for Indian fare in London, unique small plates very different than most menus, shareable. NOT a drinking establishment - mixed drinks were unimpressive and beer is by the bottle only. Steer clear of the Gola kala Khata! Tastes like umeboshi",1
5,"Dishoom puts all the Indian restaurants in NY to shame.  By this point I've probably tried just about every item on their food menu and there hasn't been a single disappointing dish.  
The restaurant is trendy so it attracts some out of towners, but it's also very much a local's spot for good eats.  I could recommend some dishes but then you'd just be reading a poor iteration of their menu which you can just as easily look up online :).  
Prices are lovely, service is consistently great and food is phenomenal.  Will probably be back in a few days if I'm honest with myself.",1
5,"Simply one of the best restaurants I've been to in the entire world.
Lines can be very long at peak times, but free hot chai is served in line and you usually seem to get in a little faster than estimated. Once you're inside the atmosphere is charming and the decor is highly polished while still feeling casual.
The food is superb. Be sure to try a grill and the Pav Bhaji. Be careful ordering spicy items if you can't handle spicy as they are truly hot, which is a good thing!
Prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food, although the dishes are not especially large. 2 dishes per person seems to work well.",1
5,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. I am not exaggerating. If anyone ever asks me what my favorite restaurant is, this is it. The only acceptable answer. 
I ate here in May to celebrate a birthday. It was raining, as it so often is in London, but the long line seemed to pass by quickly as we were served different kinds of chai while we waited to be seated. Once inside, the wait at the bar was wonderful and filled with samosas and red wine. 
I had the mattar paneer, black dhal, cheese naan, and chocolate chai. Every single thing was absolutely amazing, especially the black dhal. Dhal is served everywhere, but I have never had dhal like this, it's warm and comforting and exiting all in one and amazing with cheese naan. The chocolate chai is incredible, it's like a spiced hot chocolate tea, and I loved it. 
I loved Dishoom so much that I went for breakfast later that week at their location in Shoreditch, which was also amazing. Highly recommend the masala beans there. I LOVE DISHOOM. I wish there was a word to better express the extent of the deliciousness.",1
5,"Tikka Masala Heaven!! Being from NYC, we always think that we have the best of everything but Dishoom proved this to not be the case. This was the best Indian food I've ever had in my entire life. The line is long and be prepared to wait for at least an hour, but it's totally worth it. While in line, the staff will offer you some chai so that was very nice and enjoyable. I'd like to list up some dishes that we ordered that were amazing but truthfully, the entire menu is on point.",1
5,I recommend this place to anyone the staff are so helpful I look forward to going again it caters for your tastes when the weekend comes,1
4,"Great street food concept.  Food was good, and the place filled up fast around noon.  What I didnt enjoy so much was the chicken roomali roti, thought was too sweet.  The samosas and chole bature were good but the chole could have been a bit more robust/spicy.",1
4,"I was in London just for a few days and had to scratch my itch for some good Indian food.  Last night's attempt was a bust, and the long line outside of Dishoom seemed to be a promising sign (I would have gone here last night but the wait was an hour and 20 minutes).
Ordered the Chicken Ruby, rice, and naan.  It hit a bullseye.  Yum.
If you want to avoid the long lines come early, say around 5:30.",1
5,"Back tracking favorite meals in London. Made a reservation for Dishoom after hearing so many great things! Large table of 8 seated right as we got there (without a reservation, it's at least an hour and a half wait as there are always long queues!), I had a great time with good service. The chicken biryani and chicken ruby were delicious! I finished the meal with their mango kulfi! Yum!",1
4,Good fusion of foods. A pricey given the type of foods served. Ambience is great.,1
5,"Best meal of my life. My heart and belly are content. Visiting from NYC and would gladly have it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.",1
4,"Came here for breakfast and had a great time. The decor of the place is great and has a unique mix of old school dining mixed in with new elements. We had one of the egg dishes, bacon naan and the masala beans. The egg dish was unique, hearty and cheap. Adding the masala beans as a side was a good decision and it paired well. The bacon naan was good but it didn't wow me as the other two dishes. We also got their house chai tea and cappuccino. I received a refill of the team but wasn't charged for it. Not sure if they offer free refills or if this was an exception. 
Truly a unique dining experience and I'm hopeful someone will open a similar restaurant in New York. Breakfast was well priced and I wish we could have returned for another meal while we were in London.",1
4,"Food was good but I would not have been happy if I had waited in the legendary queues. I have spoken with people who've waited for an hour and 45 mins. 
Stand out food is black dhal, chicken curry and okra fries. 
We recommend booking for a lunch meal, no need to queue.",1
5,"Excellent food, the breakfast is particularly interesting. Try the naan with eggs. The house chai is their ""specialty"" but the cappuccino is also great. Can't go wrong here other than the long wait if you don't have a reservation!",1
4,"This was my first time trying restaurant style Indian food, instead of takeout or fast-food , and I left the place on an good note , the wait was long, but the food was definitely worth it. They serve the food in plates meant to be shared with groups, one thing that annoyed me is that the rice and naans did not come with the plates you had to pay for them.",1
5,"Unbelievable!!!  Gunpowder potatoes are incredible treat,  get two orders cause your going to want more.  The lamb shank (can't remember the official name) is so succulent, must have.
Service was also incredible,  I saw some reviews with complaints about service we had no problems.  Our waitress was fun and outgoing.  
You will wait in line,  we waited 1.5 hours but it was so worth it.  If you have the time available it is so worth the wait.  Just get some drinks and Somoza's from the bar.",1
4,Delicious Indian food! First time here for brunch - ordered the omelette and naan! Both were fantastic. The naan bread is super soft and flavorful. Recommend this place for all meals of the day!,1
4,"It's very good but not sure if it's mind blowing and worth waiting in a long queue. I ate here for an early lunch which was fairly easy but during the evenings I saw quite a line. The dishes are more subtle and don't leave you feeling heavy, which is really nice but I wouldn't say that I thought the food was any better than the affordable, non-hole-in-the-wall Indian restaurants in most major cities. Worth a try but not worth a wait.",1
5,"Absolute best meal I had while visiting London. I also visited the Carnaby location but this one was better.  Crispy shrimp appetizer was much better here. Highly recommend the black dal and ruby chicken (pretty much a murgh makhani). Great service. Go early to avoid the line/queue.  Small underground bar. Order a classic old fashioned not the one they have on the menu. 
I forgot to add save space for the chocolate pudding with chili ice cream. The best desert I had in London as well.  Basically the best lava cake you've ever had with mild chili ice cream. Perfection.",1
5,"The line outside is definitely a deterrent but it's also a testament to how amazing this restaurant is. The chai to customers waiting outside was such a lovely added touch. The manager frequently visited our table asking if we're okay and when we ordered more foo she communicated with our server seamlessly. The staff was very friendly and made great recommendations for food. The food itself was excellent, we ordered five dishes and enjoyed all five. Must try.",1
5,"Excellent , worth the 1 hour wait . We absolutely enjoyed this recommendation . The server Ali was excellent , knowledgable of the menu nice and friendly . The atmosphere is fun and exciting , the food is absolutely amazing and full of delicious flavors . I would highly recommend to family and friends . A must try",1
5,"The food was beyond amazing! Everything was very fresh! The chai tea was the best I've ever had. And they kept refilling my glass.  The chicken was so tender, the rice was perfect, the red sauce was flavored perfectly.  I wish there was one in CT!",1
5,I wish I could give this place 10 stars! The food was incredible. Service was immaculate and the atmosphere is perfect. We waited outside for an hour to be seated and it was worth every moment! Don't let the line turn you away! A must go if you are in London.,1
5,"I have eaten around the world at some of the best restaurants, and I do not know if I have ever had a meal as flavorful as our afternoon fare at dishoom.  We visited at the recommendation of some colleagues and dishoom did not disappoint.  The decor is inviting and the food is bold.  As with any Indian cuisine, most dishes have a decent amount of spice, but I have to say that the clean heat to the dishes at Dishoom is something I rarely get with the Indian dishes I try.  The Bhel (an appetizer) is a must try.  The chicken ruby and basmati rice are both incredible.  Well done Dishoom, we will be back.",1
3,"Came with really high expectations given the reviews and the line.
Lamb Samosas - Came out really fast. Were not hot or fresh. Tasted like they had been cooked earlier in the day and left under a warmer. The homemade samosas from my co-workers taste so much better.
Chicken Ruby - Tasted like it was made with canned tomato sauce.
Lamb Biryani - Again lamb was tough and not tender. Almost chalky, which again makes me think ""not fresh"". I cook with lamb very often and it's not difficult to get it tender. Rice had great flavor though.
Garlic Naan - Very good
Mango Kulfi - Very good
The Line - As I finished my meal I counted the number of empty seats upstairs and downstairs when I went to the restroom...the number of empty seats exceeded the number of people standing in line, which was about 20 people. So why the line? To create false sense of exclusivity or popularity? Or are there simply not enough staff to handle a full restaurant?
Overall, I say it's okay but not worth an 1+ hour wait in line.",-1
5,"Dishoom was so good. Most of the reviews on Yelp probably already explain it all but to reiterate, I am very satisfied with my time there. 
I came by on my way to the airport so I was by myself but the food is definitely prepared in a way for sharing. I would love to go back with a group and try a bunch more things. 
The staff was very accommodating to me, the put my luggage in the back room which was amazing. It took up way too much room anyways. 
There was a line but it goes quick and it really is worth it. They send you down to the bar first and then when a table is ready they seat you. I didn't try any of the drinks this time around but they looked great. I definitely want to come back and experience Dishoom again :)",1
5,"Have been here several times, and the food is always amazing.  Service varies but the place can often get hectic!  Have loved every dish we've tried.  Also highly recommend their brunch--it has converted my opinion on chicken liver forever :)",1
2,"It's ok. Not ""blown away"" by anything going on here. It's indian food in a hip environment. Bartenders seem good. Food is ok. Stay away from the weird desserts.",-1
5,"It's true, the best Indian food in the world (including India) is in England, and Dishoom is an example of that. 
Hubs and I went around 10pm on a Monday night and were seated right away, no reservations. The decor is stylish, modern, and trendy, unlike any other Indian restaurant I've been to back in California. 
The service was great, everyone was friendly and food came out promptly. 
What we ordered:
Chai tea: as good as everyone says!
Keema pau: sooo good. Get it!
Black daahl: nothing impressive...I didn't prefer it
Chicken Ruby: bursting with flavor! My favorite dish.
Garlic naan: perfectly toasted and light, with clumps of fresh garlic. It came out fresh and hot.
If I lived in London, I'd eat here all the time!",1
1,"I can only postulate the kitsch of eating indian food in the heart of london and the assumption that a long line must mean great food has brought this place unwarranted attention.  The wait in line is about 45 min. as they refused to take a reservation from me when I passed by the restaurant earlier in the afternoon.  The other people in line (whether London natives or tourists, I don't know) and of course the two hosts at the door raved about the place and assured me that the wait would be worth it.
First: this is NOT authentic indian food, north, south, east, west, or heart of india, pakistan, bangladesh, Afghanistan, what have you.  It is FUSION.  For those who already knew that, i'm just stating the obvious then.  For those who didn't, this is fusion, pan-indian, and likely not what you will find if you visited any of the above countries.  
Second: the food is spicy.  I like spicy food, but it seemed to me that the vast majority of their dishes were spicy and there was not much variation.  Even the okra fries!
Third: The kacchi lamb dish (cubes of dry lamb under a mound of rice) is by far the driest piece of rubbish I have ever tasted in my life.  I had to cut it up into little tiny pieces, douse it in their black daal before I could even eat the thing.  Utterly horrible.  I'm also not quite sure what the hype is over this black daal.  Not amused.
Last: To end on a good note, service is very good as they are attentive and helpful.  In a city that makes you bleed money, this place is actually relatively affordable.  But overall, not worth the wait, not even for 45 seconds.",-1
2,"This is a very strange restaurant. Styled after Irani cafés of yore? LOL. No. Styled after PF Chang's? Quite possibly. Food is just fine--over-spiced and lacking subtlety or variety of flavor but made with fresh ingredients. A request for ""extra yogurt on side"" got me a vat of the stuff. Chai spice is VERY PRESENT but fails to complement the tea, masking it instead. The food may have the right components, but the soul necessary to combine them properly isn't there. The ambiance is Corporate Chain inside a Mall of America. Staff was pleasant!",-1
1,"I can't believe this place is getting such excellent reviews! No, I'm really shocked! The food is so commercial but then again I saw a lot of tourists in line. Yes, there is a line to get into this place, and yes, I waited on it! So annoyed that I did. There were empty tables for way too long as people waited out in the cold. They are not seating people intentionally to cast an impression that people are dying to get in! Back to food: salty, commercial Indian. My Ruby chicken was cold. My okra fries were way too salty. This is basically the TJ Friday's of Indian! Man, what a hoax.",-1
5,Bacon and egg naan wrap was probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. Service was excellent too. Highly recommend it.,1
5,"Amazing food, very nice ambiance. Absolutely recommend! We had a bunch of dishes to share, which was the recommendation of our waiter. All the dishes we tried were tasty and of great quality. Will definitely go back again.",1
4,"I had heard great things about Dishoom, and made up my mind to visit the next time I was in London! My first attempt was on a Sunday at 2PM, and even then was told that the wait would be 1.5 hours!! I decided I would put my name down, but then was super confused when the greeters immediately ushered me downstairs and to the bar -- apparently, you have to wait for your spot either at the bar or right outside the restaurant aka I couldn't go and shop or do anything while I waited.... No thank you! 
I tried again the next day around 12:30PM for lunch and this time was pleasantly surprised when I immediately got a table (I was eating alone so that's probably part of the reason!). I usually don't mind eating alone but this time felt really uncomfortable for the first 8-10 minutes when I was clearly waiting to order but none of the 5 waiters in the area bothered stopping by.
Eventually I got the waitress' attention and she suggested that I try the chicken ruby (aka butter chicken) with garlic naan, which is exactly what I did! The garlic naan was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! Just the right amount of crispy, still soft, and the garlic flavor was perfect. The chicken was spicy (which I love) but wasn't as fantastic as I had hoped -- I wish it were a bit creamier, but the meat was sumptuous and overall quite a good meal.
One thing to note: for a 5'4"" girl, the food portions were perfect! However, it can be a bit pricy for the amount that you get, especially the chai latte which was microscopic! Still delicious, just a heads up to order more naan or another dish if you're very hungry!!",1
4,"The food is really good!  Why the 4 stars instead of 5?? The line was insanely long.  55 minutes long.
what irked me the most: 35-40 min into the wait, I see a table clear up.  Fine, I didn't think it was going to go to me anyway.  They tell me to go downstairs to the bar and have a drink b/c it looks like it'll be another 20 minutes.  Fine, I oblige.   I order drinks and they tell me my table is ready.  Low and behold it was the table that freed up and sat empty for 15-20 minutes while they get me to order drinks at the bar. Whatever
That aside, the food was delicious.   When it is labeled SPICY, they are serious! The chicken tikka set my mouth on fire.",1
5,"Came here on a Sunday after a trip to Stonehenge and Bath at around 10PM and were seated right away downstairs. I actually loved the atmosphere downstairs and would have preferred to sit down there rather than upstairs. We ordered the lamb samosas, garlic naan, black house daal, and chicken ruby. Everything was SO delicious! My favorite was the black house daal though - it's vegetarian and they cook it for 24 hours so it's super flavorful. 
We also ordered drinks, which were pretty good too!
The prices are totally reasonable so would totally come back for another meal if/when we come back to London!",1
5,"The queue is very long but it is definitely worth the wait! 
You can have some lassi while waiting
and the food!!! excellent. 
We ate vegetarian and it was one of the best indian food I ever had!",1
5,"Great food and atmosphere, as well as good service. Make sure to go during off hours to avoid the crazy wait times as it is super popular for dinner!",1
5,"Apologies that this review is a year overdue, but it is important to echo what no doubt so many others have said: Dishoom is a truly exceptional restaurant that provided what may have been the best Indian meal of our lives.
Everything we had was stunningly, confoundingly good.
But on top of that, the whole operation was excellently managed.
The services was incredibly prompt. Eerily prompt.  60 seconds prompt. We ordered, and suddenly there were amazingly delicious greens at our table.
Even the bar was well-considered; We enjoyed a fantastic whiskey cocktail that I still think about and smile. 
We also had a chicken tikka that the draft of this review describes as ""Best tikka ever.""
This was one of the happiest meals we've ever enjoyed. Thanks to management and staff for creating such a thoughtful, delightful experience.",1
5,"One of three branches of this innovative and incredibly popular Indian eatery in London, Dishoom was a revelation, not least because it served breakfast like no other I've had, and gave me the chance to try for the first time a cup of spicy milky chai. Yum! It was also vegetarian friendly.
Smart classy vibe in the dining room, jolly and helpful staff Dishoom offered a small but perfectly formed breakfast/brunch menu that features eggs or bacon in naan, Bombay omlette, spicy cheese toast and more. Whet your appetite by checking it out online.  If this is how they start the day I can't wait to try the dinner menu. Definitely one to put on the recommended list!
Free wifi with no sign-in required. Look for 'ChaiFai"".",1
5,"Absolutely incredible. Tastebuds popping flavors in a dimly lit, eclectic venue. The most tender chicken I've ever tasted. I will be trying their signature dish a another location soon!",1
1,Small portions over rated Indian. Much better Indian food available in London. We left hungry,-1
5,"When friends visit London and ask me for a food recommendation, I tell them to go to Dishoom.
Dishoom is an iconic London restaurant for a reason. The cocktails are impressive and always worth getting (I love me a Bombay Pimms or a Chaijito), the service is great, and the food is incredible. Some of my favorites are:
- Black daal: a must
- Chicken ruby: another must
- Dishoom calamari
- Roomali roti
- Chai (duh)
Surprisingly not my favorite:
- Chocolate chai
Tip: Come at an odd time, otherwise you'll be queueing for a while (but at least they give you free chai -- or sherry! -- while you wait).",1
5,"WOW! Simply WOW. This is a intense, yet refined and polished Indian experience. The food was nothing short of world class. Service? AMAZING.  Drinks, although I didn't think Indians were well known for their alcohol, we really spectacular. 
This place was DEFINITELY one of the highlights of our trip to london. When we return to Europe, I will ensure that Dishoom is a possibility for one of our stops. 
Can I give more than 5 stars?",1
5,"The hype is real. There was an hour long wait when we arrived at 8:30 and continued to be the case when we left at 10:30. Once you do finally score a table, the food comes out quickly after ordering, but you can also while away the time sipping on their many delicious libation offerings.
The food is so good! Perfectly seasoned, spiced and cooked. We didn't have one bad bite. My life was changed as soon as I sunk my teeth into cheese naan, which I didn't even know existed!!! 
My two kids (ages 4 & 8) had Indian food for the first time here...Dishoom may have set the bar too high, whoops!",1
4,The service is good except for the receptionist is too busy to welcome coming guest. Even though the interior setting is very simple and lack of identity.,1
5,"One of my favorite spots to go to in London. They not only have a huge variety of food, but everything that I've had is great. It's mostly plates to share so best to go with a partner or a few friends so you can try as much as possible. They have lots of vegetarian friendly options and have always been very accommodating. Interior is also decorated very nicely.",1
5,"I'm not a huge Indian food fan but thought I'd trust the perpetual line outside of this place and I'm so glad I did. Amazing food and service and the price point was pretty good too. 
Here is what we ordered: 
-Okra Fries 
-Naan
-Black Daal (Amazing curry)
-Gunpowder Potatoes
-Lamb Roti (Spicy, good but not great)
-Bowl of Greens 
-Far Far
Expect a long wait (we were quoted an hour which is a short quote from what I hear but we came later - around 9:15pm) and they were actually able to get us in in 30 minutes. In line, the hosts came by to offer choice of complimentary tea or Sherry which was appreciated!",1
5,"I loveddd Dishoom! All the food and drinks are amazing. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. The chicken ruby, the garlic naan, chicken tikka, bowl of greens, mango and fennel lassi, bombay colada. All solid and super inexpensive. I ate here twice... Please come to NYC!",1
5,"The staff is SO friendly!! The food is THE BEST Indian food, but the wait can be 1 hour or more on a Friday afternoon. So worth it! The yogurt in the lassis is so fresh; truly superior.",1
5,"We had heard so much about Dishoom, from friends and colleagues and everyone asked us to try it when we told them we were visiting London. I was almost sure I would be let down because this was just too much hype, but boy Dishoom delivers. To start off, there is always a wait, we tried thrice, at three different times and there was a wait each time. We waited for about 30 minutes, the line moved quickly. We waited at the bar for 10 minutes and their cocktails are pretty amazing, we had the chili martini, pimms and an old fashioned and everything was great. A friend tried the sweet and salty nimbu soda (lemon soda) which was so authentic, just like the ones we used to have as kids and they even let us adjust the salt to sweet ratio! 
We ordered a lot of food and nothing disappointed. For starters we had chilli cheese toast, vada pau, bhel puri and paneer tikka. The paneer tikka and Vada pau were exceptionally good ! Chilli cheese toast is a childhood favorite so that was my personal favorite. For the main course we had the black dal, a couple of chicken biryanis and the Chana Batura, the dal and Batura were lip smacking good. Can't fault the food in this place, it's really tasty. We were too stuffed to the dessert or have coffee and chai. If only they were not so crowded all the time we would have had a few more meals here. I especially like the sound of their breakfast menu. Until next time Dishoom,it's time to open one in NYC !! 
The service was lovely. Attentive and very polite even though they were handling such huge crowds.",1
5,"Superb vegetarian curry with tofu and garlic naan! Dishoom slaw had too much mayo but pomegranate seeds in it were very good. We did not have to wait because we went in for early lunch around 12. The waiter was nice and helpful and very attentive. Overall, it was  the best Indian restaurant experience I had.",1
5,"I've been to a few Indian restaurants in the U.S., but none of them has ever come close to Dishoom. A friend and I had to wait in line for 45 minutes on a Monday night when I was in London. During the wait, they handed out some hot water with mint as it was chilly and raining in London that night.
As soon as we were seated, they took our orders. The food here is served tapas style (small plates that can be shared amongst your party). 
1) Chicken Ruby - It is very similar to chicken tikka masala. It has a delicious, creamy tomato-based sauce that is very flavorful. Hands down, one of the best dish Indian dishes I've had in my life.
2) Black House Daal - Although this dish was flavorful, it didn't stand out to me as much, probably because it was overshadowed by the other dishes we ordered.
3) Vegetable biryani - I think the biryani could have used some more flavor. I personally didn't think there was anything special about this dish. I would assume their lamb biryani is tastier, and I would definitely order that instead when I come back. 
4) Mattar Paneer - The tomato-sauce base is very similar to the Chicken Ruby's, but with panner and vegetables instead of chicken. My friend is a vegetarian and really enjoyed this dish; highly recommended for the vegetarians.
5) Garlic Naan - The naan is crispy on the edges and chewy, soft, and buttery on the inside, just the way I like my naan. They definitely does not skimp out on the garlic flavor of the naan. It is delicious! I would book a flight to London today just for this if I could.
6) House Chai - The perfect balance of sugar, spice, and everything nice in one hot drink, perfect for a chilly London evening.
I would definitely come back to Dishoom when I visit London again.",1
3,"Go for breakfast its great. Bacon wrapped in nan bread smothered in ghee....I mean yes! The Indian spiced omelette yes! The free refills on chai...YES!
Never go for dinner unless you like a 2 hour wait.....! needs to start taking reservations its just too busy for this turn up an queue malarky.",-1
5,"Lunch reservations are typically easy to get , and we made one during our visit to London. I was afraid that all that hype will come crashing down with the first bite , but this was different. Food for most part is excellent , service is quick and efficient. Prawn koliwada was my personal fav. Lamb roast was soft as butter. Desserts are meh.",1
1,"I really wanted to write a 4 star review after my lunch several weeks ago but I can't...
The food was really delicious but 1/2 weeks after we had lunch at Dishoom they send me an email telling me (in a diverted but not subtle way)that they would love to offer me breakfast if I put a good review on yelp or trip advisor. It is a shame to do such things and I really don't understand since they have hundreds of really good reviews... 
Here I am Dishoom with my 1 star review!",-1
5,"This was the BEST Indian food I've EVER had!! And this is coming from someone who's been to India multiple times on family visits. I'd give you guys 10 stars out of 5 if I could!!
First off, the wait to get in was over an hour; but seeing as this is surrounded by tons of other restaurants, that was a good sign. The staff was nice enough to bring hot masala chai and mint tea to people waiting outside in queue.
Once inside, I ordered vegetable samosas followed by chhole bhatura. I mean, I'd heard about how great Indian food is in London but DAYUM!! This definitely hit the spot.
If you find yourself in London, please don't leave without eating at one of their locations or you'll be missing out!",1
5,"When Traveling to London, a name that kept popping up was Dishoom. A Persian inspired Bombay Cafe. The menu had so many yummy things to try. My dad makes Zereshk Polo (Persian Rice with Barberries & Saffron) so I was interested to see what their take would be. It definitely hit home, however was elevated by the Indian spices, it was one tasty meal!",1
5,"I wish Dishoom would open up a restaurant in Chicago, because I freakin love this place!  I got there on a Saturday around noon and didn't have to wait at all.  I love breakfast and they didn't disappoint one bit.
Their Bacon Naan Roll and House Chai combo is probably one of my favorite breakfasts, after having it just once.  Easily the best Chai I've ever had and wish I had some right now.  I loved the Bacon Naan Roll and how could you not?  Yout get some  back bacon, chili tomato jam, cream cheese, and some herbs, all rolled up in some freshly baked naan.  It's the perfect combination of salty, sweet, and naan.
If you have trouble finding the place, you can't miss the colorful bicycles out front.",1
5,"A very nice experience of Indian food in London. This place gets my five star and no wonder why are they so busy.
I went with my wife and my cousin and his wife. We were in the queue waiting for our turns and they served us either Indian tea or mint drink which in itself a great hospitality that they start thinking about their customers even before they dine in with the restaurant. 
We were seated after 40-45 mins of wait. We orders everything in the world from chicken tikka, seekh kabab, chicken biryani, daal makhani, bhaang lassi, naan etc etc. I will say each and every cuisine is authentic. 
Ambience is full of Bollywood theme, staff is extremely courteous and soft spoken. The food is of par excellence and what else do you want from a place that provides you with great eating experience for dinner?
Your $ or £ won't go waste here. Worth trying if you are traveling to London or living here.",1
4,First day in London. Great staff. Good choices and good quality. It is busy so make reservations. Kids liked matter paneer.,1
3,"Ahhh. What went wrong?? Where was my amazing Indian culinary experience? After weeks of hearing about how amazing Dishoom was, I finally made it to Covent Garden. After 30 minutes in line (6:30 pm on a Thursday), we got a table. 
Between the two of us, we shared the Paneer Tikka, Gunpowder potatoes, Black House Daal, Paneer roll, and Mahi Tikka. Unfortunately, none of the dishes stood out in terms of flavor profile. Good, but not memorable. I expected the dark and deep flavors of the Black House Daal to mesmerize me, but it was served room temperature and more porridge-y. The Mahi in the Mahi Tikka was tender, but didn't contrast with anything, let alone the yogurt it was served with. I did get a lot of the charred, smoky flavor in the Paneer Tikka, but then again that was it. The Gunpowder potatoes were also disappointing. I didn't get the aroma from seeds or herbs at all. 
I really really wanted to fall in love with this restaurant. I think it must be the hype as well as the way all the dishes are described on the menu that makes you have higher expectations. Dishoom was just ok. I wouldn't return for the price.",-1
5,"I love this restaurant! Been here 5 times now and everyone I bring here also ends up loving it  I have tried the lunch/dinner menu here and both the veg and non-veg dishes are delicious. My favourites being calamari, Lamb boti, ruby chicken and roomali roti. I've had the coke float once, but was not available on the last 2 occasions I have been here, so that's the only disappointing thing about my trip, which is not bad. 
The customer service is amazing. They always put the customer 1st, which I believe is also why you'll always see people queuing some time for a table. On this trip, I did not make a reservation and queued I think half an hour and I had the opportunity to try the free chai offered. It was so delicious!! 
I have already made a reservation to go for breakfast next month",1
5,"Unquestionably the best Indian place in London. The prices are very reasonable and the food is just spectacular! If you don't reserve a table beforehand, you'll probably have to wait in line though. But no worries: they have free chai and sherry for the people waiting.",1
5,We ordered everything on the dang menu. Everything was super tasty and very flavorful. Not the cheapest food but the food doesn't disappoint. Wish they opened one up in LA.,1
4,"Came here for a late lunch - must have at least one Indian meal while visiting London!  Restaurant was packed and the wait was 30 mins.  Their manager was kind to bring us all a free small glass of chai tea - basically a nice milk tea with a good dose of cinnamon that perked up the senses!
I ordered their grilled Dishoom Chicken Tikka with a side of basmati rice and garlic nann.  Chicken was light on sauce which I like, but intensely flavored, well seasoned and best of all cooked perfectly juicy.  Garlic naan was buttery, hot, and almost crispy - I liked the three dipping sauces that range from salty to sweet to barely spicy.  The rice came in a good sized bowl, and although plain was essential for accompanying the strong flavors.
I passed on dessert but got a Virgin Bombay Colada - a nice play on a Piña Colada but it was green (perhaps from mint) with a nice topping of fennel seeds and other spices for effect.  Not bad!  Note that still water is charged by the bottle.",1
5,"The food here takes your taste buds on a rollercoaster. Lamb samosas, black daal, garlic naan, and basmati rice. It was to die for. The chai is smooth with a kick of spice as you swallow. Delicious and warm.",1
5,"Dishoom is amazing. First off, we actually went to the Kings Cross branch in Granary Square. I went once with a friend and once with a group of 11 college students. The food is amazing, and really that's all that really matters. For dinner I had the lamb awadhi biryani and its so rare to actually get a proper biryani anywhere.Roomali roti is another thing you can't get outside India very much, and their version is fantastic. 
But I actually really loved the breakfast. The kejriwal, chilli cheese toast with eggs was amazing. Also bun maska and chai in proper chai glasses. What more could you want? 
The lines do get seriously absurdly long. We arrived right at 5 and had no wait. And for breakfast since we had a group of over 6 we were able to make a reservation.
It really is worth the hype.",1
4,Very good! Sad that we didn't get to try it for dinner since the line was too long and it was raining but I can understand why it's so popular!,1
5,"My fellow Americans, you need to get your butts here for a meal before that old orange turd running as the GOP's 2016 presidential candidate decides to ban England, Indian food and god knows what else. Which would be ironic because the curry here is so delicious and potent he could probably bottle it and market it as 'Trump Spray Tan'. 
The wait staff is awesome: they helped guide us through the expansive menu, pick items to our taste and pair them with other great options. I wish I could tell you what we ordered but I can't pronounce any of it. Sorry Donald but THESE guys have the best words.",1
4,"Had their take on the full english breakfast. The bacon was top-notch, and the akuri eggs were delicious. Otherwise, it's just a full english with an indo-farsi twist, which is in itself cool but maybe not the best choice either for an authentic full english or with respect to Dishoom's other offerings.
I didn't like their lassi (as I wasn't aware it's more-than-a-bit salty!) but the staff were nice enough not to charge for it and I ordered their great chai instead.
I will definitely return for lunch as well.",1
3,"I know, I know. It's Londoners' official favourite restaurant and yet, only three stars from me? Who do I think I am to contest the opinion of the masses eh?
Well, to be honest, I just didn't find the food to be quite up to speed. The cocktails were fabulous, and so is the decoration (those mirrors!!), the staff was lovely and pudding was quite wonderful, but the rest could simply have been better. 
It was mainly lacking the balance and complexity of flavour I was expecting from such a high reputation restaurant. 
... So as far as I'm concerned, the quest for London's best Indian restaurant is still on!
(I still have to try Dishoom's breakfast, which I've only heard good things about though... i'll keep you posted)",-1
5,"Love this place too! Have been quite a few times now! Just keep in mind Indian cuisine is insanely varied with very different style depending on the regions, Dishoom takes you to the old Irani Cafes of Bombay!! Everything about it takes you there - obviously the food and the smell but also the beautiful decor and the insane attention to detail! Staff has always been more than friendly. It's often very busy and requires queue but lovely touch as the staff offers you complimentary chai or mint tea whilst you wait. 
Let's start with a quick review of the breakfast menu - unfortunately for my liking breakfast menu at the weekend is only served until 11.45am... I mean seriously? That's not right! I tried to go couple times and failed! Successfully got there once at the weekend. However, I am lucky enough to work in media industry which means I have the privilege to take clients out and a Dishoom Breakfast is always a success! Love the bacon & egg naan bread - simple, basic but excellent. The Mango Lassi is to die for!! Absolutely delicious, not technically on the breakfast menu but it's not a problem for them. 
Before moving on to the lunch/dinner menu I do want to mention the cocktails! Oh my! Their Bombay Colada & the Edwina's affair are to die for! Amazing flavoursome twist to classics! 
Finally, the food... The Chicken Ruby is an absolute must. The Okra fries are genius. The sauces dishes are amazing to dip with your garlic or cheese naan! But even the less saucy dishes are cooked to perfection. Slight disappointment with the paneer roll to be honest. It was good but not extraordinary. I think it's more something to have on the go so perhaps doesn't work so well at a sit down dinner. I don't know, the flavours were there but just wasn't really working for me. Finally the puddings! That chocolate fondant with the chilli ice cream is great! Wobbles & melts in your plate and then your mouth, amazing combination with the ice cream. Otherwise you cannot go wrong with the kulfi on a stick!",1
5,Loved it! Best place to try some Indian cuisine and experience a retro setting! The appetizers were great!,1
5,"A very nice Indian food in London, probably the best in my past year.
The inner decorations are fashion and it is a good place to have either lunch or dinner.
But you need to prepare that you will always need to wait in lines for a table for dinner, this restaurant is so popular lol
try their coven garden special one and which is a curry soup comes with shrimp and white rice",1
4,"Fantastic food, drinks and atmosphere.
We arrived at 6pm on a Monday eve and had to wait 20 minutes for a table of 2, but it was a nice evening so fine to wait outside and the staff gave out the occasional glass of lemonade and chai tea to those in the queue.
The only dampener on the meal was the supervisor on the basement floor. She came to our table 4 times to ask how our meal was going, so on top of being checked on by the waiting staff this was a bit of an over kill.",1
4,"I was worried this was just a hype and got abit fidgety in the queue. But yes, the hype is true, its awesome food. Very creative, very tasty. Dishoom is a well oiled machine with polite staff and great seating surroundings.",1
4,"The food is simply delightful - full stop. Without any doubt this is the best Punjabi food I've had for a long time.
I particularly liked he starters, such as lamb chops and also kebab. My partner had Tandoor chicken and loved it too.
Price wise it's actually quite ok!
Amazing mixture of very affordable and really tasty food so will definitely repeat.",1
5,"Wife and I started our holiday in London last week and a friend recommended this place was worth a visit. I couldn't agree more. We both had no problem admitting this was the best food we had on the trip and the best indian food we've ever had!!!
We had the ruby chicken and the vegetable samosas - both were so good. Also the dishoom IPA was a great beer - the best I've which was brewed exclusively for a restaurant.  
If you're going to go, know there is usually a queue. We tried to go early around 5 and still had to wait around 30 minutes for a table of 2. While we were waiting, they came around twice with complimentary chai tea samples which was awesome!
This is a place I will go out of my way to visit every time I'm in London. Exceptional service meets even better food and at a really good value - make sure you plan a visit!",1
5,"I will never get tired of coming here. Yet to find a place that's better to work in. Once you get through the epic queues (top tip: morning or late lunch work best), there's no timed limit on how long you can keep your table and the chai gets you bottomless refills. The staff are always friendly and the food is heavenly, if you're so tempted. Plus there's decent free wifi!",1
5,"This one has been on my bookmarks list for a while. I admit it was there more for the prospect of a bacon naan. My wife had noticed it too and suggested we try it out for lunch on her birthday. While we didn't have a bacon naan, the decision was inspired and we had a lunch which surpassed our expectations.
We chose several dishes which covered most parts of the menu. We ate until we had crossed the line marked ""full"" and we had no regrets. My favourite choice was the spicy lamb chops: great flavour, not overpowering, and as tender as you like. The black house daal was also well-liked.
I ordered the house chai and later found out that I could have unlimited refills! For those who are on the edge of deciding whether to visit, that should push you over.",1
5,"There are some places worth traveling to eat. As a Californian, I can say that Dishoom is worth paying for a round trip Trans-Atlantic flight to eat at.
In particular the Bhel salad stands out as being one of the most unique salads I've ever had. Other Bhel salads do not come close.
As a Vegetarian, this restaurant was incredible and to my meat-eating family, they loved it as well.
This is perhaps the most important thing to see and experience in London bar-none.",1
5,"In the climactic scene from a violent 80s bollywood flick, the hero is hanging off the edge of a cliff on one hand and as the villain bends down to say adios amigo, the hero suckerpunches him...DISHOOM!!
There you have it folks, it's onomatopoeia for an explosive fist punch in bollywood lingo and true to it's name, the restaurant has a very eclectic decor comprising of movie posters, film magazine covers, LPs and other memorabilia from yesteryears.
We had a long layover at Heathrow and our friends from town got lunch reservations here. We'd heard a lot about how good the Indian food in London is and we were eager to try it for real. 
For tipples (acting British now lol), we got a pitcher of the Bombay Pimm's which was quite refreshing. 
For appetizers, we got a Keema Pau (spiced minced lamb and peas served with a toasted buttered pau bun). The keema was out of this world and tasted very similar to what it would back home. What joy in every bite!
For the main course we went with the Chicken Ruby (recommended a lot on the other reviews) and the Haleem because it sounded delicious going by the description. 
The chicken ruby is a very tangy take on a traditional chicken makhani and the roomali roti is the perfect vehicle for scooping up the gravy. Slurp.
We were so engrossed in eating that we forgot about the Haleem (a slow-cooked dish with lamb, wheat, barley, lentils and spices) which arrived a few minutes later. The Haleem which came with a side order of naan and extra condiments like fried onions,  chillies and lemon had a very good consistency and a rustic flavor that makes us drool every time we think about it.
For dessert, our friends recommended the Memsahib's Mess (fresh cream with crushed meringue, strawberries, rose syrup and a rose petal preserve known as gulkand) which we demolished despite being full to the brim.
Easily one of the most memorable Indian meals that we've had outside of India. Too bad it's not a stone's throw away :(",1
5,"They will tell you that the wait is about 40-45 minutes but don't be desperate and stay in line because you will probably get in within the next 5 minutes for dinner without reservation
The must have dishes are the black daal, garlic naan and their signature chicken tikka. It is a bit spicy but sooo goood.
Their Bollybellini is a must try!
The staff is ok. The location great for some people watch if you sit outside.
A great dinner spot and a favourite of mine.
Will definitely be back anytime I am in London",1
4,"Great food! great atmosphere! what more could you ask for?! 
based in several locations around London! make sure to find and try one by you!
WARNING: you can not book, so if its a cold day ques could have you waiting outside! so wrap up warm!",1
4,"We loved this place for breakfast! My friend and I came here at 8am in the morning and found it empty for once (the line is SO LONG for dinner). 
I love the decor in here. It's chic, spacious, open and comfortable. Wafts of yummy smells also surround you as you sit waiting to order and eat. After looking at the menu, we had a hard time deciding so we decided to share the naan egg roll (around 5 pounds) and the granola with yogurt and fruit (5.60 pounds I think). Both were really good, especially the naan egg roll. This place is definitely underrated for breakfast!
The naan had that perfect chewy, doughy consistency and the two fried eggs were still slightly runny. The tomato spread, cream cheese and sweet chutney perfectly complemented each other. The portion is cut into two pieces, and perfect for one person. The granola with yogurt was a little bit too sweet for our tastes, but it was still really good with vanilla yogurt, honey, fresh fruits (melon, pineapple, grapes, blueberries) and the contrasting texture of crunchy granola.
We also ordered coffees (2.50 pounds for an iced Americano or latte). My Americano was probably the best coffee I've had since coming to England and so, so worth it. 
I definitely recommend this place for a quality breakfast at a reasonable price!!",1
4,"DISHOOM DISHOOM! Is this the sound of a Bollywood punch?  Or perhaps as the menu suggested, the sound of the food zooming to your table? I tried to figure it out and after eating there, I personally think this is the sound of the flavours exploding in your mouth (Bollywood flavour punch in the mouth?)
The dish that had the punch was the famous house black daal, which was really delicious and full of exciting tastes. Nothing else I tried was quite so exciting, but the rightly popular pau bhaji was also a delicious mix of flavours and I loved it too. I have never had pau bhaji before and wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a lovely saucy vegetable mix packed with yumminess that you can eat with garlic naan or whatever bread you prefer. I also really enjoyed the chilli cheese toast, which was such a fun thing to order. Perhaps if I went back I might be able to continue the search for more dishoom flavour! :)
Now to less flavoursome dishes. The kacchi lamb biryani was just okay and had not much meat in it, so I wouldn't recommend it. The haleem was better but after a few bites got a bit boring. The masala chai and mango lassi were okay, but I have had better lassi and I don't believe I've ever found a place outside of the subcontinent that can make masala chai the same way. 
Surprisingly, I did enjoy the interestingly spelled Thums Up soda. Thums Up is the Indian Coca-Cola and tastes as if you left a can of coke next to a sack of cardamom, but in a surprisingly good way. The logo is a hand giving the thumbs up sign, and I really enjoyed the spelling after seeing that. The pistachio kulfi was a good way to end the meal, it wasn't the best I've had but was rich and sweet and hit the spot.
As people have said, there is a long wait to get in. I went around 6 and ended up outside in the rain for 45 minutes. Dishoom was kind enough to lend us an umbrella and also to pass out masala chai cups to people in line. I did notice though that after 8:30 on a weekday, there was no line at all, so if you don't want to stand in line, perhaps come around then instead and miss the early rush. 
Dishoom I notice, also has dates for people who are fasting during Ramadan if you ask for them, and has a special Eid menu coming up which notes that all chicken and lamb are always halal at Dishoom. I really like how considerate they are and look forward to going back again sometime! Their holi celebration also looked amazing on the website and I hope to go next year. They also have something special called a lamb raan bun, which you can only get at the Shoreditch branch, so I will definitely be checking that out!",1
3,"So before I go too far with this review, and before you stop reading it (as presumably you're aghast at only 3 stars), bear with me.
I hail from a part of Sydney with one of the highest concentrations of Indian population & restaurants in the country. Subsequently, I'm used to very good Indian food, from all regions of India. And when I say very good, I mean excellent.
Right, now that that's out of the way...
I trust Yelpers implicitly. I've had so many fantastic experiences by following Yelp reviews wherever I travel. Subsequently, I'm a little curious as to how high a rating Dishoom got. Don't get me wrong - it was all good. There was nothing bad about the meal I had. It's just that there was nothing stunning about the food I had. Maybe my expectations were too high as I had to wait almost an hour to get in. Maybe I'm just used to a different style of Indian food (maybe the food in Sydney was adjusted to local tastes?). Maybe I just got there on a not so good night? Or maybe my taste buds were just off?...
Regardless, if you're after a good feed, this place will give it to you. It was definitely satisfying. But then, balancing that with the price and the wait, maybe there's somewhere else you could go, for better food, less coin, and less of a wait?",-1
5,"We have eaten here a couple of times and it is in my top 5, and definitely my favourite Indian restaurant in London. For a vegetarian there was an amazing choice with the stand out Black Dahl. The cocktails were an extraordinary mix of east meets west. My highlight was the Bombay Colada.",1
5,"By far the best Indian food I've eve had! Despite the long wait, they make it the best possible experience for you while waiting. Only problem is they require you to wait in line the entire time. You can't leave and come back after putting your name down. We were quoted an hour and a half wait but made it in after an hour. While you wait in line they provide you drinks outside! 
Everything we ordered was fantastic. The okra fries were well seasoned and really crunchy. I'm not a fan of okra but these changed my mind. We also ordered the lamb chops , garlic naan, prawn Moilee   And phau  bhaji. Enjoyed every dish equally. Make sure to come here!!!",1
5,Awesome Food with Great service!! A must go place if you like Indian food,1
5,"Though we had to wait about 2 hours, it was totally worth it. Best Indian food I've ever had, and I'm an American from San Francisco. This place is super nice and fancy without the prices breaking the wallet, either. Though the line is long, they bring you free Sherry shots and chai tea/mint tea while you wait with your group.",1
4,"Having been to the Dishoom in King's Cross for lunch, I came to this one in Covent Garden for brunch a month later. While still great, I think the first experience was transcendental, so this one loses a star for not quite matching up. 
Good points:
- It's a fun, attractive, interesting restaurant, with lots to catch the eye.
- Food is good quality and tasty.
- The chai tea is beautifully done.
- The fire toast was simple but tasty.
- It's very good value! The bacon naan was £5.20, I think.
Less good points (note that these are all in comparison to King's Cross - so are me being picky rather than very unhappy):
- The staff seemed very rushed and harried - we didn't really get a smile out of them and felt a little under pressure. The King's Cross branch had much friendlier staff.
- I was a bit underwhelmed by my bacon and egg naan - I think my expectations had been built up too much. But in particular, I was annoyed that there were green onions cooked into my egg, because I hate them, and this wasn't on the menu. In addition, my egg wasn't runny. 
- It's not as interesting a space as King's Cross, despite the details.
I'm DEFINITELY going back to Dishoom, but probably for lunch or dinner, and either trying out the Shoreditch one or going back to King's Cross.",1
5,"DIshoom is one of my favorite restaurants in London. I went there twice on my last visit. I always get the vegetable samosas as a starter - they are crispy and come with three great chutneys (the mint chutney being my favorite). When ordering a main dish one thing to note is that few of Dishoom's items are curry-based, meaning that they are just meat options. If you want something with a curry Mattar Paneer or the Chicken Ruby. I'm a huge fan of the chicken ruby - it's the perfect mix of spicy flavorful and goes well with the Romali Roti. I've also had Lamb Boti Kabobs and the Dishoom Chicken Tikka - both are great but again they just come with meat so I don't recommend ordering a naan or rice with it. This restaurant is usually quite crowded during prime lunch and dinner time but the wait was never terribly long for me. 
Overall: one of my favorites in London, amazing Indian food, cool ambiance",1
5,"Amazing breakfast. Typically friendly service delivered by charming young staff. Get the chicken ruby and an old fashioned at dinner time and it won't disappoint.
Bacon naan roll is a tasty treat and the coffee is magic. It ain't cheap, but value for money-wise it's hard to beat.",1
5,"Oh my gosh. Food heaven. Definitely worth the queue, so don't be put off by the no booking policy! 
Amazing service from start to finish. They bring out chai lattes (and umbrellas if it's rainy) in the queue, then you can wait in the bar for a table. Gave us a chance to try their cocktails - the bombaylinis are divine!
The main restaurant is really dynamic, an atmospheric blend of Asian decor and modern urban lighting. You can see the chefs at work, so you know everything's really fresh!
It's etiquette to order a load of dishes and graze together; they had a gorgeous selection of plates, including marinated meat from the grill, curries, fish and vegetarian dishes. Beautiful lamb chops and daal, and plenty of sundries to soak it up...
Got to save room for a dessert - even if it's just a pistachio kulfi (ice cream lolly)... Delicious end to an amazing meal, certainly lived up the reviews!",1
4,Amazing! Best samosas I've ever had! The chicken ruby dish was outstanding and so was the naan. Our waitress was outstanding. We did have to wait for about an hour and a half outside in the rain for a table but it was definitely worth it and they were handing out warm chai!,1
5,"One of the best Indian meals I've had while studying abroad in London, and I have exceptionally high standards for Indian food!
Not too expensive, I definitely recommend ordering family style here. The interior is really cute as well.
Here's what I've had:
Kheema Roll - yum, the Kheema is soft (is that a weird way to describe kheema??) and flavorful. 
Roomali roti - super thin and soft, just the way it should be
Maahi tikka - delicious and flaky.
Daal - this is amazing dal.
Tip: Make a reservation if possible. Also, they'll tell you the wait is much longer than it really is...sit tight. They're trying to weed out the Covent Garden passers-by from the people who really want to eat there!",1
5,"Worth the wait, have the house black daal. Very trendy and yet amazing food. The ambiance is awesome, the service was on point and the food fantastic. Mind you you will wait at the door for a table but you'll soon know why",1
4,"Went here for an afternoon lunch on a Sunday (around 2-3pm) - quite a long wait of about 1 hour and 30 minutes. After about 45 minutes waiting outside in the cold, they bring you inside. You think that you've finally made it, but instead they give you a buzzer and sit you at the bar!
Anyway - food-wise, it was phenomenal. Great authentic indian dishes - I don't recommend ordering both the curries as they are the same base (but one with chicken and the other one with paneer - I wish they had clarified this with us earlier). Otherwise, the curry on its own was great! The chicken-tikka wrap was mediocre, also - but everything else was fab. Small portions and relatively pricey, but thats what you get in return for the ambiance and beautiful decorations.",1
5,"I absolutely love Dishoom! 
That's as good as intro I'll ever write..
Brunch is obviously my favourite (I'm a brunchaholic)
Have the egg + bacon naan and the scrambled eggs are also to die for! 
In terms of other food, I love the Chicken Ruby and the squid. And if I could make those gunpowder potatoes every day I would!
Also - that watermelon mocktail is as good as a drink without alcohol can get ;)",1
5,"There's no way around it: Dishoom is a ""thing"".
If you go in the morning, you get a tasty ""breakfast thing"". If you go for lunch, you get ""a delectable, cacophonous lunch thing."" And if you go for dinner, you get ""a stand in line for an hour in drizzle thing"".
For Dishoom is well past discovered and isn't likely to return to ambiguity in any forseeable future.
So, you're gonna have to deal with ""the thing"". It is worth it?
Absolutely.
I've been here over a dozen times and have never been disappointed. From the Gunpowder Potatoes with lime zest, to Okra Fries, to any of the curries...Dishoom is amaze-balls. The environs are well-appointed. Kind of a ""dark wood and eclectic trappings from the East India Company thing"". The waitstaff is prompt, high professional, and handles the chaos with aplomb. The prices are a tad on the high-side for curry, but reasonable. The beer - several of which are made expressly for Dishoom - is YUM.
So the only thing is ""the thing"". You're gonna have to deal with the wait, and crowds, and noise.
Or are you? In the years I've been going to Dishoom it's added three more locations. I haven't been to all of them, but I can tell you ones I have been to are way less crowded than St. Martin's Lane.
So go have a night in any of the others, and leave the chaos for those not in the know. You'll have a spectacular thing.",1
5,"Hands down the best Indian food I've ever had.  While we did wait about an hour to be seated, aroind half of that time was inside the restaurant at the bar downstairs.  Be prepared to wait an hour or so as the line never shortens, but make sure to come hungry and leave satisfied.  
The service, drinks, menu and overall experience was 5-star.  I will make it a point to recommend this restaurant to everyone who plans to visit London.",1
5,OMG!!! Visiting London from California with my mom. Selected this restaurant because of the yelp reviews. I can sum up this restaurant in one word: fantastic. Each and every bite was superb!! Mother is a very critical restaurant goer and she absolutely loved the food here. We started with vegetable samosas and then ordered the chef special prawn curry and grilled lamb chops and sautéed vegetables and garlic naan and a carafe of wine and we have a perfect meal. everything was seasoned well. We LOVED every morsel and didn't want dinner to end. I told my mom that I would consider staying an extra day in London just so I could eat here again!!!,1
5,"Everything about Dishoom was outstanding. WORTH THE WAIT!! Every single employee we encountered was cheerful and welcoming, the drinks were delicious, the food was out of this world (the prawn moilee and the black house daal were especially incredible).... but the service was the icing on the cake. Our waiter, Gabri, was fantastic. Friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, and gave great suggestions for food. All around one of the best experiences on our recent trip to London!",1
5,"Phenomenal. Came from United States and heard this place was amazing. It was every bit of it. The service, the food, the atmosphere--all great. Totally worth the hour and 40 minute wait. Definitely recommend. Sit with Arlind, best waiter I've had in a while!",1
4,"Great ambiance, average food & great service. I appreciate the modern Indian & Persian small plates but flavors were bland, which probably is how british prefer. They have a nice bar, worth the try",1
5,"Look here's the thing. Normally Indian food is not my Jam under any circumstances. And yet here I am giving an Indian restaurant 5 stars so it's not just a good Indian restaurant it's an amazing one, one that can make me forget what my overtly racist taste buds want me to eat.
I went ham with the ordering so here's what we got:
Vegetable Somosas- started off with a classic and it was a great start. Very standard no doubt but seasoned very well and fried perfectly. No complaints but also no unique twist on it.
Pau Bhaji- now things are getting interesting- ""a bowl of mashed vegetables"" is the description; what an understatement. Basically a vegetable tomato paste that was flat out delicious and the perfect dip for bread.
Okra Fries- and now we hit the jackpot. Fried okra that I swear was seasoned so much you would think it would be way too much but it worked perfectly. A punch of flavor in your mouth for sure, but an amazing one.
Awadhi Lamb- extremely tender and flavorful. Sauced like crazy but I wanted much more.
Garlic Naan- I mean it's Naan and bread is always gonna be delicious.
PSA- Ordered a second helping of Okra fries-they were that good.
It's on the lists of best restaurants in London and for good reason. The lines can be brutal but either show up away from peak hours or suck it up because those okra fries are worth every second waiting in that cold raining nightmare of a city :D",1
5,"Amazing Indian food!! Much better than anything I've had in New York or Boston. Firstly, Dishoom is a ""new bombay style"" Indian restaurant. I don't know exactly what this means but it is hip and trendy inside, not a mom and pop Indian place. However, despite this, the food tastes authentic and the clientele was about 50% Indian. 
We went here on a Friday night and it was so packed. First, we waited outside for about an hour. However, they kept bringing us brandy and hot chai tea so we didn't mind so much since we were having a great time drinking. Then, we were escorted to the bar area to wait where we ordered drinks and could have ordered appetizers if we wanted. And lastly, we were escorted to our table. Waited about 1 hr 45 mins in total. However, this was probably the most enjoyable long wait I have ever had for a table. Dishoom is organized and everything is electronic. Everyone knew my name and exactly how long I had waited for a table. It was quite a pleasant experience. 
I can't remember the names of the drinks we had but they were delicious. I also especially loved the hot spiced chai tea we had when we waited. Would definitely recommend ordering the chai tea. To eat, we had the garlic naan, chicken ruby, and black daal. I don't even like dark meat chicken but I loved the chicken ruby! It is very similar to chicken tikka masala but it has a unique flavor and I think is event better. The black daal was incredible and so buttery and filled with flavor. The food came out extremely quickly so even though we waited a long time for the table, we were eating within 10 minutes of sitting down. For dessert, we had some type of mango granola pudding that was also incredible. 
Definitely, definitely visit here. It is a unique experience you can't get anywhere else!",1
3,"When it comes to eating out i tend not to go for South Asian cuisine, reason being - My maa makes it better.
Anyway after all of the hype i went to Dishoom and i have to say i was not disappointed. 
However i would like to recommend this restaurant more for lunch and snack like cuisine.
I had the Samosa Chaat and Vada Pau both were perfect and i would have these again.
For main course I had Chicken Biryani and i have to say thats where my disappointment came from as it was not as rich as i had wanted it to be.
Nevertheless its off my list of places to check out and i would not mind visitng again.",-1
5,"The place to go for Indian in London. Went around 8pm on a Sunday evening and line was out the door. We we're told 30 minutes until we'd get inside to the bar, where we can order a drink and wait another 10-15 min till being seated. We decided to wait and thank god we did. We waited 15 minutes outside before going in, got to the bar to order a drink and within less than 5 minutes were given a table! I suppose they overestimate waiting time to avoid complaining customers, understandable.
Food - absolutely delicious and I'm not a huge Indian cuisine consumer. We ordered the Ruby Chicken, Black Daal, Chicken Tikka, Basmati Rice, Pau Bhaji, Lamb Boti Kabab and Garlic Naan. Everything was delicious and very flavourful.
Service - waiter was extremely helpful in suggesting different plates and the right amount. Also helped with understanding the flavours of each dish. 
Drinks - ordered the chilli martini which was sweet and delicious! 
Too stuffed for dessert, but based on the entrees I can predict its nothing short of amazing as well. Recommend to others visiting London.",1
5,"If I could give it 10 stars, I would. Don't even know where to begin. Bottom line: DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE. Unanimously voted worth waiting outside in line for an hour in the cold (sweetened by cups of chai and lemonade on the house - but don't worry, you can reserve tables too). 
Gimlet was the best I ever had. Bombay colada was fresh and heavenly. Calamari, black daal, and garlic naan were phenomenal. Also had chicken tikka and lamb biryani that were amazing. Our only regret was not ordering a side of basmati rice to spoon the remaining black daal and tikka sauce over. 
Service was very fast and attentive. Prices extremely reasonable. 
The decor. Don't even get me started! Modern chic brasserie with awesome vintage Indian film posters and pictures/ads. Cool lighting and fans spinning above head. Feels like a jump back to a modernized, chic, Bombay British colonial place.",1
5,"I wasn't sure the first time, or the 2nd time I went to Dishoom, but the 3rd time was the decider. This place deserves 5 stars.
There isn't a dish I have tired in 3 visits, that was bad, all of them fresh, tasty, and the perfect mix of items on the menu.
One of my favourite things, is the smell when you walk into the restaurant. The smell of Indian spices instantly hitting you, and instantly making you hungry!
The suggestion here is simple, get loads of starters and small plates to share, and then go for a main.
Some of my favourites are-
Lamb Samosa
Chilli cheese toast
Vada Pau
Calamari
Chicken Tikka
Masala Prawns
Stick some Nann bread on, a portion or rice and you are well on your way.
Controversial dessert-the Kulfi on a stick-bascially an ice lolly/ice cream, but its a great finish to the meal and a bit different!
There is no point in writing any more, Dishoom is a must, you will have heard of it, people will recommend it and it's well worth a visit!
Writing about it is making me crave it again!",1
3,"We came here as the reviews were good ... It did mention the wait but it fail to say it was not worth it . 
First, get ready for an unnecessary hour wait outside, the food is as good as any other Indian restaurant you will find in London, the wait do not warrant the quality of the food, we try quite a nice array 
The fried squid - it's oily no crispy 
The lamb Samoa - dry and tasteless 
The spicy lamb chops - dry, over cook
The garlic nam - was good 
The rice - basic steam rice 
The ruby Ryan - the star of the chef - ummm is ok nothing to brag about - chicken was little tough due to the long simmer 
Not against going as the staff is really friendly but not worth the wait ... The long line It's a marketing strategic to lore costumers in , by the way after waiting outside you get to wait at the bar as well before you get a table .
Happy eating !!!",-1
4,"Came here on a Sunday at 5pm and had a 45 minute wait for a party of four. 
The interior was nicely decorated and the fragrant smells were intoxicating. 
Service was mostly attentive. 
They were easily able to accommodate my gluten free and dairy free medical dietary restrictions (even had a menu for both).  The prawn moilee was by far the best dish we had. It was truly amazing! The chicken tikka was a distant second for me and the sheekh kabab was skippable. My spouse shared many other dishes with the others in our party and had the same sentiments at the end of the meal. 
The ingredients seemed fresh and of high quality, but especially for the price-point, we were sadly overall underwhelmed by the food. Not the value we were hoping for. 
Glad to have checked it off the list and grateful they were so accommodating to my dietary restrictions. Would go back for the prawn moilee alone though! :)",1
5,"I've only been here for breakfast, which is the easiest time of day to get a table. It's already bustling at 8am, but the wait staff are super friendly, and I looooveeee the dish with chicken liver.",1
5,"I ate at Dishoom my first night in London. For some reason I'd been under the impression food in the UK wouldn't be very good, but Dishoom took that notion and threw it out the window.
Firstly: don't be scared by the line. It moves quickly, and according to my London friend who has come here before, they grossly overestimate the time you'll spend queuing up to get in to the restaurant. Plus, they give you free fizzy lemonade while you wait. 
The food is exceptional and the service is quite good, too. We got a variety of plates: crispy, spicy okra fries (how have I not had these before?!), yummy garlic naan, tangy chicken tikka, paneer tikka, and the perfectly dressed bowl of greens. You know a restaurant is good when you're savoring every bite of the simply dressed greens. Anyhow, between two ladies, we thought we might have enough food to bring home for leftovers, but after a taxing day of tourist-ing, we happily ate everything in front of us. Consequently, my recommendation is to get a whole bunch of plates and share the food among your party. You'll want to sample everything you see, anyway!
I got the salted caramel khulfee for dessert, which is basically like a salted caramel ice cream pop. It was yummy, and I didn't share it.
Come here! I wish we had Indian food this good and inexpensive where I live.",1
4,"Luckily we made reservations 1 week in advance, and we didn't have to wait in the very long queue . Service was great ,( our waitress Kay was very helpful and nice ) food was good , reasonably priced . Great selection.",1
5,"Dishoom was definitely one of the most delicious highlights of our trip to London. Did I say delicious? 
The ambiance, energy and service were all great
We over-ordered so we could try a bit of everything -Dal, Chicken Tikka, Chicken Ruby, Mango Salad, Veggie Samosa. Everything but the samosa was exemplary. The samosa was just OK but we couldn't really complain. 
The lime-soaked Chicken Ruby was very very very good. We've been home two weeks and we're still talking about it. 
Hoping Dishoom will look to expand to NY. When the day comes, we'll be there!",1
5,"It was a wait of 45 mins to get in. But well worth it. Quick service, very courteous staff and the food - well - brilliant. I had the dishoom chicken tikka, the chicken biryani and chai. The chicken tikka was cooked to perfection and the spices were perfect. 
The bottomless chai - on a cold day - what else could you ask for. All in all - I highly recommend this place. I know for sure I am going back.",1
5,"I went here for brunch with a friend and I had a very tasty meal! I had a regular breakfast dish which was then infused with spicy indian influences. It was surprising and quite unique. Book ahead since there's almost always a queue. Would go back again, yum!",1
5,"I've tried Indian food in London before, but this was amazing. We started off with the vegetable samosas - the pasty was light and fluffy and the filling was so well seasoned. The samosa melted in your mouth. Also ordered the spicy lamb chops, chicken tikka, and on the side - raita, cheddar naan, basmati rice. Everything was cooked so well - meats were tender and juicy but not over or undercooked. Everything flavor packed and complimented each other so well. The waiter was extremely helpful in recommending dishes that should be paired together! Need to come here every time I'm back in London!!!",1
5,"Hands down best Indian I have had outside of India. With a table of four, we tried about 5 small plates, 4 entrees, two desserts, and a few drinks - everything was outstanding. Listen to your server, get the okra fries, and come hungry.
Long waite outside, so make sure to send someone early to queue for a table.",1
4,"This restaurant is impressive, from the decor to the desserts. 
Don't come here to enjoy just one dish, come to share many dishes amongst friends and make sure your try their cocktails. Each restaurant has its own house special - the black lentil dahl in the Covent Garden branch is just delicious. 
I've frequented it plenty of times, there's so many dishes to choose from and they even do the salads well. A hearty, wholesome and incredibly delicious and fresh option for indian cuisine, I've never been disappointed and usually find myself too full to finish what I've ordered in my sheer excitement over the menu (but that's nothing new)
I haven't been before dinner service, but I hear breakfast and brunch is done exceedingly well here and the restaurant works well for any social setting; a date, a relaxed social with friends and on a business level. 
Remember - sharing is caring (& you can order that little bit more!) 
C.x",1
3,"The queue can be a bit long and then they make you wait at the bar for quite a while. Overall the food is good, not excellent. The service is always excellent and food arrived quickly. I would highly recommend the house daal.",-1
4,"We visited Dishoom in Shoreditch shortly after a few games of ping pong in nearby Bounce. The two make for a great combination!
Although the entrance to the restaurant is situated on a Shoreditch backstreet, the decorative interior and ambience makes it feel like you're stepping into a different world. The lights are dimmed, giving a dark and moody atmosphere, even during late afternoon. But not in a gothic way - it has the persona of an imperial Bombay cafe.  There is an outdoor terrace for the warmer summer evenings - however it is not possible to request a booking here - and the centre of the restaurant has a wide open square space fronted by the bar.
The service was excellent and the food was creative and delicate at a reasonable price. The menu allows you to order small plates or a main meal. The grilled lamb kebab and chicken ruby tasted amazing and there was a choice of Indian beers and IPAs.
As can be expected for a restaurant such as this, there was a 40 minute wait for a table. Dishoom keeps back most of their tables for walk-ins. But at least there wasn't a queue halfway down the street - Dishoom allows you to sit at the bar with an electronic bleeper that lets you know when your table is ready.
Would definitely visit again and try some more dishes.",1
5,"This place is EXCELLENT! Long wait, but totally worth it! The customer service is unmatched from the moment you put your name on the list. They're very realistic about wait times and offer cold/ hot beverages while you're waiting. Once in, the customer service continues. Knowledgeable and friendly staff offer recommendations and the vibe is really cool; good music, ambiance, and decor. The food is out of this world and very reasonably priced. 
Would and will go back again! Already recommended it to two friends! 
Ask for Gabri - great server!",1
5,"My dinner at Dishoom was easily one of the best dining experiences of my life. Every aspect of the experience - atmosphere, service, food and drink - was excellent. We went around 7pm a Sunday night on a recent trip to the Covent Garden location, and waited a little over an hour for a table. Do not be deterred by the line outside! The hostesses offer you chai tea and a delicious lime drink while waiting in line, and allow you to wait in the bar area and grab cocktails/appetizers before your table is ready. The restaurant also just smells delicious - the whiff of spices you get as you enter the restaurant is a clear indication that your meal will be transcendent.
We ordered the calamari and vegetable samosas as bar appetizers while we waited for our table. Both were delicious, very nicely flavored! For dinner, we ordered the prawn moilee, spicy lamb chops, bowl of greens, paneer tikka, and each of the naan varieties. We also threw in a black house daal, on recommendation from our fantastic waiter Gabri. My personal standouts were the prawn moilee and lamb chops - both perfectly cooked and just oozed with flavorful goodness.
The general atmosphere was what impressed me most about Dishoom. The food and drink are extremely reasonably priced, especially considering how high quality they are. The hostesses and wait staff have service down to an art - a busy dining environment could very easily be hectic, but they go above and beyond. Thank you to Gabri and the whole Dishoom team for a supremely special and memorable meal!",1
5,"One of my favourite restaurants in London. 
The place is always crowded so I recommend making reservations especially to sit outside they have a lovely garden. 
I've been there before and after going vegan and I was never disappointed by it.
Now my favourites are the potato, okra fries, the bowl of greens ( ohh wow! ), puff rice and a chickpea with rice plate which I don't know the name but I will sure up date it soon as I remember it. 
Dishroom is a perfect place to go for a date or take your family and friends on a special dinner and it's also fun! I love the idea of having small plates and sharing the food. I have been there many times now and I will be back soon for sure.",1
4,"I'm not a big fan of Indian food, but I did enjoy my meal here...the cheese and the garlic  naan were both very good. Unfortunately I'd have to have a menu to give the proper names of the dishes...but the rice and chicken dish was good, rice well cooked and the chicken was nicely seasoned, the lamb samosa was very good...pastry flaky and minced lamb well done, the mint sauce went well with it.  The prawns were well cooked, however because of size I feel they should have been called shrimp...but what do I know about labeling! I have to say the service was excellent, our server was on top of everything, the decor is very nice and the enclosed booths are roomy and provide privacy.  If you like bourbon try the viceroy.",1
5,"A game-changer for budget franchises...it feels so much more expensive than it really is. Went for breakfast- tried the bacon naan roll everyone raves about and I've jumped on the bandwagon. I could eat 3 portions.  Not sure if it's a normal thing but my waitress handed me a free cup of hot chai tea and it was deeeeeeelicious. 
Can't wait to go for dinner.",1
5,"Got the recommendation from a coworker to visit when we are in London. Amazing!
Sit back and enjoy bottomless chai and wonderfully prepared Indian dishes.
Our server Magdalena was awesome, attentive and made sure the our cup of chai was always full
Even when we had extra dhal on the table she offered to get us some side dishes. We politely declined as we were stuffed and ready to retire for the day at 1pm with a nap
Def will be back
You should go at least for the chai!",1
2,"This place does not deserve the ratings displayed by other patrons. I am a globe trotter with a very eclectic palate and have tasted Indian food all over the world. I did not mind the 1 hour wait and in fact appreciated the warm tea they served outside. The only reason I come to an Indian restaurant is to enjoy some good desi food. This place is a huge disappointment! They need to change their chef or teach him how to cook Chicken Tikka Masala(Ruby). It tasted of uncooked tomatoes and the spices were not throughly cooked.The next dish we tried was a biryani and God help us.  It only made me miss the countless other decent biryanis I have had in my life time. 
I think the hype is initial and will die down once the audience finds out other better options!",-1
4,"If you think you know Indian food, try Dishoom. A fun take on the old colonial India with known dishes and old takes on traditional Indian fare. The interior of the Shoreditch branch was wonderful. Black lentils are a must.
Not tried brunch yet, but heard it's a highlight.",1
4,"I've come here twice and loved my experience both times. The first time I came for dinner on a Friday night, and the wait time for our party of 3 was around 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad. After we finished (around 8 pm, I'm guessing), the line was HUGE so I'd recommend getting here earlier rather than later. 
The second time (today) we - a party of 9 - came for lunch and the wait time was just around 15 minutes. I know Dishoom recommends ordering ""family style"" but all of us ordered our own dishes and shared for tastes. I opted for the Chicken Tikka with a side of Garlic Naan, and might I say that I REALLY enjoyed it. The portion size was perfect for me (maybe even a little too much) and I finished all of what I ordered. The spice level was just right, too, especially when paired with the naan. Everyone else in our party also really enjoyed their meal, and we all left happy, satisfied, and in (slight) food comas. 
The environment here is pretty awesome too. It seems really modern and the decor is on point. The staff is also amazing and definitely contributed to my great experience here both times. The minus one star is only because I'm not the biggest fan of Indian food to begin with, but I'm pretty sure this is as good as it gets - or it's the best I've had, at least.",1
5,"This joint serves up very delicious Indian food. I normally don't hunt down Indian food, but since I was in London visiting I had to have some. Out of all the meals I had during my week stay, this was the best meal I had.
The Chicken Ruby, their version of Chicken Tiki Masala, was very tasty. It had a great balance of richness and the chicken was very moist and tender. My favorite by far was the cheesy naan. It was like a naan quesadilla. So good.
The atmosphere is great, buzzing with guests. The portions are perfect for sharing. Make sure you leave yourself time to wait in the que because it is a popular spot, but worth the wait.",1
5,"We stayed in London for 3 days and we came 3 times. Amazing service, flavorful food and a really enjoyable experience. A must-do in this city!",1
4,"We waited in line for about 45 minutes before being seated. It was midday and we heard the wait can be even longer. I'll tell you, it was worth the wait. We were given mint tea while waiting in line and once seated things just got better. Our server was really attentive and made several suggestions. We started with calamari and samosas. We enjoyed this with the chutney and chili sauce. So good!  Then we had the lamb kabob, black daal, and chicken ruby, cheese naan and basmati rice. What a treat!!! We also had chai and chocolate pudding to end our meal. This exceeded my expectations and I can only hope to find a gem like this when we get back home to NY",1
4,"Good food, great ambience and friendly service. Dishoom is a really good choice for those who enjoy spicy food. I thought it was good but definetely not the best Indian food I had in my life.",1
5,"Is it the most authentic Indian food?  I don't know.  Was it tasty?  Heck yes!  My friend told me I must visit Dishoom when in London, and I'm so glad I did!  We were in London for 7 days over Christmas, and Dishoom decided to close on the 2 days that we were available to venture out to shop and eat :(  so we had to purposely go out of our way on our last day in London, and squeeze in a light lunch, right before our afternoon tea time (which was a total waste of money...anyway, that's a different story and review!).  Yes, the wait sucked, but it wasn't horrible.  The lady with the iPad was very friendly, and informed us right from the start that the wait would be an hour long.  I think the actual time was maybe 40 minutes?  At the very least, we didn't have to wait in the rain (since we all know how fickle London weather can be...).  Plus, the heater was on and there was unlimited Chai being served while we waited. And I don't even like Chai!  I hate cinnamon and I avoid Chai like the plague.  But I gave it a try since they were handing them out, and I was cold.  And boy was I glad I tried it...it hit just the right spot in the freezing weather, and I went back for 4 more glasses.  If it weren't because we had afternoon tea afterwards, I would've gotten a Chai for takeaway at the end of our meal. 
On to the food...it was only my husband and I, so we couldn't order too much food / carb knowing that we were having afternoon tea within a couple hours.  We had lamb samosas, roti, chicken ruby, and chicken tikka (a dry dish, but the meat was cooked perfectly and so tender).  And all were delicious!  I especially loved the sauce in the chicken ruby, it went perfectly with the roti.  For next time, I definitely want to re-order the chicken ruby, but also try the biryani and rice.  And can't forget the Chai......mmmmm.",1
5,"We went here for a late lunch around (1pm) on a Monday and were seated immediately. Every other day we walked passed Dishoom, there was a line out the door. The hostess told us that they only take reservations for dinner if the party is more than 6 people. Furthermore, the entire staff was extreme pleasant and helpful.
The atmosphere of Dishoom is exactly what I would expect for a Bombay style cafe in London. The decor creates the feeling of a small cafe from an exotic land. The downstairs area has extra tables and a bar.
 
We started with the House Black Daal (~5 £) and garlic naan (~2 £). The garlic naan was only two halves, which is slightly less than we expected, but the House Black Daal was amazing. It is a cream lentil based sauce that could honestly be a soup and a meal by itself. The spices were perfectly balanced to offer flavor, but was mild enough for even the most spice-adverse individuals. We also split an order of Okra Fries (~4 £). These were good and crispy, but nothing compared to the House Black Daal.
For our meals, I got the Biryani Awadhi Lamb (~10  £). The server suggested also getting an order of Raita (~2 £), a yogurt dish similar to Tzatziki sauce, to act as a palate cleanser to reduce the amount of heat from the Awadhi Lamb. The Awadhi Lamb is a bowl of rice, onions, other toppings, and tender lamb. The lamb actually pulled apart similar with just my fork. As someone that loves food in sauces, I used the remaining House Black Daal and poured it over the rice. The Raita was definitely a nice touch, as the Awadhi Lamb had a subtle spice that got hotter in my mouth as I continued to eat. 
My friend ordered the Chicken Rubi (~10  £) and a side of Roti bread (~2  £). Her chicken was extremely moist and tender and was smothered in a bowl of ruby red curry sauce. I didn't have much, but she was thoroughly pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone that like Butter Chicken or Chicken Tikka Malasa.
I was already stuffed so for dessert I only ordered the Chocolate Chai Tea (~3 £). It tasted like a lightly sweetened hot chocolate with the subtle spice of chai tea. The topping was similar to an extremely light frothy steamed milked with cinnamon sprinkled on top. Definitely a must get on an colder day. 
My friend ordered the Pineapple and Black Pepper Crumble (~5  £). It is served on this little wooden tray with the vanilla sauce on the side. I thought it was going to be overly sweet from the look of it, but I was surprised by its subtle sweetness that allowed the perfectly ripe pineapple to provide the flavor. 
Overall, Dishoom offer great indian food for reasonable prices. With it located near the center of London, its a great option for anyone. Also, on Mondays they play this ""game"" when you get your bill. You roll a die and if it lands on 6 your bill is covered by the restaurant! Just another incentive if the amazing food was not enough.",1
5,"Best indian food i have had thus far. They serve sherry and chai when you wait in the cue outside. Despite the wait being near one hour, the food was well worth it. We began with calamari, garlic naan and black daal which was simmered perfectly. Next, we ordered the spicy lamb chops and they were cooked to perfection. I sill have the taste of the Masala prawns in my mouth and I certainly do not mind. Paneer tikka was very flavorful and cooked to perfection. This is my new London spot for indian! The portions of the naan and roti are quite small so you may need a few orders depending on varying level of hunger. Well worth a try!",1
5,"Best Indian restaurant we've ever been to. The service was excellent, ambiance was great (the bar downstairs is perfect for drinks and dining), and most importantly the food was incredible! (Note: I probably butchered some spellings in this review- too busy to fact check).
First, we waited 1 hour at 9pm on Saturday night. If you're not prepared to wait for good food in a major city, then don't-- but don't blame the restaurant!
We ordered the lamb kebabs, chicken ruby, house black dahl, garlic naan bread, raita, and the mahi curry. It was all excellent, we'd order it all again. The okra fries were just ok- way too salty for our tastes though the dips were nice.The portions are fairly small, so order plenty of dishes and share nibbles amongst the table. Also they don't custom prepare dishes in terms of spice, so my wife found some dishes uncomfortably spicy, but it's Indian after all so can't complain about that. 
For drinks their house IPA is excellent and my wife really enjoyed the Bolly-Bellini.",1
5,"I highly recommend this place.  I had to try Indian food in London and it was amazing.  We had the Chicken Ruby, Jackfruit, Lamb Boti Kabab and so much more.  Plates are small enough that you can order a bunch and share.  Great experience over all.  It was worth the 1 hour wait to be seated.",1
3,"Really busy restaurant. We manage to go one afternoon and we didn't need to queue. Indian food, but I wouldn't define it very authentic, small portions too and not very cheap, however, it is a very trendy place so I guess you pay for that.",-1
5,Great Indian fusion restaurant. All their circled items are awesome and very tasty. The service is also great.,1
5,"absolutely cannot fault it. It's so good, i go there regularly (we're talking once a month, at least). they have a wonderful variety of the most delicious dished. 
I would very highly recommend the black house dhal. it's so good, i want to put my face in it. 
the fish is very nice too. house chai is a winner - and if you're after a dessert, go for the pineapple crumble but swap the custard for cinnamon and/or chilli ice cream. you will not regret it",1
5,"This place runs like a well oiled machine. Even with an hour wait they have it set up so the time goes by quickly and you're not just standing and waiting. After waiting outside we were escorted downstairs to the bar area to wait in comfort for our table. We enjoyed a nice cocktail and snack, and before we knew it our table was ready. The wait staff was awesome helping us sift through the menu and making the right choices. EVERYTHING we had was delicious. The garlic naan, roti, chicken tikka, lamb...it was all perfect. We enjoyed our dinner so much that we returned two days later for a late lunch. That's saying something considering all the restaurant choices in the area.",1
5,Dishoom is di-licious. Go and see for yourself. You'll be glad you did. Food is incredible and service is so good. Highly recommend.,1
5,"Spectacular! This location was large and elaborately decorated to mimic the Bombay Irani cafes of the early 1900s. From the tables and chairs, to the wall decor and bar setup, entering this restaurant is as if you had entered a time capsule back to early twentieth century India. The menu is presented tapas style, and every dish I tired I thoroughly enjoyed! We started with the masala prawns (very large, exquisitely seasoned prawns!) and the lamb samosas (very light filo with tender pieces of lamb). Next we shared the Awadhi Lamb (again, a wonderful seasoned biryani dish) and ordered a side of Roomali Roti (this was our only disappointment, since the roti seemed a bit tough). The Dishoom Chicken Tikka Roll was also  very flavorful, and enough to share for 2! For dessert, try the Pineapple and Black Pepper Crumble - not too sweet and a perfect end to the meal.  The waiter was attentive, and service flawless. I only wish I lived in London to sample more of their menu! This is a restaurant you want to keep coming back to for its sheer uniqueness and top notch service!",1
4,"Writing this review several months after eating here because I'd forgotten the name of the place - oops!
Great food, friendly service. Lovely atmosphere. 
Small complaint - it took a very long time for the waitstaff to give us menus, and then to take our order. I'm American and I don't know if this is standard in London, or if we just went unnoticed.",1
3,"The server was awesome and the atmosphere was great! Really tough to find something I could eat with gluten, dairy and soy allergies though. I also don't like spicy foods, so I really couldn't eat the one dish I ordered. This place isn't a good restaurant for me, but seems like it could be good for others.",-1
5,"Delicious black daal, buttered naan, okra fries, roti and ruby chicken. Great prices and worth the wait. I'll definitely return.",1
5,"I loved this place, went on a late Saturday evening and had the best and only Mango Lassi with Rum!!  Loved it! Food is very tasty and ideal for sharing and enjoy friends. I wouldn't suggest it for big groups as sharing become trickier and that's the best about it. 
We found it also quite a bargain as we spent less than £50 in three of us, drinks included!",1
4,"I'd say this place is a bit over-hyped, but does serve very delicious Indian food. Came here with a group of 10 for a work outing. Total price was about £50 a head and we were well fed and well hydrated. I'd recommend the samosas (lamb or veggie), chili cheese toast, chicken tikka from the grill, okra fries, and masala prawns. Didn't think the black daal was particularly memorable - tasted a bit watery! 
My wife isn't too keen on Indian food, but I think she'd find some dishes to try here - it's not too exotic.",1
5,"I really like Dishoom.  The food is really good, the drinks are tasty, the staff are great, it's well run, and the room is kitschy and fun.  I don't know if I like 60% of the menu items but the ruby chicken, breads, veggie curry, samosas and a few other little things are great - oh yah, the okra is pretty good.
Don't order that desert they say tastes strange - it really is gross.",1
5,"Hands-down, the BEST food we've ever had in London! We liked it so much that we went back 2 nights in a row. Here's our breakdown:
SERVICE: SO great! We waited in line outside, about 45 minutes each night and both nights were impressed with the service. The hostess came around while we were in line outside with different drinks for all of us patiently waiting. We got mint tea, sherry, and chai tea. Everyone we interacted with was super nice and gave great recommendations for the food. The servers and hostesses just seemed very gracious in our waiting in line and were all very kind in demeanor. 
FOOD: Freakin' delicious! Actual flavor CAN be found in London! Here's what we tried over our 2 nights here:
-Far Far: light and yummy snack chips that are fun and colorful and went great with the 3 sauces they bring to the table!
-Chili Cheese Toast: a nice twist to regular toast with a little kick of spice mixed in with cheese. Very tasty!
-Okra Fries: We had never tried okra and these were delicious all nice and fried
-Pau Bhaji: tasty vegetable mash good to be swapped up with bread, but our least favorite dish.
-Keema Pau: VERY good lamp/pea mashup also served with bread that comes so full of flavor your mouth is just in awe, but then you squirt some lemon on it and BOOM; you can't even believe it's better.
-Murgh Malai: Super tender and flavorful chicken!!
-Dishoom Chicken Tikka: another very tender and flavorful chicken in a happy mix of spices
-Gunpowder Potatoes: good and a large amount we couldn't even finish it. Great white sauce that is served with them go well with pretty much anything else you order as well.
-Spicy Lamb Chops: Very tender and delicious and accented marvelously by pomegranates. So good it almost tasted like beef!
-Masala Prawns: Such delicious and plump shrimp in great flavor and comes even more to life with lime too.
-Garlic Naan: Good solid naan; can't go wrong.
-Dishoom Chocolate Pudding: Good but a little weird because it has chili in the chocolate but not terrible. I personally wouldn't order it again. Chocolate is very moist and rich.
-Pistachio Kulfi: One of the best ice cream popsicles I've ever had. It's like super creamy condensed milk with a light pistachio flavor; perfect!
All in all, come here and stuff your face. Will be our #1 spot to go to when in London!",1
5,"Everything about this place is a resounding yes, from the moment we started lining up out front to the last bite of dessert.
We arrived at 6pm and there was already a 1hr wait. However this was overestimated for us since a few tables before us left.  The wait starts outside where we were served water and house chai as we waited in line.  After 25min, we were given a buzzer and was told we could continue our wait at the bar downstairs.  I ordered a mango Lassi as we waited another 15 for our table.  Highly recommend the mango lassi.
Once we sat down, we ordered the pau bhaji for apps; black house daal, ruby chicken, chicken biryani, and Naan for entrees; and finished with the pistachio kulfi and gola ice for dessert.  
Pau Bhaji - seasoned mashed veggies with two buttered buns.  I know what you're thinking, that mashed veggies sound a lot like gerber's baby food, but this was on a whole nother spectrum.  It's all spiced up and tastes like dense curry that's spreadable on the buns.  Delicious - it reminds me of the the street food of Mumbai, except I wasn't afraid of getting food poisoning this time around.
Ruby Chicken -  think chicken tikki masala or murgh makhani, it's the red based curry with grilled chicken chunks.  Everyone raves about this dish and for good reason, it was the clear winner of our table too; silky smooth sauce with perfectly tender chicken.  I wish we ordered this twice.
Black House Daal - lentils and/or beans that are boiled overnight, it's a cream like dish with soft lentils/beans (although I think Dishoom only used lentils).  We could have skipped this.  I was lured in by other reviews, but for us, it tasted like beans cooked in butter and we wished we ordered something else. 
Chicken Biryani - seasoned rice dish that is normally cooked in a clay pot, it's like the fried rice of Indian food.  We loved this dish as well, the chicken was succulent and the we didn't have to order a side rice since there was plenty in this dish.  We dipped the chicken in our remaining ruby sauce and ate the rice with our other plates.
Pistachio Kulfi - creamy frozen yogurt that is magical.  Leave room for one of these!
Kala Khatta Gola Ice - this is a really bizarre frozen ice dessert.  It's a snowcone with the weirdest syrup you'll ever have.  I really enjoyed it because it reminds me of salted plum drinks my mom used to make me, so if that doesn't sound appetizing, I would avoid it.  My fiancee thought it was WAY too salty, but I grew up with the flavors and highly enjoyed it.   It's salty, sour, tangy, and peppery.  
Overall we are incredibly satisfied we made this our Indian place to go to in London.  The wait was worth it!",1
4,"Dishoom is a tribute to Hindi movies made in the Mumbai (Bombay) film industry also known as Bollywood. Dishoom is actually the sound effect one heard during the fight scenes in old Bollywood films when the good 'uns and the baddies used to punch each other to oblivion (or until the very competent police finally arrived).
We were booked at Dishoom for NYE dinner by my wife's uncle and aunt. We were told that on any other day you need to queue up (even upto 45 minutes), just to get in and then you wait again to be seated at a table (another 45 minutes, possibly).
Given the occasion, there was a set menu, one each for vegetarians and meat eaters. The menu I've uploaded is the meat one.
On arrival we were given a glass of complementary prosecco each. Starters were based on traditional Bombay street food. We had pav bhaji (spicy-tangy potato based curry  with buns), the meat version with mince lamb, paneer tikka, fried okras and grilled prawns.
The mains consisted of chicken biryani, vegetable biryani as the rice dishes. These appeared to be dum biryanis. The dum pukht method of cooking biryanis is one in which the rice and meat/vegetable are layered with each other in a pot and slow cooked. Before cooking, however, the pot is tightly sealed in order to retain the aromas.
In addition to the biryanis, we also had naan breads and rumali rotis. Rumal, in hindi means a very thin handkerchief. Rumali rotis are made that thin and it takes a lot of skill to make these by hand.
We also had dal makhanis (black gram cooked in a creamy sauce) and malai koftas (deep fried vegetable-cheese balls in a creamy sauce).
Oh, before I forget, we also had tandoori grilled lamb on the bone.
All the mains were very, very well prepared and presented, but the chicken biryani, I felt lacked that spicy grunt, which one expects in a dum biryani.
For dessert we had what they called a Gujju chocolate mousse. Gujju is the friendly slag term we Indians use for Gujaratis, who, by the way make some amazing sweets and desserts. The mousse, however was a big disappointment as it didn't feel very gujju.
We also had masala chai (traditional north indian tea with ginger, cardamom and spices, with a hint of sugar). The chai was fantastic!
I am allergic to things that swim. Fish, prawns, mussels, shell fish, you name it. Since some of the dishes on the meat menu were fish based the restaurant offered me a veggie menu and very kindly told me they won't charge extra for any meat dishes I may want to order from the set menu, especially given that the set menu was priced around £50 per person. This, I felt was a great gesture on their part.
However only 4 stars this time as the chicken biryani did not feel up to scratch and the chocolate mousse didn't feel very Gujju at all.
I enjoyed the experience of dining at Dishoom and thoroughly recommend it.
As with everywhere else, I hope they maintain their quality of cooking and levels of service.",1
5,"I have fallen in love with Dishoom. They might have exploded in number of stores, and it may look a little too popular indeed, but the design and decor is very beautiful - and so are the foods. It's both beautiful and delicious. Very delicious actually. I can't say anything bad actually.
The house chai was extremely rich, intense and tasty - oh, and it is bottomless too. My breakfast lassi was freshly prepared with a cold and creamy consistency. Spot on.
Finally my house granola was delicious also. The housemade granola was crunchy and buttery, while the vanilla yoghurt tasted good too. Fresh fruit was actually - and always surprisingly - fresh and sweet.
I can't wait to come back. Both for other breakfasts, but also to try the lunch and dinner.",1
4,"The freshest indian food i have ever eaten. its got a real streetr food feel to it and the buzz inside is great.
only down fall is you quite often have to queue to get in and the service can sometimes be slow because its so busy. everyone who works there seems very happy and smiles are everywhere!
Would highly reccomend!",1
3,"Contrary to what the endless queues outside this place would have you believe, this place is ordinary and far from extraordinary. I think this restaurant is so overrated. Not because it's bad, but because it tastes pretty much like any other fairly good Indian restaurant but with slightly bumped up prices and long lines outside. 
I didn't find that this restaurant offered anything particularly spectacular or different, which makes me wonder why it has become such a sought-after restaurant. The service is fine, the food is fine, the decor is fine, but that's just it, fine.",-1
5,This continues to be my favorite place to get amazing Indian street food. Always busy (for a reason!); keema paav is to die for..,1
5,"Dishoom serves Indian unlike any you've had before, and it's absolutely fantastic. Forget the heavy handed kormas, curries and oily naans etc. Dishoom does Indian food justice and does it damned good! 
I've been here for both breakfast and dinner, and they're among some of the best you can get in London. If you can book in advance, DO IT, because the queues here can get ridiculously long with several hour waits if you're really that keen. 
But is it worth it? Yes. £5/6 for an absolutely incredible bacon or naan roll? £2.50 for bottomless chai? Brunch sorted for under £10, and get a stamp on a loyalty card giving you free brunch after only 5 stamps!
Dinner wise? Go with a bunch of mates and just order everything on the menu, you won't be disappointed. Personal favourites are the pau buns - so soft and buttery! 
Definitely a highlight of the London dining scene for me, and has even converted some of my curry hating friends to the light!",1
5,"This place is sooo good that I waited in line for over an hour and half twice. The wait is worth it. We try so many things from the menu that I can't remember their names, but all were very good. Do not let the long line turn you away, you will love this place.",1
2,"London needs to sort it's self out. Falling arse over tit about dishoom. 
The food is pretty good, admittedly, I can't fault it, there are better Indians in London (lots) and cheaper, but you're not here for the food, you're here for the decor (be honest with yourself on this one if you're currently disagreeing) which is brilliant, really well thought out, and the place has a great ambiance, if you were to walk in, get a table and eat, it would be 4 stars straight away. Even a half hour wait at the bar would be fine. But who the fuck are you kidding when you're expected the queue outside to get in to the bar to wait 2 HOURS for a table. Are they having a fucking laugh? 
There are seemingly a lot of idiots willing to do this. 
There are far too many good restaurants in London to justify that wait ever. Let alone at 5pm on a Sunday. 
On top of this the bar is pretty poor, the cocktails are all done on theme, and most favour throwing in overpowering flavours for the sake of sounding exotic. Classics are neglected, the negroni was pretty lacklustre and pointlessly on some different teir of cocktails that you pour yourself (thanks, my own bottle!) if you're going to make people wait in your bar for 2 hours, make it a decent bar.",-1
5,Awesome food. Had to wait for 1 hour to get a table but the wait was worth each and every minute. Dal is one of the best I had in long time.,1
5,"Dishoom was a great experience for dinner for my wife and I.
We practically LOVED everything that was served to us!!
We were lucky enough that we arrived and the wait for 2 was not that long.  We wanted to have Indian the night before, but we were a party of 9 and when we got there, there was a line that spun around the front windows.  So we opted out that evening.  So glad that we made it back.
The cocktails were expertly crafted and perfectly blended.  The bartenders downstairs struck up a convo and asked what were we looking for to satisfy our palate and sip on while we waited for our table.  The drinks were excellent and definitely went well with dinner also.
The Black Daal- I believe this was the special, but it had a wonderful taste.  The black lentils were simmered and seasoned extremely well.  You can taste every spice blended into the daal.  
Kacchi Lamb- This rice dice is enough for one and will satisfy your hunger.  But why order one when you can order many.  Large chunks of tender lamb meat, tasted very good, spiced well, and layered with rice on top.  Very well executed.
Lamb Boti Kabab-  Tender pieces of lamb, grilled, garlicky and gingery, but not overwhelming.  Served with a couple of wedges of limes that when topped, it definitely brought out the taste of the meat.  It was so well seasoned that even in the center of the bite, you can taste the seasonings.
Chicken Ruby- Tasty curry with dark meat chicken, slight sweetness to it that went well as a dipper for the naan.  Or I mean...the soaker...Soaked up all the goodness with the naan.
Raita- The yogurt sauce was served plentiful.  Good consistency and a good balance for every plate.
Naan- Warm, chewy and great for dipping!
Can't say enough good things about Dishoom.  It definitely enhances every aspect of your mouth and it was so delicious, we practically cleaned up every plate with the last piece of naan.  Wish there was a Dishoom back at home...I'd be a frequent flyer.",1
4,"Definitely one of the more unique Indian restaurants I've been to. London obviously has it's fair share of great Indian places, but this one had something that stood out. The dishes were a lot less sauce-y than more typical Indian restaurants I've been to. 
The standout on the menu for me was the Dishoom calamari, which was absolutely amazing. Black house daal and the chicken berry brittania biryani were good as well. The garlic naan was a bit butterier than I would have preferred, but that's just a personal preference. 
The restaurant is obviously very popular and we went waited for about 45-60 minutes for a table on a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm. No complaints though-it was worth the wait.",1
2,"Very popular place and we loved the fast service, really fast!! However, the food lacked authenticity and we have had much better Indian food elsewhere. Next time in London we'll try someplace else.",-1
5,"Fantastic flavours! Had the recommended Dal makhni, the chana bhatura and the amazing pista kulfi (because of which we walked in, in the first place). And of course my lassi. Loved the food, it was fresh, looked fantastic. We actually loved it so much that I had to go back to this place the next day. We tried the one in Covent Garden this time and again the food was great. We got biryani and vada pav, both tasting authentic. The pickled mirchi which came with the chana was outstanding. The lines were really long and the service was a bit slow but overall, good experience. Definitely try it out!",1
4,"Amazing modern Indian cuisine.
Decor is very atmospheric, dim lighting make you feel like you're somewhere that has its pulse on the London trends.
The food is creative and absolutely delicious. The black dahl is a MUST as are the gunpowder potatoes.
I hear the cocktails are great, though haven't tried them myself.
If you like coke and want something similar you wont find anywhere else in London then buy a thumbs up. Think masala cola...???...
The only reason that this place doesn't get 5* is the disappointing lack of vegetarian mains. I really wanted to give Dishoom  5* but there just aren't that many options. 
The veggy mains I've tried didn't rock my world. The Tikka Panneer was dry and rubbery. Very sad. Ah well, if you stay away from that it's all delicious! 
I would certainly recommend Dishoom to a friend. A really great, interesting and not too expensive place to eat. Just tell them if they're veggy to stick to the small dishes.",1
5,"Forgot to write this when I was in London.  Some business colleagues recommended this place for great Indian food...they were right.  OMG!  I love flavorful, spicy, but not over-spiced Indian food.  Service was spot on and my curry was perfect!  I will be back when I fly across the pond next time!  Sorry no pics this time, but I'll post on my next visit.  Cheers mates!",1
5,"Best Indian Food I have ever had. I said that 2 times in my life so far, and it is very likely that this is the last time I will say it. Not only is food from out of this world, the service is incredible. I had this establishment on my list of places to visit, but could never circumvent the never ending line in front of the door, sometimes with people waiting in the rain around the corner, just for a chance to dine at Dishroom. This time, I stumbled upon it while walking through Covent Garden and - there was no line. No line means no-brainer. I had to get in. Still a 30 min wait, which was made quite pleasurable with their underground bar. 15 mins in and my table was ready. Oh boy...what a feast, and what a party in my mind and soul. Lamb samosas and to start are a great way to ease you into what's coming. Their roasted veggie spread on a pretzel bun - are simply incredible. That might be the very best appetizer I have ever had. Amazing. Of course, I didn't stop there, Lamb kabob, black daal, basmati rice, garlic naan, and dish room chicken tikka blew me away. The perfect blend of tastes unlike any other i've experienced. 
Staff - best service I've seen in London. Tickles my friendly, sunny American expectations that everyone should smile all the time and make you feel welcome and valued.
Hats down to Dishroom.",1
5,"I had my first trip to Dishoom last week after hearing numerous glowing reviews and, I have to say, I was totally blown away. 
The whole experience was fantastic. Excellent service (despite it being the pre theatre crush) and wonderful food made it a memorable trip. 
Everything that we ate was delicious but the Black Daal, one of the house specials, was a rich and sumptuous delight that really stood out. The Pau Bhaji is also highly recommended. 
The quality of the food means that I am keen to get back to London asap to continue exploring the menu.",1
5,Amazing. Waited for 45 minutes during mid day lunch... And worth every second. Super tasty ruby murray curry.... which for Americans and Canadians is your typical red butter chicken curry you normally get... but this is So much better. Stuffed to the max with some nan bread and rice. Would come back and wait in a heart beat.,1
5,This is our go to place for Indian in London -- the city with plenty of super Indian restaurants. Choose from among the many small dishes. Service is always crisp and attentive. But the real start of the show is the food.,1
3,"After multiple friends recommended Dishoom to me as the best Indian restaurant in all of London... I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. I expected to have my mind completely blown, never to be satisfied by the masses of mediocre Indian fare again. Suffice it to say that my expectations were a wee bit too high.
Although even the cabbies said that London has the best Indian food in all the world - better even than India herself... meh. I've honestly had better. 
The menu is definitely interesting with some fusion and inventive options. I think I would've liked more flavor though in all the dishes I had there.  
I bumped off a star for being underwhelmed, but still a great meal can be had here.",-1
5,One of the best Indian food I've had. Showed up around 3:30 pm with a party of 4 and was seated within 5 minutes. Great and attentive service staff. Everyone loved their food and we all had to order extra roti to finish off the sauce. Can't say enough nice things!,1
3,"Food was alright, nothing to brag about.  Portions are very small in comparison to the prices.",-1
4,"Having never tried Indian cuisine before, I wasn't sure what to expect when going to Dishoom, and perhaps a bit nervous. It became clear quickly that it is a very popular spot in London, with over an hour wait for a table. Good sign then, if people are lining up out the door, it must be good. The hostess offered chai tea to us while we stood outside freezing, which was a nice touch. The inside is casual and cozy but vibrant as well. I went with friends who have been before, so I basically tried everything they ordered in a family style sort of set up. The food definitely exceeded my expectations, it was delicious! I tried several things, from vegetable samosas to chicken tikka, and I was pleasantly surprised with it all. I didn't think I would be one for Indian food, considering the heavy emphasis on spices, but it was all very flavorful. It might not be my first choice in cuisine for London, but it was certainly enjoyable no less.",1
5,"Wow, what an awesome restaurant that completely lived up the hype. I heard about this place from some locals that recommended the Indian fusion food here. As an Indian person I was skeptical, but I'm so happy I went. The food was delicious, with some really unique twists such as blueberry biryani, and overall we really enjoyed our meal.
One of the best parts was the plates, each of which are unique with the story of an immigrant from South Asia and their perspective on living in London in the 20th century. Very cool!",1
5,"Go for a late lunch for little to no wait, great drinks! Surprisingly affordable for the quality of food. Great portions, not too spicy but lamb vindaloo and bhel starter had a ton of flavor. Get the kulfi, mango was excellent and authentic.",1
4,"I looove a good Indian place and when my friend told me that London is the place to go for the best Indian restaurant, I was all down for it. This place gets extremely packed and will get a crazy lane if you go too late, so we made sure to get there by 5:30pm and got seated quickly. 
I think we pretty much ordered the whole menu since it was like a tapas style where the dishes come out pretty small but packed with so much flavor. I think I may have just about every veggie dish on the menu plus the calamari and they did not disappoint. The mango lassi was also very good. My tummy definitely left the place pretty satisfied, that's for sure. 
Our waiter and the service there was great and I will definitely come back if I'm ever in London again!",1
5,"Best Indian food... YUM.  The U.K. is famous for having good Indian food, and this place delivers.  Yay!  Ambiance is fun and hip, the crowd watching is interesting, and the delicious food makes all of it just perfect.  We got so many dishes to sample but I wanted more.  I want to fly back to London to try more things here... Go and Enjoy!",1
4,"I highly recommend the Okra Fries from the all day menu, they're incredibly delicious. I had the Black House Daal which was quite good, but I wanted it to have more of a kick as it was a cold day and I wanted the spices to warm me up from the inside. 
Apparently on Mondays they do this thing where if you roll a six the meal is free, but I think they use a trick dice as the waitress demonstrated it twice and it landed on two and when I rolled it also landed on two, so I wonder if it's just a gimmick.",1
4,"I've been before and love this place. Great, REAL Indian food, and I'm Indian! 
My main piece of advice is to go at an off-peak time and avoid the rush. 
I am a bit bummed to see a reduction in their vegetarian options since I was last here in 2013, though :/ Hope they bring these back!",1
5,Crazy energy here! Food was amazing! Can't wait to go back!,1
5,"My hotel was about a block away and coming back from sightseeing, we realized we forgot to make reservations..It was a Saturday night and there was a long line out the door. For a table of two, they told us the wait was going to be an hour but we were starving so we ended up eating elsewhere. Definitely make reservations people! 
We then decided to come here for breakfast Tuesday morning before we left for the airport and boy was that such a great idea!! No lines, service was quick, waitresses were very sweet and accommodating. The interior was very warm and welcoming and the pictures on the wall gave off a Bollywood feel. Our cups of House Chai was never empty. Yes - they have bottomless chai and it was the best chai I've ever tasted. Onto the food..
- Bacon Naan Roll 5.20£ : my goodness, the naan was so good, the bacon was smokey and delicious, and I was just addicted to their chili tomato jam they put in the roll. Can I bring a jar of it home? 
- Big Bombay (akuri, char-striped smoked streaky bacon from The Ginger Pig, peppery Shropshire pork sausages, masala baked beans, grilled field mushroom, grilled tomato and buttered pau buns) 11.50£: it was essentially a little bit of everything from the cooked breakfast menu. Everything on the plate was so delectable. We finished the whole plate and didn't even leave a single drop of sauce on the plate. 
Fantastic prices, bottomless chai, outstanding service. I wish I had come here sooner! If I am back in London, I will definitely be stopping by here again.  My mouth is watering just writing about this review. Highly recommended!!",1
5,"My husband and I were visiting from the States and used Yelp to find this place on a day we were out exploring the city. 
IT WAS AMAZING. Maybe the best meal we had during our entire 2 week trip through the UK and Ireland. We ordered the chicken ruby, chicken tikka, bowl of greens, daal, and naan on the side, washed down with Kingfisher (not a beer commonly seen in AZ). Everything was incredibly flavorful and delicious. The chicken was tender and seasoned perfectly. We both left this meal telling each other we could eat it every day.
Wait staff was attentive and pleasant, and the atmosphere was modern and gorgeous. Definitely a must try.",1
5,"Food was good and service was excellent.  This place is always packed, we were able to get in for late lunch.",1
4,"Street food Indian style you ask? Of course you say!  Different from the typical gee filled cooking from traditional cooking this place is right up my alley with little plays encouraging got to order many to share with friends or even on a cute little date! 
Sometimes there is a queue but that's the fun of it!",1
5,"I'd heard that London had amazing Indian food, but nothing prepared me for Dishoom. I knew I had to try it when there was a line to get in every time I walked past all throughout the weekend, even at off hours like 3pm Saturday. 
Must-orders:
- ruby chicken
- pau bhaji
- roomali roti
But my boyfriend and I tried at least 7-10 different menu items in the two times we ate there and all of them were great. The dishes run just a tad sweeter than your typical Indian fare (at least in NYC), but nothing is one-note or overdone, just super flavorful. Plus on Mondays they let you roll the dice at the end of your meal to get everything for FREE! We didn't win, but a couple of tables around us did - such a cool idea! 
The establishment is also crazy well run with seemingly everyone on staff in constant communication with each other via headsets. When the line is especially long outside, they bring out cups of hot tea to tide you over. The wait time estimate includes the last 15-20 minutes which are spent inside at the cozy bar downstairs, where you can get started on drinks. 
For the quality of food, atmosphere, and service, I expected higher prices. I've recommended it to everyone since coming back to the States.",1
5,"D' ya like Indian food?
Come here!
Looking for flavors that delight and bring joy to your body?
You must come here!
Came here for breakfast and the menu was amazing, so many great dishes on offer. How many breakfast dishes can I order and not waste too much food, I wonder, as I read the menu from top to bottom, and learned quite a bit, actually.
The last time I was in Mumbai (Bombay) I had a wonderful dish for breakfast, and here it was on the menu at Dishoom: Kejriwal- Imagine slices of bread covered in herbal/mustard cheese topped with a poached egg, the softness of the bread soaking up the egg yolk, the fat from the cheese, the rich taste of mustard, all of it swirling in your mouth and on your palate...so comforting, so unique.
Needless to say, this meal led to another the next afternoon, where we sat downstairs near a heaving bar. 
Another amazing meal, the two of us just short of stuffed to the max.
Wanna try something really strange, and strangely tasty?
Kala Khatta Gola Ice
All I can say is what an amazing melange of tastes in one rather simple appearing dish, it's just chipped ice with a few blueberries, right?
Oh hella no, order it and find out!
5+ stars!
As our former Governor Arnold said~ I'll be back!
Enjoy!",1
3,"I'd heard a lot about Dishoom, and so really wanted to try it. After not being able to get in the night before, we made a reservation and got a table to following day.
I guess the problem is that we went to India last year and so our expectations may have increased quite a bit for Indian food. We started with the samosas, and frankly they could have come from absolutely anywhere. The thing that improved them was the chutneys.
The tamarind chutney in particular took me right back to my time in India. I was also pleased to see that the naan we order arrived in the exact same manner, style and taste as we had in India. But what is with all those people ordering it without butter? Seriously people - it'll be much better with!!
We had both the paneer and the chicken tikka. I preferred the paneer but it was a little under seasoned for me - but the texture showed that it was super fresh. The chicken tikka... Well I could tell it had been made properly - no red food dye in sight. But it was a bit bland - I needed to spice all of it up with the chutneys.
I'd come back to Dishoom, as I've read enough solid reviews to make me think that we just ordered badly. I must say that the staff for the most part are excellent.",-1
3,"I really wanted to love Dishoom...
I'd actually call it a 3.5, if I could. We tried to go at 5.30pm on a Wednesday, before a movie premiere, but were told there was a half an hour wait. We were told then too that you can make reservations up until 6pm so we decided to leave it and come back the next day, ahead of yet another movie premiere, with a reservation.
So the next day we turned up at 5pm and the place was busy but not full. Since it was so early for dinner, we just had a few things. We shared some lamb samosas, and I had paneer tikka, and my husband had chicken tikka. We also shared a garlic naan.
The samosas had a good taste, and went well with the lovely chutneys, but judging by the slight softness and the speed, they were not fried to order.
My paneer tikka was fine, but the paneer was a bit bland and the spice paste just didn't really stick to it well so it was mainly plain paneer. I love paneer so it wasn't a total lost cause, but it took a fair bit of the chili chutney to make it tasty. The bread was the highlight, fresh and just like we had in India. We spent most of our time watching the man making the bread at the tandoor, as we were sat next to it.
I didn't have any of the chicken tikka, as it was thigh meat and had skin - just not my thing.
It was pretty expensive for what we had - it came to around £30, with our drinks (a Limca and a Thums Up). I think I'll try it again, but I'm not running back.",-1
4,"Our server was very helpful. Great to go with 4 people and try new dishes to share. Everything we had was great, vegetarian somosas, ruby chicken, spicy lamb chops, chicken tikka and naan. Only downside is given how popular it is the wait can be unreal.",1
5,This is my favorite Indian restaurant in London. There's a long line but if your party of two it's not that bad. It's very clean inside and the service is great. The food is amazing especially their lamb dish. I visit London about 6 times a year and visit here every time. Also Punjab restaurant nearby is excellent.,1
5,"The best Indian food I have ever had! 
I was visiting London with my boyfriend. We came for a late dinner in Sunday, the staff graciously sat us even though the kitchen was closing in five minutes. Lifesavers!
The food was incredible. Complex flavors in the dishes and excellently cooked chicken.
We also came back to try out the naan breakfast rolls. I had mine with the Persian scramble. Hands down the best breakfast I have ever had. I will definitely be coming back next time I am in London.",1
4,"We came here around 5 pm on Sunday evening before seeing Thriller Live. At that time, the line wasn't so insane, so we waited about 30 mins outside and about 30 or so minutes at the bar once we got inside before getting seated. The drinks are awesome, the food is awesome, the service is awesome. The place definitely lives up to its hype, I just wish they took reservations for parties under 6 people! Definitely going back here tho !",1
5,"This place was excellent! After quite a long queue, 1hr 10, everything was so good. The aesthetics are lovely, you feel unrushed without the service suffering, and while the portions LOOK small they are deceivingly filling and full of flavor. I would highly recommend this restaurant (at perhaps a less busy hour) but nonetheless recommend it, as it was wonderful from food, to ambiance, to service.",1
5,"I love it. I just love it. Anyone who knows me knows that I love it and I can't even put my finger on why? Especially because this review is solely focusing on their breakfast offerings. 
Of all the Dishoom locations this is probably the one with the least ambience and decor and for that reason you're usually more likely to get a table. Top tip: Even though you can't book in the evening unless you have 6+ in your party, you can in the morning so book your breakfast table to avoid a wait or disappointment! 
They do breakfast cocktails but do not start serving these until 11am so if you're looking to get started early - make sure you head in around this time. 
I have gone through pretty much everything on their breakfast menu by now and I have to say that the bacon naan with egg is still a winner. Those fluffy naan breads with the chutney inside just transforms the traditional bacon sarnie. I'm usually of the opinion that if it's not broke don't fix it but I'm so glad they fixed it. It's beautiful. 
The big bombay is their take on a 'full English' and it's massive. Home made beans or peoples take on beans is one of my pet peeves in trendy breakfast spots but the beans here are absolutely delicious and I have no idea what it is they have done to the eggs but again - taste sensation. 
I wont go through everything on the menu as that would be boring. The only thing I'd say is personally I really dislike their porridge and would avoid that but then, I've seen other people loving it so it depends on your personal taste. Personally, I'm not a fan of the coffee there either so usually opt for the freshly squeezed 
If you ask for a loyalty card you can get a free bacon naan after you've had breakfast there five times. Well worth it!",1
5,"Dishoom is excellent! My husband and I decided to try this place after searching for nearby Indian restaurants and I'm so glad we did. We walked in and got a table right away (we got there about 5:30pm on a Tuesday though). The decor of the restaurant was very cool. Our waitress was amazing. She was very helpful with the menu. They even have a color coated dairy free menu to help make decisions if you have any food allergies or preferences.
The food was so good! We enjoyed every bit of it and the price was good too. We spend 30£ total and were both perfectly full. I definitely recommend checking this place out.",1
5,"Dishoom came highly recommended by a friend. Fortunately she mentioned there could be a long wait - and there was - 1.5 hours. We arrived around 7pm on a weeknight. Was it worth it? Absolutely! Not only was it worth it but we came back a few days later for a late lunch and a shorter 40 minute wait. 
There was amazing and their specialty cocktails, all of which we tried, were unbelievable. And, it's not very expensive. Good food, good drinks, what more can we ask for? Service was attentive and they brought around mint and chai tea while we were waiting outside. 
We tried Indian at a few other London restaurants and they did not stack up to Dishoom. If you like gimlets try their specialty gimlet! Best I've ever had. Celery bitters is the secret ingredient. 
You will not be disappointed and you'll be glad you waited.",1
5,"I've eaten out 2-3x meals a day all over the UK for the past 40 days and this was the first meal I've had where I was genuinely impressed, with everything. Nothing lacking, in any regard.
Food was excellent - very flavorful, cooked to perfection, great diversity on menu with very distinct flavors. Service was very good, helpful with suggestions, attentive, and showed genuine care and concern for satisfaction with the experience.
The wait to be seated was handled impressively well with ginger chai tea served, an organized wait list handled on an iPad, and advance bar seating during the second half of the wait.
Perfection.",1
5,"Dishoom is absolutely worth the glowing reviews - better than we could have imagined. Came for a 30th birthday celebration and it delivered on all accounts - drinks, food, service and atmosphere. Nice work Dishoom!",1
4,"FOOD WAS GREAT, SERVICE NEEDS A TAD BIT OF WORK
I went to the one in East London. I thought the food was fantastic but was a bit annoyed with the waiter service. She was nice but we were waiting forever to get served. As a tourist on vacation, I expect to be served properly without waiting 20 minutes for them to take our order and having to flag down a waiter. Overall it's a really nice place with really good Indian food.",1
5,"Dishoom is one of my favorite places in London. There is always a queue but it is certainly worth the wait.
I'm sad they don't have the Rajma Frankie on the menu more (or maybe they'll rotate it back on) but the food here is always flavorful and delicious. The dal makhni is by far in my top 2 dals I've had ever had - second only to a place in Jaipur. Dishoom has some of the best roomali roti hands down. Whether you have it with your frankie or with another menu item, you can't miss out. I'm personally a fan of the dal (mentioned earlier), the frankies, pau bhaji, the chai and the kulfis. Every time I'm in London, I look forward to going to Dishoom (and will go out of my way to do so). 
The service here is always great and they do their best to get you seated as quickly as possible. I love the modern but also classic Bollywood decor, which gives this place great personality. If you live in London and you haven't been to Dishoom, what have you been doing?",1
5,"Obviously my favorite meal in London. The ambiance, the food, the drinks--amazing. You can make reservations if you go before 545pm, and I highly suggest it. We showed up around 445 and waited in line outside in the cold for over an hour. Then we're brought in where we had to wait a little bit longer (at the bar--how convenient for them) for them to prepare our table. I still give 5 stars though, I just don't understand why they have the waiting list the way it is.",1
5,"Who would have thought that the best Indian I ever had is in London. The food is absolutely amazing, I loved every dish I tried. Thx to my fellow yelpers, we ordered the black daal with prawns, ruby chicken and pau bauji. The ruby chicken was definitely my favorite. But all 3 were very flavorful, and the staff was very nice. Make a reso to avoid the long line. We didn't have a reso and arrived with an hour and half wait... No one left with this long line so we figured it must be good. TOTALLY WORTH IT! it was cold out and the hostess brought out chai teas for ppl in line, I thought that was a nice touch. You stand in line outside and then you get sent to the bar before you are sat down. Must try though, If you're craving for Indian food",1
5,"A six o'clock arrival at the back of the line on a Thursday night gave us a 40 minute wait outside with some chain, followed by a 20 minute pause at the bar. 
Downstairs is noisy, so we opted for an upstairs table on the street level.
Food was worth the wait.",1
3,"They do not take reservations after 6PM and it is a long wait. 1 hr they say, it really is one hour. Delicious food but small portions and expensive. Good atmosphere if you are upstairs. Downstairs is dark and low ceiling. After all the wait, you hope for a good table but they sit you where ever available. The coctails are notting special. Naan and lamb was great but chicken was avarage. Buryani was good basmati rice avarage. So, better to try for lunch but not for dinner.",-1
4,"If given the option, I would rate the service at a 5 and food at a 4. We were given an estimated wait time of 1 hour and 30 minutes, however it was much quicker. Also, the wait  included time spent at the bar (very small bar area downstairs). As we waited in line, we were served chai and given umbrellas for the rain. This was very convenient and excellent service! As for the food, it was very good, but it was not significantly better then some other places I tried in chicago. We ordered lamb samosas (good - comes with 4 pieces), house black daal (highly recommend), garlic naan (too burnt), Kachi lamb (very good), chicken ruby (good), mango lassi (okay - I probably wouldn't get it again because it was a bit bland), mint tea (I would not recommend because there were not enough mint leaves or did not steep long enough. It lacked a lot of flavor) and strawberry desert (very good if you like cream and strawberries. It was not very sweet, so it was perfect! ). Overall, the restaurant was a very good experience!",1
5,"Simply the best restaurant I've ever been to. There was a long line outside and we were told we'd wait around an hour and a half, but we only wound up waiting around 40 minutes. So, for those of you discouraged by the crowd gathered outside, fear not. Granted we had a party of two.
Food here was relatively cheap for the quality. I got the chicken ruby, which was tender and spicy, but not overly so. The sauce was delicious and I dipped my garlic naan in it after I was done with the chicken. The naan was soft, but may be too thin for some people. 
Our waiter was friendly and attentive. He shared some stories with us, which would usually be annoying but he was just a genuinely nice guy. He brought us raika for free to the table, which was creamy and tangy and paired well with the lamb biryani my mother got.
Overall a great experience!!",1
4,"Fantastic ambience with tapas style Indian street food. Amritsari fish is a star; wish the rest of the small plates were as tasty. Bar is really small but the cocktails are great with an Indian twist. 
Have been here multiple times over the last few years and have observed the service and food quality dropping and not sure if their growth has caught up with their neglect towards customers.",1
5,"Saturday night, we waited 2 hours to be seated but it was 100% worth it. The service is superb and the hostess would bring out drinks while we waited outside. Then you could be seated/ stand around the bar when space opened up and order some appetizers. We started with okra fries and samosas. The okra fries were addictive and wonderful - and I hate okra.
For dinner, we opted to share a bunch of plates. We got the lentils, ruby chicken, and keema pau. The keema pau was superb. It was all extremely delicious and perfect portions. Rice or bread is a separate order.
Indian food in London is a must and Dishoom is the place to go.",1
4,"very good indian. we were 7 so we had many dishes on the menu. biryani was great, as was the dahl. overall, great Indian food",1
5,"We had the chicken ruby, the lamb kabobs and the pau bhaji.  One was better than the other.  A couple of good drinks as well.  They got us in and seated much faster than promised, which was great.  Prepare to wait, but it's worth it.",1
3,"Chicken ruby - tender and heavenly. Heavenly tender. 
Paneer - too dry and too bland. 
Chai tea - nicely spiced, but could be larger. 
Chocolate mousse - ordinary and not worth the £5+
Pistachio kulfi - subtle and not too sweet. Like. 
Garlic naan - only 1 piece per person?!?",-1
5,"Awesome restaurant!   Very well organized, even though there was a long wait we were well treated and their system works very well. The Black Daal was amazing. Best Indian dish I've ever had. The Chicken Ruby was great as well. The naan and the other sides were good. Highly recommended.",1
5,"We went twice in 14 hours because this place is BOMB AF.  
Everything about the restaurant is really charming, from the design to the plating, and even the bathrooms.  I don't think that the food is overpriced like a lot of people are saying, the quality is really nice and they are in the heart of London and in London, everything is expensive.  
My favorite thing to get is the mahi tikka.  Fish is perfectly cooked and moist and tender and flaky and i dont even know what else to say you just gotta try it.
Ruby chicken is also awesome with just the right amount of spice and the sauce is great for tipping your naan or roti into.  
If you're looking for great drinks, Dishoom has them too.  They have a lot of original cocktail recipes, but if you're not into alcoholic drinks, their wide selection of lassis are great too.  My personal favorite is the rose lassi.
The lines can be long but the wait is worth it.  Just go in the afternoon on a weekday and there should be no wait.",1
5,"I'm salivating at my computer as I type. Utterly delicious evening. 
This place is run like a well oiled machine. Yes, you sometimes have to wait in line to wait in line, but the service is attentive and quick ... even when quoted a wait time of an hour and 20 minutes. The time flies by with a drink in your hand and an appetizer to munch on. Not to mention the decor gives you plenty of eye candy. 
Now for the food, mouth-gasms galore. The Ruby Chicken, House Black Daal, and Chicken Biryani were to die for. All absolutely perfect. If you don't know what to order, just listen to the wait staff. Although, let's be real. I already knew exactly what I wanted. Nothing better to do while waiting in line than to Yelp-stalk food. I need help.",1
5,"I'm a big Dishoom fan, but I'd never eaten at the Covent Garden restaurant until this week.
I dashed out of work at 5pm to try and beat the queues (no prebooking unless for 6 or more people and even then only a few tables can be prebooking). The queue beat me. I arrived and we had a 45 minute wait.
Luckily the brought out chai and mint teas and we probably only queued about 30 mins until we were seated at the bar to wait for a little bit longer.
We ordered lovely cocktails and were soon taken to our table.
Our waiter Joseph was really lovely, helpful and attentive. 
Dishoom is all about sharing dishes so we ordered keema pau, chicken ruby, black Dahl, lamb kebab, roti and rice. It was all delicious, plentiful and wonderfully flavoured. 
We all tucked in and thoroughly enjoyed our delicious dishes.
We treated ourselves to sharing a gooey chocolate dessert which came with a scoop of chilli vanilla ice cream. A wonderful, naughty end to the meal. 
We paid about £22 each for dinner and a cocktail each, which is really good value for a great meal in London. And our waiter even took our friends mocks ail when he noticed she hadn't drunk it cos she didn't really like the taste, which is fab service.
Get yourself to Dishoom pronto. Don't be put off by the queue... It's worth it!",1
4,"Upon first entry, I really liked the ambience. Simple but classy, western but with a tinge of Indian food scent in the air, it was the right balance of ethnic and sophisticated. 
The fourteen of us ordered three plates of each of chicken tikka, grilled prawns, veggie curry and a few other things. Everything was simple but solidly done. I particularly liked the chicken tikka masala and the grilled prawns. The former was just perfectly spicy to fit my taste, and the latter was flavourful despite the simplicity of seasoning. 
For drinks, I got chai then black coffee for desserts. Apparently, the chai here is highly recommended; I liked it but not being a chai expert, didn't really see what was so stand out about it. 
Finally, the staff was friendly overall and prompt in service.
Make sure you book in advance if you're more than a party of six. If not, I heard you need to walk in, so leave time for some extensive queues.",1
5,"The best Indian food I've ever had! My friend and I were in London on vacation, and I had heard about this place before, so we decided to try it! We arrived around 1:30 PM, and the hostess told us it would be about a 40 minute wait. She suggested that we wait at the bar. We both ordered drinks and some samosas. The Bollybellini. Was. AMAZING. So were the samoas!! 
After raving about how good the drinks were, we finally got seated. We ordered the Chicken Ruby, the Chef's special (it was shrimp in curry), rice, and naan. Everything was so delicious and filling- worth every penny! My friend had never had Indian food either, so this was a great first experience for her!
The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the interior of the restaurant was just gorgeous. I would definitely go back if I ever happen to be in London again!",1
5,"I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars because of the overall experience. 
My sister and I came to London for 3 days on a vacation and heard that the curry in london is great in general. I was looking a place at to eat, and this was the first one that popped up and read the reviews (which were positive) and decided to go there. When we first got there, the place was packed and there were people waiting to be seated. We were told that the wait time was going to be 25 minutes, to us that was fine. They told us that we were Able to wait downstairs at the bar. 10 minutes later, we got a table. The server was super nice and understanding. She explained everything to us perfectly. 
For starters, we got lamb samosas, which comes two per portion. Super delicious and flavorful! Then we ordered the chicken ruby, garlic naan, and steamed rice. The portions itself was perfect for two people! The food was super good, delicious and flavorful!!! YOu can taste everything in the chicken ruby! Really recommend it!",1
3,"Very average food if you know what indian food should taste like. Overall ambience and concept is nice, they have good indian fusion drinks. But as an Indian living in New York and visiting London, Indian food in NY is far better and authentic. To be fair, if you are in the area, this is probably your best bet",-1
5,"Never disappoints.  Worth the wait.  Flavor spectacular and a tight ship once seated, despite the usual long wait at the front end. Go early ;)",1
5,"When it comes to Indian food, I doubt if you will find a city outside of India that does it as well as London. 
Dishoom takes the cake for perhaps the best Indian food you can have in London. Move over Roti Chai, see ta later Masala Zone. I have a new favourite and it's called Dishoom (the word Dishoom is the sound of a gun shot in Hindi).
This place doesn't do reservations for parties of less than 6 people. And unfortunately, it is not only popular but in a high profile location, so there are always lines outside. Weeknights, you can expect to wait an hour during peak dining hours. Weekends is likely worse. But it is worth the wait! 
So, what to eat? Here are my faves so far, although I haven't tried everything on the menu yet. 
- Masala Prawns
- Rajmah Chawal (a must!)
- Daal (also a must!)
- Rumali Roti (again, a must!)
- Chicken Biryani
- Chicken Curry
So take my advice. Don't fret the long line. Just go here and if you are like most, you will think it was worth the wait. I certainly did.",1
3,"This was highly rated both on Yelp and Trip Adviser. When we arrived there was a line outside the restaurant. It was a bustling Saturday dinner crowd. The workers are very nice, we waited about 20 min and they ushered us in to the downstairs bar area to wait outside the cold. They also served some warm chai while we were waiting in line. 
On to the food. 
Most everything was pretty good, although portions a little on the small side. We had to order two extra dishes to be satisfied. 
For starters we got the calamari and fried okra. The fried okra was very good, not too slimy with a nice crunch. Calamari was OK, it had a slightly sweet taste which I didn't care for.
My favorite was the chicken ruby (not sure of the name). It's the only chicken curry on the menu. Flavorful with moist chicken chunks. 
We also got two of the grilled chicken dishes and the spicy lamb chops. The lamb had a good kick of flavor and not gamey, however for the price you only get three little chops.
The one thing I did not like was the must touted black dal. It tasted like re fried beans. Same texture and almost same flavor but with an Indian spice kick. 
Overall it was a good experience, the service was nice and food in general was good.",-1
5,"Oh My God Becky - this place rocks! Went last night after the theater, arriving after ten and it was packed, but got a table very quickly (good way around the lines - go late). It's got a great, crazy energy and love the decor! The husband and I shared okra fries and calamari with sauces and -- YUMM! Just the right amount of spice and so good! Then we shared the Ruby Chicken - I guess there is a God because it's the only way this dish could exist, and Lamb Boti Kabab with rice and a good helping of Roomali Roti to soak it all up with. Didn't try dessert because we wanted those spices to last forever. And the service? Right from the door it was perfection -- our waiter --OH HEY THERE ALI! - was hands down the best we've ever had -- great food guidance, amazing attention, and a quick discussion about the world political mess - what more can you ask for?  We're going back for breakfast and Ali has already guided our ordering. PLEASE OPEN IN SAN FRANCISCO!!!",1
3,"I wanted to love Dishoom so badly but it just let me down. I'd heard rave reviews from friends about how 'different' and delicious their brunch was, but what I got was glorified cheese on toast with very little chilli. It was lacking flavour and not particularly inventive (or well executed).
My companions both had the omelettes which were also left lacking. After waiting 40 minutes for a table it was just a bit meh. The service was pretty good but couldn't make up for  the dreary food.
Maybe save this one for dinner.",-1
5,"Wow all I need to say is make sure you order the black dahl and the Ruby Murray curry! I was very lucky to have managed to get a table with some colleagues as there more than 6 of us. We had one of the booths in the basement and it was a really lovely spot.
Want to come again with my bf but not sure if I can handle the idea of waiting for a table :)",1
5,"I've never went out of my way to try an Indian restaurant like I did for Dishoom. I walked 15 miles before I reached this gem!
After the long and exhausting walk, I seated myself in this nice, air conditioned, and loud restaurant. 
First impression- very modern restaurant and very pretty. I feel like everything in the UK is 10x more prettier and hipster than America lol.
We were seated within 5-10 minutes on a busy day on the main floor (there's a floor downstairs with the bathroom and very dim lighting, it's pretty awesome). We were given menus and these sauces that came in cute metal buckets. 
I forgot what I had ordered, but I remember that the chicken ruby, garlic naan, samosas, and basically everything was DELICIOUS. 
They were all pounding with flavor and I can still taste those spices lingering in my mouth! Yum.
Despite the long journey I had taken to reach this destination, I can say it was well worth it. & if I ever visit London again, I will for sure have this restaurant on the top of my visiting list!",1
5,"I don't like queuing, especially for food when I'm hungry. BUT Dishoom is worth the wait. You can't book (unless for 6+ people) so we got there before 6pm to try and beat the dinner rush a little later.
We were told the wait would be about 45mins but I think it was more like half an hour. They brought out complimentary hot chai to drink too.
Once at the front of the queue we were then able to go down to the bar. We ordered cocktails and just before they were brought over to us, our buzzer went off to say our table was ready. A waitress carried our drinks upstairs for us, which was a nice touch.
The staff are brilliant. Our waiter for the evening was Joseph and I can't speak highly enough of him. He was friendly, polite and attentive without standing over us.
We eventually chose our dishes between the four of us - keema, paneer, chicken ruby, lamb tandoori, black dhal, rice and roti. They were good size portions and I love this way of eating as you get a bit of everything. The only problem is I wanted to eat ALL the food! 
There were some amazing flavours of great spices without it being overpowering, there was also no nasty burn!
We then had a chocolate pudding with chilli ice cream to share as we were too full for dessert but couldn't resist it. It was rich and gooey and they ice cream was different. It was creamy vanilla with a delayed little kick of chilli at the end. Very nice and went well with the chocolate.
Three of us had the Bolly Bellini cocktail, which was delicious. At £7.50 it's pretty standard pricing for London but it was one of the best I've had anywhere. A must get!
One of my friends had a virgin cocktail and she ended up not drinking much of it. Joseph, the waiter, spotted this and asked her if she'd like something else instead and when she didn't he took her drink off the bill. Great service!
I'll definitely be returning, even if I have to queue!",1
4,"it's a type of restaurant that you have to wait in line from 30 minutes to an hour to be seated , the food choices were many, overall great experience",1
3,"The wait times are ridiculous. You can hang out in the bar downstairs while you wait and grab some snacks but you can't get a full menu down there, though some dining tables are downstairs (you still have to wait all the same). Lots of interesting stuff to try and delicious Chai while you stand in line.",-1
4,"I've only tried Dishoom for brunch and breakfast, the wait is always so long for dinner unfortunately. :-(
I love the food, it's fresh and varied, and their breakfast naans are to die for!",1
5,Wow amazing. From the usa we were expecting a much stronger curry flavor which does not appeal to my family.  Everyone liked just about everything. Loved the grilled chicken and lamb. The calamari was amazing.  Nan was good but the thin roti was the best.  And we all really liked the red curry chicken not to strong.  So good.,1
4,"Trendy and quality. I've eaten here several times and the food is always good, but the service is odd. They communicate via eearpiece which makes gives the impression of a mass-chain 'Garfunkles' type restaurant.",1
5,"I would personally ensure that this never runs out of business if it opens in NY - I loved the food that much. Unlike, Indian fare in US, this restaurant actually has a very good chef. Black daal is  the second best I have ever had(Dal Bukhara ITC tops the list). Vada pav was amazing and remarkably light. My friend had the Keema Pav and Chicken Ruby. 
They don't take reservations. We got in around 6 and had no problems getting a table. This place is a must every time you are in London.",1
3,"This is a very busy Indian restaurant that has efficiently streamlined their waiting-customer process. When I arrived on a weekend around 7PM (peak hour), there was a wait that they said would take 45 minutes. I decided to wait (table for 2) and they gave me one of those buzzers. I waited for 10 minutes and one of the hosts said there was room for me at the bar downstairs. I happily went down to the bar and sat down for another 10 minutes until the buzzer rang. Since I'm from the US and didn't have any cellular phone service, I was happy to use their free wifi (no password needed). If you're coming here in a group, do your best to make a reservation.
Our server was attentive and the food was good. I'd say that this is one of the best Indian restaurants I've ever been to (not just in the UK) based on food quality and atmosphere. You feel like you should be dressed up (at least business casual) at this joint.
I don't remember everything we ordered, but it included the house black daal (must-order), a chicken dish, garlic naan, roti, and mango lassi. Everything was pretty delicious and I don't think you can go wrong with whatever appeals to you on the menu. The only drawback about this place is the price. I guess they're popular enough to demand the amount they charge, but dang it costs like $6 USD for one piece of naan. If the naan wasn't so expensive I would for sure give this place 4 stars. Each person who wants naan/roti should get their own order because 1 order will not be enough for more than 1 person.
So, I'm happy I tried some Indian food in London (since there's a large population) and this would be the place I recommend for fancy, quality Bombay food.",-1
3,"Ok so many people have been hyping about this place I just had to give it a try. Unfortunately I really wasn't THAT blown away, it was good don't get me wrong however I won't be rushing back. But would definitely try it again, hoping that my first experience was just a bad-ish/average experience.",-1
5,"Super love this place!!! I could eat parathas and black daal everyday of my life. They have great drinks and the house chai is delicious. I always bring my friends here who want to try Indian food. My husband's favourite is the ruby chicken. They even have a full children's menu if you ask. Even my two year old loves it. But, it's super popular and gets quite busy with lines out the door. So get here early!!!",1
5,"This place has absolutely the best Indian food you can get in London. We were two people waiting for a seat on a Sunday afternoon and it took us around 30 mins to get one. We ordered a chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, a naan and a paav bhai (a heavier snack). All the dishes were delicious, I think I have never eaten better chicken tikka even in India. The service was courteous.
I am going to this place again!",1
5,"Amazing breakfast as usual at Dishoom today. I had the Chai tea, which was spicy, hot and never-ending --perfect for the cold, rainy morning it was. To eat I chose Keema Per Eedu, which was superb. The pau were delicious. 
My companions chose the Bombay Omellete and Bacon and Egg Naan Roll, and it was three very happy, full people that left the restaurant. 
As a side note, I love the way this place is decorated! The lighting fixtures are gorgeous, the pictures on the wall endearing and amusing, and the bathrooms always lovely.",1
5,"Best Indian food I've had in a while.
My co-workers have been raving about this place for weeks.
The wait is scary, always long and down the street, but me and my friends waited less than we expected and were taken to the bar.
Less than 5 minutes at the bar our table was ready, and the feast began.
EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS.
My favorites were the lamb samosas and the chicken ruby.",1
3,"So,  I don't know if I didn't get a taste of some of the magic mushrooms other reviews did in order to take this place so highly, but overall I found Dishoom to be pretty disappointing. 
Upon entering, the decor is nice and funky. Like someone else mentioned,  it's got a cool speakeasy vibe going on. I was really excited, but let down by the service from the beginning. Despite being pretty busy,  we were seated fairly quickly (probably only 15 minutes wait after being told 25-30), but that's when things just took a downturn. The guy who seemed to be in charge of seating seemed pretty disappointed when we said we hadn't ordered any drinks while waiting in the area by the bar, and then after he plonked us at a table, it took almost 15 minutes for someone to notice us and give us menus. 
But, I tried my best not to let it bother me, as I was excited for their ""Haleem"" dish, which was touted as so special and flavorful. 
From their online menu: ""for 8 hours we let the wheat, lamb and lentils simmer with precise quantities of coriander, turmeric, cumin and many other aromatic spices. Then the ingredients are pounded to intertwine and infuse the spices, release the flavour, and create a thick, smooth texture, almost a savoury porridge."" My partner ordered the haleem and when I tasted it, I really expected a total flavor explosion in my mouth. Instead, I got an underwhelming mouth of mush. I didn't have a problem with the texture, as it was as described, but I was really expecting more punch and more depth to a dish that was allegedly cooked down for 8 hours with spices. Just...okay. This chef's special, btw, came at a lovely premium of £16.50. Yes, you heard me right. £16.50. For a child's sized portion of porridge. 
For a drink, I treated myself to the Bombay Pimm's, which was basically just ginger beer in a highball glass with some bits and bobs thrown in the bottom. Waste of £7.50.
I also ordered the chicken ruby, which many people here totally raved about, but I also found it devoid of any depth of flavor. It was just any old tomato based sauce to me, and I was let down. Average tasting, but nice to soak up with the naan, which was delicious. 
Also disappointing, was dessert. A pineapple and black pepper crumble. I was excited for the combo, but when I dug in, found that all I'd really been served was a ramekin of dense, sugary flour crumble with the tiniest layer of unripe pineapple at the very bottom (bleh). I needed to drown it in the provided custard sauce in order to provide any moisture. Also, didn't even taste the slightest hint of black pepper.
 
Really, aside from the annoying service, Dishoom was nothing awful, but definitely underwhelming. Mediocre food and mediocre service, so no, not a very good value at all. I feel as though I could have gotten better, cheaper Indian food somewhere else in London where the staff would have paid a bit more attention.  
At the end of the night, I could tell someone at Dishoom knew deep down they'd screwed up, because the owner came over with discount vouchers to placate us. However, given what I think of Dishoom, the option of $10 off a $40 meal at a completely different location isn't exactly very gracious, in my books. Right now, I certainly wouldn't rush to go back (certainly not to the Covent Garden location), but maybe one night if feeling a little tipsy, I'd give Dishoom another try.

5,"First of all, Dishoom had me at the name. We came to celebrate after getting engaged (!!!). We had initially tried to stop by for dinner on a weeknight around 9pm and the wait was 2 hours. I love me some Indian food but when a girl's hungry she can't wait that long for food. I'm glad we came back 'cause a late lunch at Dishoom was perfect, and we didn't have to wait! 
This has gotta be one of the swankiest Indian restaurants I've ever seen. Love the old Bollywood movie posters and vintage humorous ads on the walls. The mirrors above the kitchen are sexy. Even the bathrooms were decorated expertly.
The food. Now, when I'm in London I always eat Indian food cause Indian food in America just doesn't compare. Dishoom is definitely one of the best Indian restaurants I've eaten at in London, and quite possibly the world - outside of my mama's kitchen, and of course, the Motherland. We had a terribly difficult time picking what we wanted to eat because everything sounded good. The pau bhaji was delicious. For something that is so simple, the chefs at Dishoom managed to elevate it into a spicy, sour, exciting appetizer. For entrees we ordered the Chicken Ruby and the Kacchi Lamb biriyani. The Chicken Ruby, Dishoom's version of tikka masala, was finger-lickingly divine, especially with a perfectly made roomali roti. The sauce was well seasoned and had just the right amount of butter. The Kacchi lamb biriyani (made Hyderabadi style) was on point. My Hyderabadi fiancé (!) verified its authenticity. The lamb was tender and moist and the rice was delicately flavored. You must get raita with biriyani, and this raita did not disappoint. 
Our server was very friendly and sweet. Prices are very reasonable for a London restaurant. When we left, full and happy, we saw a line of about 25-30 people waiting to enter for happy hour.  Overall, Dishoom deserves to take all my stars. The next time in London, I'll definitely be back.",1
4,"I think I'm addicted to the squid. I love asian food and a lot of the main dishes are solid 7/10's but the chilli squid and bacon naan roll (morning breakfast) are stand out dishes.
The cocktails are actually very good too. It's definitely a fusion of East meets west eventhough it is portrayed as Bombay cafe. The decor is a lovely feature of this place in a world that seemingly nowadays. Overall I'm glad they have opened more branches. Hopefully not TOO many but it's refreshing to see Indian cuisine represented in this way with good quality to match.",1
5,The best food I've had in London hands down and I've been here for 10 days. This place has amazing flavor and the staff was extremely nice.,1
5,"Worth waiting. We got confused about the menu, staff was really nice to explain",1
4,"The food was VERY good here (or maybe it was the result of finally eating after our hour-45 minute wait). We got the Black House Daal (lentils), Chicken Ruby, Spicy Lamb Chops, a garlic and a plain naan - 3 of us. Each dish was so flavorful, rich and served hot! (which I love). The Chicken Ruby (4 pieces) is the second best chicken I have ever eaten - so tender and juicy. The Spicy Lamb Chops (3 pieces) with pomegranate was so good we ordered a second 2/3's into our meal. I would definitely give Dishoom 5-stars if it weren't for the wait.
For the foreigners (Americans) who dine here: (since the host said 75% of the people who eat here are foreigners)
- the wait is long! the host said the shortest wait times are before 5:30pm
- there is free wifi in line and in the restaurant
- the hosts are friendly and pass out free House Chai to the line
- reservations are only permitted for parties of 6+
- the waits are just as long at other Dishoom locations (we checked out the King's Cross location the day before and the wait was just as long)
- but inside, the service and ambiance are great",1
4,"Islamic hipsters rejoice. Yes many many woman in head scarfs waiting in line...like us for a tasty meal at Dishoom.
Dishoom is a great take on Bombay street food. It is relatively inexpensive and their drink menu was creative and great...loved the Bombay Pims.
The lamb was amazing as was the ruby chicken curry. The star was actually the Black Dall...crushed lentils in a great sauce. 
The starter calamari was good with the three sauces but it was not wow...just nice and crispy and not oily.
I waited in line for about an hour before being served....and I was there at 6:30. 
Place is noisy as well. But if you don't mind waiting and the noise...I would highly recommend this place.
Plus the owners are really nice people. 
There is a new one in Shoreditch and they are opening up two more in London as well...AWESOME",1
5,"Really is as good as everyone says. Great food done in an imaginative way. 
Went with my partner and although we both loved the atmosphere as it had a real buzz about the place, can't help think it's probably best going with a larger group - perhaps not ideal for couples on a date!",1
3,"Value to money is good; value to time is not. One hour wait really raised our expectations, but the food turns out to be not worth the time we spent in the line. If you have time and can wait, sure. Otherwise, don't waste your life",-1
5,"Rumali chicken Kati roll.. a classy twist to the street side Kati rolls of New York City. Wonderful ambiance, friendly staff and reasonable prices. Will visit again",1
5,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in London, and that's saying something. I have been to the Covent Garden and Shoreditch locations for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and can definitely say that the food is fantastic (the drinks are as well!) and the service is always good.I honestly haven't had a meal there I didn't like, and I always waddle away satisfied and hating myself for finishing a meal fit for 3 people. I will say that if you have a chance to book a table, do so. While I have been and immediately gotten a table, there have been times when, since it's London, they say it will be a two-hour wait (although, when they said that we only ended up waiting for 30-45 minutes). Sometimes there's a line out the door and down the street, but it's definitely worth the wait!",1
5,"Hands down my favourite restaurant in London - the Black Daal is a must
There will be a que if your going for dinner but do not walk away, you will regret it!",1
4,"Dishoom has everything you need from Mumbai. I used to work in Mumbai for a few years. And Dishoom actually made me nostalgic. Everything at this place including the tables and chairs, remind me of some cafe in Colaba, Mumbai. 
Absolutely Indian. The house Chai was fantastic. I don't think I have had Indian Chai like that any where else in London. 
As Dishoom made me nostalgic, I thought I'd get adventurous and ordered some very Mumbai-ish stuff. Vada pav! Can you believe it? Vada pav is India's answer to Burger. And I used to hog lots of them from the street side vendor near my office in Mumbai. And I have to admit that Dishoom has made it only better. They served it with some chillies and chilli powder. And it is not for those who don't eat spicy food, it is authentically hot! Specifically made for the Indian tongue. Great combination with the Chai. 
I also tried the Pav Baji and I couldn't believe it. This has got to be someone from Mumbai cooking. Loved every bit of it. 
But I wasn't done yet. I wanted to try out their Naan and some curries. But Dishoom is not a traditional curry house. It is a cafe and they openly admit that it is a cafe, so they have more snacks and chat and grills and frankies than traditional meals and curries. 
I went for the Matter Paneer and Garlic Naan. Wow! Flavour rich! It made me believe that I was in India.  
But after all that spice rich flavours in my mouth I was still yearning for more. I chose Cinnamon Ice cream for dessert and yet again I drifted away in my fantasy Mumbai. 
Everything was served in less than 10 minutes. And I was extremely pleased. This is heaven for Indian food lovers and those who have a connection with Mumbai.",1
4,"Proudly writing my first review for London. I had no idea Yelp would be so useful in finding the perfect dinner place in London. 
Visited this place on a Saturday night after seeing the Yelp reviews. Place was crowded and we waited about 20 mins. But absolutely no complaints, had a great time. This place has kitchen open till 11 pm which is fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting London. Of course, greater London has several hundred Indian places that are probably even better than Indian food in India,  I am sure you can find individual dishes better than this place in small restaurants scattered around London, but this place offers a sweet combination of Bollywood, upscale atmosphere and tasty Indian food. So I would definitely recommend going here at least once while you are in London.
We tried the Pav bhaji, Roomali roti (Yes, they have roomali roti! -  which is certainly a rare sight in the US, Black daal, cheese toast and Kulfi. The black daal, as other reviews say, was really very nice. I really liked the Pav bhaji too, it was pretty close to what I have had on Bombay streets (buttery, tart and spicy). The roomali was very nice, and it was also fun to see the roti maker flipping the rotis through the glass window in the kitchen. I would rate the Kulfi the least, although it was well placed in an Indian style glass on a stick, it seemed the frozen lot and not fresh. I would probably go for the gujju style chocolate mouse instead. The cream cheese toast was average. They also have some chaat (Bhel puri etc.) on the menu. They have a full bar downstairs, but no draught beers. Doesn't matter much as being carb heavy doesn't go with the already carb heavy Indian cuisine. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the music and food, even the lamb and chicken dishes. People were sprawling, and not just Indians - it was good mix of people, mostly young. 
Very refreshing to see an Indian restaurant proudly portraying Indian art, bollywood memorabilia and celebrating Indian culture. I especially loved the ambiance. Well decorated, flattering lighting and some amazing Bollywood memorabilia from 70s and 80s. Great for a date night as well.",1
4,"When I went there I had to wait at a 20 minute queue(though I was told it would take longer) but at least they got us tea to make out wait easier. The service is very good and the food is delicious. I definitely recommend getting lamb as it is very well cooked. The prices are a bit high and can quickly stack up if you order many dishes and you may be tempted because some of them are quite small, but it is not generally worth it, if not the best deal. Definitely worth a try.",1
5,The best Indian food I have ever eaten. The Ruby Chicken is fantastic as are the spicy lamb chops. Don't miss the mashed vegetable or garlic naan. And they are right about the chocolate pudding -- you will not want to share it! we waited an hour an ten minutes on line but it was well worth it.,1
5,"My husband loves the food here, strongly recommend chicken ruby , very nice sauce with tender chicken",1
5,"Great food! Nice atmosphere! Friendly service. 
Chicken Ruby was delicious, but the Lamb lollipops were amazing. It had wonderful flavor. 
Wish we could've stopped by more time than once during our 4.5 days in London.",1
5,Really enjoyed this place. I got the chicken ruby and it was very good. Not too spicy but very good flavor. Make sure you get the garlic naan as well. I would love to go back and try even more next time.,1
5,Went to Dishoom with a friend and was totally blown away. Delicious cocktail to start and after a minor table mix up we were given complimentary drinks. Excellent customer service. The food was delicious and we both left feeling satisfied but not uncomfortable which is not an easy balance to strike. My only regret is I haven't made it back yet.,1
5,"If you're in London and looking for some delicious, satisfying Indian food, this is the place to go. We waited over an hour in line and it was so worth it. They were serving free small drinks to those waiting in line, which is very nice. All the staff were pleasant. On to the food--My husband and I are curry lovers, and their curry is definitely one of the best we've ever had. Even the rice was spectacular--how does one even make Basmati rice spectacular??? I don't know, but they sure did. I was looking at starters and desserts, but all we had to eat was that one curry and we were so stuffed and satisfied. I will also note, I have Celiac Disease and the wait staff was very well informed and kind when dealing with me and my needs. There are plenty of gluten free options on the menu. I didn't get sick at all, which means their kitchen did what was necessary to keep my food safe during preparation. Overall, a great experience.",1
4,"I discovered Dishoom while searching the internet for exceptional Indian food in London during a recent trip. The details -- from the rotary ceiling fans to the steel cups to the pervasive aroma -- all intend to transport you to the Persian-style cafes of Bombay, India. As a side note, the menu is really well-done; you can almost sense the passion in flowery descriptions of the exotic offerings. Unfortunately, I wasn't particularly hungry unfortunately so we only ordered a few dishes. The Awadhi Lamb Biryani, a fragrant rice preparation, was decent but didn't blow me away. The meat was fairly soft and had strong taste, but the dish was slightly dry overall so I would order yogurt-based Raita on the side. The Mattar Paneer was fantastic, with spongy morsels of cheese soaked in a tangy tomato-and-pea sauce. The signature Black House Daal was the best course we tried by far and boasted a strong sourness that was counter-intuitive but added to the rich flavor. Get an order of Roomali Roti, a soft and stretchy flatbread, to soak up all the broth and spices.",1
3,"The food was genuinely not Indian. I do understand the need to westernise Indian cuisine as the habits may vary. However, you don't have to pretend to render it gastro when all you do is scrap all the spices from traditional daal or curry. 
Naan bread was delicious as well as the chai.",-1
4,"Went here last night for dinner. First off its easy to see how popular this restaurant is. The line to get it is out the door despite there being plenty of other restaurants around.
My wait was an hour and a half. The waiters do come out and serve Indian tea which is great while standing out on a chilly night. Once you are called in they direct you to the downstairs bar for an additional 10 minute wait. 
For the food, I ordered: 
Vada Pai as an appetizer. It came in a nice warm toasted bun. This potato sandwich was tasty. Had the right amount of spices and flavor. Its small enough to eat on your own or cut in half and share.
Lamb kabab was not good at all. The lamb was greatly lacking in flavor and was severely over cooked. It was tough and practically inedible. 
Chicken Ruby was delicious!  The chicken was very tender and marinated perfectly. I ate this with naan and a roomali roll. 
All in all the place is great, food is good and prices are very reasonable. Worth the wait if theres a line to get in. Will definitely visit on my next trip to London.",1
4,"Good Indian food, but a bit more expensive than other good Indian places in London, you pay the exrta for the great atmosphere! Good service but a long queue, luckily you van wait in their Bombay styled bar!",1
5,"Since moving to London three months ago, I have visited Dishoom on three occasions (twice for dinner and once for brunch), and they have all have been great experiences!! My friends visiting from Texas and LOVED it. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by multiple people before getting seated. 
Our food was delicious (especially the Black Dahl and Garlic Naan!) The chicken ruby is also a must! 
Would definitely recommend this place to anyone that passes through London. Great sharing portions and great vibes for a group of friends.",1
3,"Ah Dishoom... Where do I begin?!
I suppose I'd better jump on the band wagon and shout about the breakfast! This really is one of my favourite places to go for breakkie in London! Served until 11am, the selection of classic breakfast favourites with a twist really hit the spot and come at a very reasonable price! My favourite is the sausage naan with a bottomless chai, coming to less than £10, but there is also the deliciously sticky porridge and a selection of eggs spiced to perfection! 
For lunch or dinner I'm less keen on Dishoom. The distinctive flavours of the breakfast are not repeated across the main meals menu, and for the price id rather save some money and sacrifice the dining 'experience' and head to my local curry house for generous portions that really hit the spot! 
At the mention of experience, that's really what you're choosing when you decide to go to Dishoom. Decked out with spine tingly accuracy like a British Raj club house, you'll be greeted by wafts of incense and carafes of water in tin cups. Where I find Dishoom disappointing, though, is that this experience is not always continues by the staff. Service is often slow (and strangely more so the quieter it is!) and mostly served by a hipster with a 'too cool for this' attitude, which somewhat dulls the excitement of going to one of London's current favourite food venues! 
My advice for those of you thinking of going to Dishoom? 
Go for breakfast, but only if you don't have to rush to be somewhere before lunch- and you'll love it!",-1
5,"This place was incredible, easily located near the theaters for a great dinner experience before or after the theater. All of our food was SO good and we ordered more of the naan just because it was too good to not have an extra order of. The environment is also really fun- loud- but it has a gorgeous interior and I really liked the raised booth that we sat in.",1
4,"I'm a big fan of Dishoom, but I think the bottom line is: would I stand in line, in the cold, to dine here? 20 minutes, maybe, but probably not much more.
You see, Dishoom's best when it's empty! At 10am on weekdays you'll see couples brunching, singles with or without laptops (free wifi btw, which they call 'chaifi' hahaha), it's all very relaxed, the restaurant feels airy and bright, and why hello there, BOTTOMLESS CHAI FROM 8AM - 5PM (MONDAY TO THURSDAY)! Breakfast at dishoom is truly underrated. And ultimately, the food's just better when it's less busy.
For breakfast, get the egg naan roll. 4 out of 5 times it's done perfect - gooey, runny yolk, and who knew cream cheese went with fried eggs? The magic really is the fresh herbs and tartness of the tomato chili jam thing, it's addictive. And of course, fluffy yet dense naan with just the right amount of chew. That and a cup of chai.. best way to start the day.
Lunch and dinner, where do I begin?
Okra fries - crispy, deep fried veggies, what's not to like?
Pau bahji - veg could've had more flavour but the bread's a buttered, fluffy cloud!
Skate cheeks - ah, are my favourite! So so juicy, tender and that tamarind!!!
Mahi Tikka - so moistttt and super tasty
Naan's better than the roti (just personal preference really)
Feel like I've tried more dishes but I guess they weren't as memorable. Overall, I really like Dishoom (both here and Shoreditch) but it's definitely anglicised indian fare, so don't expect anything super punchy! Oh and try the kulfi! It really is just frozen condensed milk but the consistency sure it satisfying!
Also, having been to this branch and the one in Shoreditch multiple times, somehow the food is always slightly better here, but the ambience / decor in Shoreditch really takes the cake.",1
4,"This restaurant had lots of charm and nostalgic decor mixed with contemporary feel. Service was on point with the whole team asking and providing for your dining needs. Iced water, napkins, more condiments clean toilets? Check, check, check. Eclectic old school Indian photo or product with packaging to keep you interested? Check!! 
Really enjoyed the ambiance.
Now to the food. Ordered the Chicken Ruby and Bryani, lamb Samosas for appetizer.
Portions were small but the food overall was good. Not spectacular as you would expect from the reviews, but just good, even at the spicy level. 
What makes this place special is everything else. Great place to hang with friends, drink and be merry. Definitely passes the would I eat here again test. Bring friends, this is a must try.",1
5,"We popped in for dinner one weeknight and found that there was a wait.  We were sent downstairs to the bar and my God what a revelation!
The cocktails were quite outstanding, as were the friendly and skilled bartenders.  Literally everything we tried was new, interesting, and expertly made.  And we made an extensive sample of the in house cocktail menu.
The Indian food was very good, but the cocktails were a knockout.",1
5,"My favourite breakfast place. Try the bacon nann, better than a bacon sandwich. They have a great selection of non-alcoholic drinks. Worth knowing that if you order the Chai Tea when you eat in, you can get free refills :)",1
5,"OK, hype or no hype this restaurant was every bit as good (if not better) as it was built up to be.
Where do I start? 
Our table on the terrace was Position A for people watching. And people watching we did (I'll get back to this in a second). The bar makes beautiful drinks and we had many. The menu is just mesmerizing. It's like an old colonial restaurant's menu in Bombay India. So tantalizing you want to order everything.
We started with an almost sweet and sour fried calamari. Wow was it good. I could have ordered two more of these puppies and called it a day.
We had their specialty of the house which is called black house daal and is a curried lentil dish that is out of this world. Ordered with garlic naan it is scrumptious.
A chicken salad and a few more beers and this was a lunch to remember.
The atmosphere is charming! Not taking itself to seriously it has great old school colonial art, writings on the walls that is humorous and very Indian.
I went downstairs where the kitchen and yet another bar is. Charming is all I can say.
The service is top notch, but that brings me back to the people watching; so our young attractive waitress was taking such good care of us, but then this super good looking guy comes in and takes a seat right next to us. This young man turned every females head in the entire restaurant. My wife (who is old enough to be this boys mother) lost her breath. Our waitress was so gaga'ed by this ""HUNK"" she was worthless from that point on. I'm not going to lower this five star review due to some primal instinct. That's not fair to Dishoom. 
This was a culinary high point of our trip to England. We are so happy we ate here.
BTW, he was gorgeous!",1
5,"I am in love with Dishoom. We had a great selection, and each dish was as flavourful and delicious as the next. We arrived quite early so only waited for about 20 mins. So so so worth it!
Would highly recommend the Chicken Berry Britannia Biryani, and the Chocolate Chai (bet the Naughty version with bourbon is nice, too!)",1
5,"The great interior space provides a true feeling of an Indian Cafe with a very casual feel which makes it ideal for an amazing breakfast experience or a laid back lunch.. 
The service is attentive but not intrusive so you can easily even hold meetings here (as i seen some people do) but i would recommend to either save it for dates & casual dining with friends.
You can easily eat for two here for under a tenner but I would highly recommend trying a few of the more unusual things on the menu.
If you want something simple for breakfast the house granola is the best i ever had and all the dishes i tried are freshly prepared & provide a great healthy but filling breakfast. As for lunch if you like indian food, you are going to love Dishoom.
The House Chai is a cardamom flavored milky tea and it's amazing, as is the Chai Chocolate, both of which you can have with dipping toast.
Whenever i pass by and i don't have time to sit in I always get a chocolate chai for takeaway :)",1
5,"So good!  We wanted the best Indian food in London and we found it. The chicken ruby, the naan bread with garlic, the other stuff I can't pronounce.  Truly, go here and get the best ever!!
Get there early unless you want to queue for at least 30 mins or more. Fast service.  Food comes out as it is ready, not in the order you place it.  Deal with it.  It works!",1
5,"Really nice service! My friend was late for half an hour but luckily they let me to occupy that table and wait. The food is tasty, especially curry and pots, though each dish is a little bit small. Would recommend garlic naan and chicken ruby. don't like okra fries very much.",1
5,"For those of you not familiar with Dishoom, it's a restaurant styled in homage to the Irani street food cafés which make up Bombay. I've been to Dishoom for dinner, which is great. but for the purpose of this review - let's talk breakfast! 
There's three across London (Covent Garden, Shoreditch and Kings X), I went to the one in Kings Cross branch. The building itself is beautiful and one of the largest in London. In what used to be a transit shed, the restaurant has been built to include cobble floor from the original stables with exposed wrought iron beams and high ceilings. Black and white photos and memorabilia adorn the walls much the style of its now trademark style.
The breakfast food is outrageously good but there was only ever one dish for me - the bacon naan roll. I'd heard great things about it and it did not disappoint! The bacon was spot on for me - I like my bacon erring on the rubbery side but with a slight crisp  - and the naan was soft, fluffy yet slightly charred. All this coupled with the sweet and tangy chilli jam made me one very happy customer! Other dishes on the menu include akuri - spicy scrambled eggs and kerjriwal - fried eggs on chilli toast. Both, i'm told, are delicious but nothing comes close to that bacon naan!",1
5,"The decor is cozy, vintage, and modern.  The service is great.  The food is even better.  
We ordered the calamari, house black daal, kacchi lamb, and masala prawns.  All were delicious but my favorite dishes were the calamari and house black daal.  The calamari was perfectly fried and seasoned.  The house lack daal was rich and complemented all of the other dishes.  I wish I discovered this place earlier!",1
4,"I'm now officially obsessed with this place having come for breakfast two Saturdays in a row, lured by the Keema Per Eedu. It's a decadent mixture of chicken mince, delightfully spiced, accompanied by chicken livers and topped with two runny eggs and crunchy potato sticks. My usual approach is to squeeze in a bit of lime juice, then put a yolk and a few healthy spoonfuls into a pau bun. The dish is really flavorful, and the spices leave you mouth tingling. A swig of house chai will confoundingly heighten the spice for a second before cooling the fires and preparing you for your next bite. It borders on too much food, so rich, but is clearly my new crush. 
Oh, and by the way, the husband and three kids also come along but it's more about me than them. Booking for breakfast makes seating for a family of five a breeze. My kids (ages 3, 7, 9) are well fed from selections like Fire Toast (thick, hearty slices of lightly charred toast and interesting jams), Bun Maska (a fluffy bun, split and buttered, served with chai), house porridge (never-ending portion and flavored of banana and dates), house granola and fruit and yogurt. My husband's tried the Big Bombay and the Bacon Roll on naan. 
I'm just enamored with Dishoom and now working up the courage to wait in line one evening for dinner.",1
4,Food was awesome! Lots of spices and flavors! Service was the best I had my entire trip in London. We had a guy named Gabri he was a tour guide for the menu. Loved everything about the meal.,1
5,"Dishoom lives up to all of the hype! Inventive, beautiful Indian street food. Fantastic cocktails. I would go every week if I could afford it...",1
4,"I haven't (yet) embraced the idea of queuing outside for 45mins for a burger & chips, but I'm happy to queue up for Dishoom for some reason. Okay, actually for three reasons: 1) they give you free boozy chai outside, 2) once in, you wait in the cool little bar downstairs, and 3) the food is good. Okay fine, it's *mostly* the free bourbon-spiked chai!
When it comes to Indian restaurants, if a place can make me forget my 'it's no mum's cooking!' feelings and come back for more, then I figure it's doing something right. Dishoom with its bustling Bombay teahouse feel is definitely doing so. From the low hanging glass lamps (like wiring was an afterthought), old family photos on the walls and vintage medicines and toiletries on display in the loos, everything invites you in for a closer look.
Food-wise everyone will have their faves, but I've found the bhel has a great kick, pau bhaji is yum (though I like mine with more onion on top) and the house black daal is worth a try. Need to go again with some non-veggies to try more meat dishes I think but skip the lamb boti kabab (other grills yet to be investigated), and get a side of okra fries no matter what else you're having.
Drinks-wise there's a nostalgia hit for me from getting chai in authentic glass cups, and seeing Limca on the menu (basically it's their 7UP - my sis and I got addicted to this on a childhood trip to India!). Fusion cocktails work with differing degrees of success - wasn't much chai in the chaijito but the bombay pimms was better. Still working on trying them all.
The overall package is a hit for me anyway. Decent value dishes too, though the whole small-plate-sharing thing always means you end up ordering loads! Though it always seems to get finished off somehow... :)",1
3,"Dishoom is handily located in the heart of Covent Garden and as a result it was packed out at 10 pm on a Sunday evening when I paid it a visit.
The place smells amazing but the food didn't quite live up to the aromatic promise. I ordered the chicken ruby (extra kudos for them using cockney rhyming slang) along with rice but it doesn't really compete with some of the curries I have had in London for a cheaper price. Solid but not spectacular.",-1
5,"Breakfast here was amazing ! It was absolutely delish!
Customer service was just as wonderful as the food was ! Everyone was so nice and very helpful!",1
5,"This was my family's first food destination in London, and thankfully so.  The wait wasn't terribly long, but surprising considering we got there shortly after dinner opened (~35 minutes wait).  Luckily you get to order appetizers and drinks in their bar downstairs in the meantime.  The lamb samosas were quite good to start out with, but only a teaser to what was ahead for our meal.
We eventually got situated at our table and were greeted with friendly service.  The waiter recommended the Murgh Malai, Chicken Tikka (spicy), and I believe the Chicken Ruby.  The first two dishes themselves are only grilled meat, which is what we ordered, and so he recommended to order (what most reviews here are raving about) the Black House Daal. We followed his recommendations and also ordered garlic naan on the side. The food didn't take terribly long considering how busy they were, and we tried it out.
Hands down, this was the best taste out of ALL the restaurants my family went to, spanning the food in Paris, Venice, Rome, and Prague.  The blend of aromatic spices in the daal, perfectly tender and juicy grilled chicken (both the Murgh Malai and Tikka were good, but I would recommend the Tikka for flavor), and the perfect pinch of cilantro, red onion, and tomato? medley all led to a superb tasting meal.  The only gripe was the cost - the single meat portions are a bit small, so we ended up ordering 3 portions for the 2 of us, and altogether everything cost 43£!  It was a bit of a surprise, but I guess it is London after all.  You can get by with a 10-15£ order per person but we were just too hungry at the time.  Other than that one minor drawback, this should hands-down be your #1 destination for food during your stay in London.",1
4,"The food was great, the service was a little slow but the staff were really nice so it all balanced out.",1
4,"Service 5 stars
Food 4.5 stars
Having to wait to eat 3 stars 
If you have time to wait this place is well worth the place. The menu is original and tasteful while also delivering the same classic flavours you crave from a popular establishment like this.
Well done Dishroom and hope to visit you again soon,",1
5,"I love this place. Dishoom was recommended to me before I moved to London by an Indian friend born and raised in London and another local. I really didn't understand what 'Indian street food' is and how this is any different than other Indian places I've been.
Well it is. I've brought multiple people whenever they are visiting from the US. I think it was best when my best friend, claims to be a staunch hater of Indian food, agreed to eat there and proclaimed she could find items she liked. Ca ching.
Ordering: House Black Daal is a MUST. So buttery, so smooth. I dream about this.
I really enjoy the murgh malai. Very tender chicken. Note it might come out pink but it is cooked through (don't be scared).  Definitely add one or two orders of the garlic naan.
Other food dishes (just not as awesome) include pau bhaji (spicy). Chicken berry britannia (unique with the cranberries) and chicken ruby.
There is always a queue as they don't accept evening reservations for groups under 6. The staff working the door are friendly and they bring you hot chai while you wait. You may also find yourself singing 'warm kitty' in queue.
Continuing on service, each time I have gone all servers have had a smile on their face and been very helpful. But my favorite is Sapna. Beautiful, friendly, helpful with ordering - she is a gem at Dishoom. 
Enjoy your meal. You won't regret it.",1
5,"I understand some folks may think this place is a bit too polished or caters too much for the Anglo-Saxon pallet, but who cares if it's freakin' great? On a recent business trip to London I visited this place twice and would be going there for lunch right now if I wasn't 5,000 miles away. =(
The Dishoom Chicken Tika was superb in both its tenderness and spiciness. If you like Chicken Tikka Masala then you can do no better by ordering the Chicken Ruby. The spicy richness of this curry dish was sublime, and far more complex than most Indian joints reach for. Two thumbs up in my book. 
Not to be left out is the House Black Dal, which being from Texas, reminded me of meatless chili. But I mean that in the best way possible. It was fantastic and I could not get enough of it. Their roti was fine, however the naan was by far not the best I've ever had. That said, I didn't come to Dishoom for bread. The decor of the place is pretty classy and if there's a line, which there will be on most evenings it seems, don't be afraid of it. Just wait it out as the food comes quickly and the line moves rather swiftly. In summary, Dishoom = Boom, goes the dynamite.",1
4,Great food! Very good staff that is eager to make an effort to get things right (my old fashioned drink was not an old fashioned until the 3rd try). A pleasure to visit and lives up to the hype. Give it a try!,1
5,"Delish!!!! The reviews did not lead me wrong.  Perfect portions, intriguing flavors.  Great chicken tikka masala.  Great spot.  I would come again.",1
5,"The cocktails are delicious and food always amazing. Great for large groups & for reasonable prices.
You may have to wait a little bit for a table when it's busy but at Kings Cross the bar area has a great atmosphere for a few pre-dinner drinks.
Staff are always super helpful in recommending dishes based on numbers & are very knowledgeable about the menu.
Onya!",1
4,"Dishoom was definitely a good experience. We arrived without a reservation (bad idea) but we were accomodated in their bar underground (with curious drinks which we tried to our satisfaction!). In about 30 minutes there was a table for us. 
Dinner is served family style as they would say in the US, dishes come as soon as they are ready and are sizable enough to share. We enjoyed every single dish we picked, and the service was fast and courteous enough.",1
5,"Amazing food and service, totally worth the wait! Drinks also quite good. Lovely atmosphere as well. Ate the chicken tikka, black daal, garlic naan, ruby chicken, chole (chick peas). All amazing. Dessert was also quite good. Highly recommend.",1
4,"I couldn't quite bring myself to give this place 5 stars for the same reason many here have explained: the wait. Granted, my wife and I arrived on a Saturday evening at about 5:30, but still. 
Then again, the wait itself wasn't too awful. The line serpentined in front of the entrance and a lovely host greeted each party individually explaining the wait time (a MAX of 1 hour 10 minutes--which turned out to be a bit short of the actual wait) and asking if we had any questions. They also offered free lattes for anyone waiting.
The total wait time involves three stages: wait outside, wait just inside the entrance, and wait downstairs at the bar. I don't know if this was making me more apprehensive or alleviating the wait time by creating a sense of ""we're moving along now!""
The food itself was great, albeit on the smaller side for dishes that should be shared. We ordered the chicken tikka (great chicken, though does NOT come with any sauce or curry), the Black House Daal (which offered some great moisture to the chicken), naan, rice, and vegetables. No issues with the food other than the fact that the waiter seemed surprised by what we were ordering. Not sure why.",1
4,"It took quite a while before I first visited Dishoom.
On my first visit, we had just missed the breakfast menu, so we settled for the all-day menu. Our waiter was friendly and kindly recommended some dishes for us to share.
We ordered some naan and a few curries to share, including the house black daal which was quite dark and rich.
I ordered the House Chai, and also redeemed my free mango lassi as it was my first visit. Felt so full (but happy) towards the end :p
On my second visit, me and my friend dropped in for brunch. I tried the chocolate chai this time, which was very warming and comforting after coming in from the cold outside.
I finally tried the much talked about bacon naan roll which had chilli tomato jam, cream cheese and herbs. Warm and freshly made, though I would have preferred more of a kick from the chilli (me and my love for spiciness...) 
We also ordered the Akuri - spicy scrambled eggs, which is an Irani staple. A lovely blend of spices - I may actually try this at home sometime and add some excitement to my scrambled eggs, ha.
Overall I enjoyed the food, and also the ambience of the place. A wide variety of small dishes to share and centrally located close to Covent Garden/Leicester Square station.

5,"So delicious - really really tender tikka masala. A bit spicy but the yogurt sauce really cuts it. Also, random - but the mint sauce they serve with every meal is UNBELIEVABLE. 
Lots of hype, trendy, but good food to back it up.",1
4,"Food was excellent, and the service was good, but was very loud, and they seemed a little disorganized. Had a better experience at the Soho location, but would still recommend for the tasty Indian food.",1
4,"Very cool Indian spot in Covent Garden! I heard a lot of good things about this place before I went but wasn't expecting it to be all nice and modern looking. Not really sure why, but I was thinking it was a hole in the wall and was completely thrown off when I came up on it. 
My large party was seated at one of the booths downstairs. We decided on ordering a whole bunch of different things and sharing it all and I highly recommend doing this so you can try as much as you possibly can. Some favorites I really enjoyed were the Dishoom Calamari, Masala Prawns, House Black Daal, & Chicken Tikka were all great. Save some room for dessert and get the Kulfi or Cinnamon Ice Cream. 
Service was quick and the food comes out fast! Can't beat that!",1
5,We came for breakfast. Delicious. Will definitely be back. Prices are reasonable. A good mix of fusion dishes as gringo friendly stuff.,1
5,"Dishoom serves up some of the best Indian food I've ever had. The mango lassi. My god. Maybe it was dehydration from walking around all day, but nothing was better than mango lassi at that particular moment. Smooth, creamy, dare I say... mangoey? 
We tried a number of dishes, but the stand out was most certainly the grilled lamb chops. The flavor was on point - perfectly grilled and topped off with pomegranate seeds. The naan was warm and fluffy and the coleslaw served as a perfect cool down when necessary. I wouldn't have changed anything we ordered, except perhaps add on a tandoori chicken because I got major food envy looking at the table next to ours. 
I'd recommend making a reservation if possible, but if you end up waiting, you have to queue up outside. They come outside with drinks to keep you happy, but it looks a bit miserable especially if it's freezing cold outside.",1
5,"Very impressed with the food !! It was flavorful , delicious and I loved the size of the portions , great for sharing !!!!  Recommend trying the Ruby chicken and the lamb kebabs . The lamb is so tender it literally melts in your mouth. As for cocktails the chilitini is the the best cocktail I have ever had !!!! A must try is you like something semisweet , refreshing with a spicy kick at the end. Cannot wait to come back and eat here again.",1
4,"This is great value and excellent non-alcoholic options if you want to be healthy.
Go for breakfast and try an egg naan and chai coffee.
But it comes alive in the evening with a selection of sharing food and a mango lassi.
I could go here once a week and not get bored.",1
3,"There were six of us which afforded us the luxury of reserving a table in advance. But even calling a month ahead only got us a reservation at 18:00!
Nevertheless, I digress. 
We were seated in the dark lower level. Nice low lighting for an intimate dinner but it made for difficult reading of the menu. We managed to order a wide selection of food which was all delicious. Highlights were the tender lambchops, calamari, gunpowder potatoes, cheese toasts and the briyanis. The chutneys were also very good. 
The service felt pushy. They told us they needed our table back in 2 hours which was fine but the meal felt very rushed. They had us in and out in less than an hour. We ordered some samosas which arrived while we were still placing our order since it was being relayed wirelessly back to the kitchen.  Really? They couldn't wait until the waitress left our table to start bringing food out? I also felt the waitress was trying to suggestively upsell us along the way - would you like a lassi? Maybe a saucier dish to go with your meal? A trip to the loo also meant being accosted by staff and being herded in the right direction rather than being politely asked if I needed help.  I relayed this all back to the manager via email who was apologetic about the experience.
I really enjoyed the food but the experience was not relaxing as the service was too in your face. The Shoreditch branch does a much better job in the delicate balancing act of turning tables and delivering a good service experience. The food serves 4 stars but the service really brings it down to 3.",-1
5,"Dishoom is downright delicious.
I'm told this place is an authentic Bombay cafe which I can't yet verify. It doesn't matter. The food is excellent. The trademark black daal (£4.90) and chicken ruby (£8.20), neither of which shied away from flavor or spice, left me both full and wanting more. There was probably cocaine in both of them. I don't know that I care. These are mandatory for a first time order.
The decor is neatly upscale and the staff was courteous to me as a solo diner in line with what one would expect based on the decor and the prices.
There is only one significant downside to Dishoom: if it ever was a secret, the secret is out. Expect to wait. At 10:45pm on a Friday night for a solo diner I still waited 15 minutes. I walked by a few times and saw lines out the door. Be prepared.
Dishoom, when are you expanding internationally? Please...?",1
4,Great style and a lot of fun. Wide range of Indian cooking and great for breakfast!,1
4,"I tried the black dall (very good), Biryani chicken -wish if the rice was cooked a bit more- and the Kulfi Mango, i have no complaints overall.
A real good restaurant with a fine atmosphere",1
2,"This place's high rating makes me think only tourists with terrified palates use Yelp in London. Dishoom looks trendy, but the food is flavorless. The waiter recommended the prawn Koliwada starter. It was heavy and flavorless. Lamb Awadhi biryani had literally no flavor. The kachumber was an insult to the name; instead of finely chopped cukes, tomatos, and onions with some spice and lemon, it was literally a bowl of giant pieces of unseasoned raw red onion with a few bits of tomato and cucumber thrown in. Inedible and gross. The signature prawn moilee curry was just OK, but given that it tasted a bit like something, it was the standout of the meal. All this, and the prices are quite high. Twenty pounds a head for lunch will buy you lovely Indian food at about a thousand places in London.",-1
5,"This place was incredible. Simply incredible. And the food was halal!
Coming to London, we knew we had to have good Indian food at least once during our short stay. After trying Dishoom, we ended up coming back for a second visit. It was that good!
We tried a lot of different things on the menu and nothing disappointed. What stands out in my memory was the cranberry biryani and the rose lassi. 
Please come to America, Dishoom. Please!",1
4,"I've heard so much about Dishoom both on Yelp and through colleagues.  We finally organised a work dinner (score!) one night and I wasn't feeling too great but still dragged myself there.  I'm so glad I went even and fought through it.  Definitely worth it.  Now, the people I went to dinner with are Dishoom regulars and seemed to know what to order.
They recommend having about 2 dishes per person.  It's like Indian tapas and it's meant to be shared.  We all threw out a few things from each and most of it was really good.
Chili Cheese Toast - This was good but nothing too spectacular.  
Keema Pau - This was good - order extra bread because what they give you isn't enough.
Vada Pau - Much better than the Keema one!  Yum!
Chicken Tikka - So good!  The seasoning was great and it was so juicy and tender.
Paneer Tikka - This was good but would've preferred another order of the Chicken Tikka instead!
Masala Prawns - Definitely one of the best dishes.  It packed a good spicy punch.  
Lamb Biryani - This was good but nothing fantastic
House Black Daal - Definitely the top dish for me.  
I didn't see the bill but thinking you'd probably spend more here than your average place. The atmosphere is cool, not too uptight but nice and relaxed at the same time.",1
5,"I had a good experience here.  The wait was set at 1hr 20min but I got into the bar area (got the (Viceory's Old Fashion) maybe 25min later.  And then I was seated 10min later.  Service is great and they are a well oiled machine.  
Everything I ordered was really good.  I got the garlic naan, the Chicken Tikka, Ocra fries, lamb samosas, and the Black House Daal.  The food that stood out for me the most was actually the Dishoom Calamari.
I'll be back when I return to London.",1
4,"Lunch for six on 9/27/13. Really enjoyed the variety and theme of the restaurant. A place to get Katee rolls and Frankie's?  We were in heaven. Food hit the mark however service was a little off. We ordered the chicken and pomegranate salad but it was nicer delivered to the table. We had to remind them that it didn't come so that they could take it off the check. We ordered the rajma chawal for our kids so it came out first. When they delivered our food, they brought out a second rajma chawal which we didn't ask for. They took it back. 
A good concept of Indian street food in a refined setting. They take reservations until 6pm only.",1
4,"Dishoom has an interesting concept that I have not seen in the US.  It's an Indian tapas restaurant with a specialty in grilled meats.  The entrees are meant to be shared. The restaurant has a nice clean casual ambiance on the first floor and a more intimate dining experience downstairs.
We visited Dishoom on two different occasions and both visits were exceptional.  We tried the following: Lamb Boti Kebab, Spicy Lamb Chops, Chicken Malai, Chicken Tikka Roll, Seekh Kebab and Keema Pau.  Each dish has its own unique, distinct taste and made an excellent marriage between the food and wine.
On our second visit, the owner selected our table for the ""Rules of the Matka"" which means if you roll the dice and get a 6 then they will cover your tab. So of course, the dice rolls and we leave with a wonderful meal on the house!  
The owner and service staff were all great and made our last day in London memorable.",1
5,"I love Dishoom (but not that they don't take reservations nor that they're always crazy busy). 
But logistical complaints aside, the food is excellent. One of my missions in my London life is to find a source for excellent lentils (why is that so hard?!), and Dishoom's black lentils are by far my favorite so far. Thick, rich, creamy, spicy. And only £4.95/order. I could happily sit down with a pot of that and some naan and gorge myself any day of the week.
They also have a breakfast/brunch service, which I have yet to try. I suspect that when I persuade them to serve their lentils with poached eggs, they'll never be able to keep me away...
Overall, a great place for Indian dinner in the heart of Shoreditch. You should go there, it's worth it.",1
5,"Tried this restaurant after a lot of recommendations. It was a pleasant lunch, service was amazing and the manager kept asking of everyone is well. Food wise it was tasty and quite reasonably priced. I definitely recommend coming, beware during lunch time it does get very busy.",1
5,"this was me and Justin B's first meal on our London vacay and we definitely got our trip off to a great start by having dinner at Dishoom! it's located right in the middle of all the convent garden shops and restaurants. we showed up early at like 530pm on a friday night and there was already a queue for an hour wait! we figured that this place had to be good so we waited outside patiently as a queue formed behind us. they have such an organized line system - first wait outside, then sit inside as waiting areas open up, then transition downstairs to the bar as space opens up there so an hour wait isn't that painful.
we ordered a couple of cocktails and a calamari appetizer in the bar area to wet our appetite and then we were seated for dinner in the downstairs dining room. everything on the dinner menu sounded so good so we ordered a little bit of everything haha. the dishoom chicken tikka was so good and the meat had such a nice grilled flavor to it! the chicken ruby curry was super flavorful and rich! the only miss for me was the kacchi lamb biryani only b/c it was a bit too spicy for me...and the black house daal (lentils) was probably my favorite dish of the night! of course we ordered garlic naan to sop up all the extra sauce for the dishes too. sooo much food but it was soo good! probably the best Indian food that i've ever had. this place definitely isnt cheap since all the dishes add up fast, but its worth the splurge!",1
4,"So good, I love this restaurant. It's not cheap but it's worth it. Whenever friends come to visit and I wanna take them somewhere special and consistently good this is always the number 1 choice.",1
5,"The BEST Indian food and FANTASTIC service! We were visiting from Los Angeles to celebrate my mom's bday. Our server Arlind was so helpful and attentive. The manager very sweetly checked on us. When it came time for dessert, Arlind kindly gathered all the attractive servers to gather and sing happy birthday with so much spirit! We had such a blast! Truly made our trip special. We will definitely be back!! Thanks again!",1
4,"Very solid wonderful not too cheap (but not too expensive) Indian food bang in the centre of town. It should be crap. It is not.
It's a little bit twee but the food is just wonderful - from the lassi (skip the mango and go for the salted) down to the sides, everything's just fabulous. Go for it.",1
4,"The food is great! The lineup to get the food sucks! Lol I guess because they're so good there's always a lineup at the door.  I guess you can try to beat the line by getting there early.  We arrived around 7 and waited until 830.  Thing is, once you go inside.. There's more waiting!!!! It's ludicrous!  I wonder if the place would be as busy if it was raining and people didn't want get wet.
One great thing is that while lining up, they do provide you with hot drinks.  Some hot appetizers would've been nice too.. That way we're not starving for 1.5 hrs.  My husband had to go buy some food to tie him over lol.
Once inside the food smells intoxicating and all you want to do is eat everything.  Maybe that's they're plan... Make you wait so long that their food is amazing no matter what! But I doubt it... The food was pretty amazing.  Definitely get the naan and grilled fish and gravy! Would go back again even if we have to wait! But that's why there's no 5 stars because of the wait lol!",1
4,"A really nice place for feel and ambience, eg the look and feel of an Indian train station from 120 years ago. The wait for a table was long, 40 mins at the bar and finally we got a table. The service was efficient and the food was ok, not really Indian, more 'irani cafe in Bombay indian', or what people think indian is?. I did enjoy the entire dining experience but that is what its all about, the experience , not just the food or drink",1
4,"The service was impeccable and super slick. 
The food was nice, but did not blow me away.",1
5,"First good meal I had in London. Everything was good. Chicken tiki, chicken ruby, spicy lamb chops just to name a few. 
The wait is kind of a pain, but the hosts are really nice.",1
4,"Location- excellent! steps away from Leicester square and covent garden.
Food- delicious, the problem becomes you want to order everything on the menu.
Price- good for such nice restaurant.
Chai tea- Love!!! lovee loveee!!!!
The only thing I do not like about the restaurant is the wait. They do not take reservations for dinner...so most of the time you need to wait outside for more than an hour. 
I would definitely go back still but maybe at the odd hours to avoid long line up!",1
5,The food was delicious and reasonably priced. I had the mahi tikka which was tender and moist along with the cheesy naan and a mango lassi that was very refreshing.  We also ordered raita for the table which was a pretty large side and refreshing with the curries. My friends had the black daal and the chicken ruby and they loved both as well. I also was able to try my friend's rose and cardamom last and it was delicious. The service was great and they let us sit at the table as we waited for our other friends to arrive instead of giving up the reservation. I recommend going at lunch to beat the crowd and cannot wait to return and try many of the other dishes on their menu.,1
5,You really can't go wrong here. Yes it's Indian food done to great satisfaction but the usual kitschy decor is no where to be found. Instead there is a comfortable and modern vibe that is very tranquil. I had the chicken tikka and it was flavorful and hot. The black daal was equally delicious. Over its a 9/10 for me,1
5,"Worth the line. Pretty cute hip place and also really really delish. We tried lots of little things and each was better than the last. 
We also waited in line outside in winter for like 30 mins. This felt a bit nutty, but it was worth it. I wouldn't say this about too many places! 
Good for dates and good for a group of 4 but not much larger groups. It's loud and a bit hard to hear.",1
4,"Great food, reasonable food prices.
I am just annoyed by the mandatory ""queue ; (expensive) bar ; food"" trap. It is obviously part of the business model to ""suggest you"" to have a drink while waiting for a table...",1
3,"This place was recommended by some locals so we wanted to try this while in London.  We went to the Covent Garden location in a cold November evening, and had to stand outside to wait for a table.  While standing out in the cold, the staff brought out hot chai teas for all of us, which was already a wonderful touch.  The queue moved rather quickly, so we were seated in about 30 minutes.  The decor inside was quite cool, with Aalto pendant lamps and all.
The food was good.  Definitely no complaints, but there was nothing I could remember that was amazing.  Yeah.",-1
5,"I left so caffeinated from the unlimited chai. It was really good, great service.Even my friend who doesn't like Indian food was happy with her food. We went for breakfast before going to shop and see museums in the area. Highly recommend.",1
4,"The food here is very good and the prices are reasonable. I was pleased with the portion size and the quality of the meats used in the food. I was disappointed in the small size of the Mango Lasi and the naan bread. One of the things a I love about naan in the UK is that it normally comes in a huge piece. The naan served here is about the size of a normal tortilla cut in half. 
The seating was good and the service was also good. We go here right at 6pm and we were so lucky we only had to wait 40 minutes. When we left the queue was down the block. 
We had the vegetable curry paneer, the chicken tikka , and the chicken ruby. All of these dishes were superb, and the flavors were great. We also had garlic naan as well as the house slaw. Make sure to order a side of rice for the table as the curry can be spicy. We were excited to eat here and were glad we waited.",1
5,"Now I know why the national dish of England may be Chicken Tikka Masala. After asking the waiter, what is good here?"" He replied, everything on the menu. If you order something and it is not to your liking, I will buy you and your friends a round of drinks. Needless to say, we bought all of our own drinks that night. 
Highlights include Lamb Raan, Calimari, and Garlic Naan. 
Trendy, chic, and a smorgasbord of radness",1
5,"I'm not going to write how great dishoom is or how long the wait might be (read the below reviews, you will get the point). I think what is good about dishoom that your waiter might not mention is that the dishes are larger than regular tapas so if you're a group of 3 and thinking of ordering 9 dishes, you might be overdoing it. Think of each dish as shareable between 2 people as taste tasting and order accordingly.",1
4,"Entrance:
Arrived around 8pm on a Saturday without a reservation. We were told the wait would be around an hour, but as there was no space at the bar downstairs yet, we had to queue outside. There wasn't any option to leave our name and return later either. 
This was by far the most entertaining queue I'd been in. First, they brought out hot milk tea for all of us. Then, the guy at the door asked us if we wanted to see some magic. He did a few tricks (found a card we picked, made a lighter disappear - this was particularly amusing as the lighter fell out of his sleeve a moment later) and while far from the best, his personality combined with the tricks made it very entertaining. 
Shortly after, we were let into the bar area. 
Bar:
Managed to get some stools at the corner so we were comfy. There isn't much space at the bar area so I can see why they were full. Tried the dishoom ipa and thoroughly enjoyed it. We also ordered lamb samosas and calamari. The samosas were excellent but pricey for the portion (2 pieces for 4.2 pounds). 
Food:
We ordered the Murgh Malai Chicken, Roomali Roti, Black Daal, Chicken Berry Brittania Biryani, and Raita. This order was just nice for 2 people (we actually doubled up on this as there were 4 of us).
Everything was amazing! My one complaint might sound a bit weird but it's that the carb:protein ratio in the biryani felt a bit skewed towards protein. It might be because we added an additional chicken dish as well but it just felt like the dish as a whole was getting overpowered by the meat. I solved the problem for myself by giving some extra chicken to one of my friends. And I imagine for most people this won't really be a cause for complaint.
Service:
Prompt, attentive, friendly. And this covers everyone from the door to the bar to the table. Loved our server in particular. He was incredibly high energy.
Dessert:
I had the Mango Kulfi and tried a bite of the chocolate mousse. Tasty but nothing special. A slight let down given the high quality of the mains.
Overall:
Loved it! Already looking forward to the next visit. As I'm writing all this, I'm not even sure myself why I'm not giving it a 5. It just seemed to fall short somewhere (though I'm not sure where), but this is definitely at the top end of a 4 for me. (I really need yelp to be out of 10...)",1
4,"Really good: chicken berry Britannia, masala prawns, Murgh malai. Good: spicy lamp chop, kingfisher. Ok: house black daal, bhang lassi. Can be better(good taste, but its not warm/crispy enough; seems was pre-cooked and put there for a while): Lamb samosas. Good service",1
5,"Just fantastic food and service!!! Wait the 1.5 hours!!!! Wait. They take care of you even when you're waiting in line with great coffee, Indian tea etc...it's the place to go when you're in London",1
5,"I WANT TO EAT ALL MY MEALS HERE.
This place is amazing! I came here for brunch (I don't normally like burnch on Saturday because it means I have to get out of bed) with some out of town friends because I thought they should try brunch with a difference. We had a full English with a twist - it was all spiced with Indian inspired flavours. The eggs had a massals spicing and tasted divine, the sausage was locally sourced but obviously coated and cooked with some incredibly fragrant and aromatic spice mixture and even the beans came with a chilli twist. 
Yes it was expensive, £11.50. But it was worth it. And instead of a mimosa, I sampled a Dishoom breakfast cocktail - orange and grapferuit juices with a splash of Ophir gin, which is oriental in flavour and again fills your palette with the most incredible rush of floral flavours. 
Yes please!",1
4,"A much different indian experience ... fancy interior, fancy exterior and fancy location. The food was fantastic (Chicken Ruby was so incredibly tasty) and the desert was outstanding. 
Waiting staff is super friendly and provides an amazing experience. Is it worth the 90 minute wait in comparison to other Indian restaurants...not sure but if you can get in without the long wait, it is most certainly worth it.",1
3,"My friend took me to Dishoom in London calling it a restaurant which would hit very close to India. The reviews amongst Londoners I met prior to the meal were something along the lines of ""Best Indian restaurant"", ""Daal is to kill for"", etc., So with absurdly high expectations, we hit the restaurant at around 9:30 PM. Waited for 10 minutes and managed to get a spot at the bar with a further estimated wait time of 15 minutes for the actual table. At the bar, we ordered Okra fries and Samosa. 
Samosa - Tasted pretty much like Trader Joes frozen samosas heated up. 
Okra fries - Underwhelmed. No crispness to it. Favors didn't stand out either. 
After around 10 minutes of wait time, we got our table. I was willing to let go of the samosa and okra fries and give Dishoom a second chance. We ordered Vada Pav, Bhel Puri, Daal, Bread and Biryani.
Vada Pav - Good. Not a home run, but good. 
Bhel Puri - Disaster. Where are my chutneys?! Why am I eating this bland puffed rice? I mixed in the chutneys from the Samosa to save the day. 
Daal - Really really good. They got their signature dish right.
Biryani - I guess it was Kachi Biryani. Please don't tell me this is Dum. If I am trying to guess the biryani types, you know the biryani is in trouble. All I can say was it was some sort of curry rice. 
Outside of India, the restaurants worthy of mention are Himalaya in Houston, Texas, Vij in Vancouver, Canada, Rasika/Bombay Club in Washington DC, Indian Accent in New York. Dishoom is nowhere close. If I was in London, I would be visiting it yea, but not recommending it as the next best thing outside India.",-1
4,"Some of the best Indian food I've ever had! We waited over an hour to get seated, but I guess that's just bound to happen at a good restaurant in Central London. We were given some free ""naughty"" (read alcoholic) chais to start with. Then after about 30 minutes, we were sent down to the bar to hang out until our table was ready. For 7 of us, we ordered quite a bit of food and drink, and ended up paying about 19 quid per person.
Some of the dishes we ordered:
keema pau and vada pau - definitely preferred the keema of the two
paneer and mango salad - fresh with a nice kick to it, one of my favorites
house black daal - tasted great with the naan and roti
chicken berry britannia (biryani) - much spicier than expected, but still good
lamb boti kabab - a little dry for my taste
murgh malai - very tender, my favorite grill item
And loads of naan, roti, and rice. More than enough food. We probably could have taken out one of the biryanis (we ordered 2 of those), but a fantastic meal overall. They do take reservations, but it probably has to be days in advance. We tried a few hours before and they weren't accepting any more.",1
5,"Made a quick trip to London while I was in Europe and was determined to try this place after reading all the reviews. I had really high expectations coming in and they were definitely all met! We got the black daal, chicken ruby, lamb biryani, garlic naan, okra fries and they were all sooooo well seasoned and delicious. We came around 7 and the wait was an hour and 20 minutes but we were seated after 40 minutes which was great. They also served free chai and mint teas since the weather was a little chilly outside. This place made me wish I lived in London because I would probably come every week!!",1
5,"Long wait so go prepared for that or make a reservation. However, the food and service is worth the wait. The review of others were accurate and recommendations good. We also ordered an amazing martini and the Bombay version of pina colada, both were excellent.",1
4,"Finally came to eat here after rave reviews - we were the first in the queue outside (arrived at 5:25) but within 5mins there were 10ppl behind us. We ended up only waiting half an hour - got to wait in the bar inside so weren't left in the cold for too long although I know of people who've waited over an hour in the queue outside.
I had the Bangha Lassi - absolutely delicious! Could be a dessert tbh. Also had some chai tea, which was nice but doesn't compare to the real stuff (if you've been to India).
I'd always heard that Dishoom was ""affordable"" but I honestly thought it was quite pricey considering I got 5 little pieces of lamb kabab - however it was tasty. The calamari and prawn koliwada were probably my favourite dishes. Also the Malai Kulfi and the Pineapple and Pepper desserts were pretty amazing!
Best bet is to be in the queue by 5:30pm latest so you only wait between 30-45mins",1
4,"Lovely food! Their black lentils are what made me actually like lentils again! Definitely try their cinnamon icecream too, it is light, creamy and full of delicious cinnamon flavour. My only qualm is that you can only book for 6 or more people.",1
5,"Excellent alternative to the amazing and expensive Amaya at a fraction of the price. What I ordered:
PAU BHAJI (VERY GOOD)
A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered pau bun, Chowpatty Beach style. No food is more Bombay. (V)3.90
MURGH MALAI (SIMPLY AMAZING. YOU HAVE TO ORDER IT)
Chicken thigh meat is steeped overnight in garlic, ginger, coriander stems and a little cream. Still slightly pink when fully cooked. (M)7.50
SPICY LAMB CHOPS ( I DIDNT LIKE THEM. BUT YOU MIGHT)
They lie overnight in a special marinade of lime juice and jaggery, warm dark spices, ginger and garlic. 11.90
BIRYANI. (WE LOVED IT)
CHICKEN RUBY (VERY GOOD)
A good and proper curry redolent with spice and flavour. Tender chicken in a rich silky 'makhani' sauce, best mopped up with a Roomali Roti. 8.20
SHEEKH KABAB ( VERY GOOD. A BIT DRY THO)
Minced lamb is marinated with lime, coriander and cumin, then grilled. 7.90
All in all. I would go there any time. Excellent food",1
5,"A beautiful restaurant. Very clean. The staff and Managment is extremely knowledgable of their food and menu. The best Chicken Tikka Masala ""Chicken Ruby"" I've ever had. And the Pistachio Kulfi is a wonderful dessert. A very clean restroom. Oh and they play traditional Indian music",1
5,"This review is from November of 2015. I am from the states and I am still dreaming of Dishoom. Take my review for what it is; as I do not think enough adjectives can describe just how fantastic my meal here was. If I visited Dishoom in the earlier part of my trip, I would've been a regular throughout my entire stay(I went twice during my last two days in London). Absolutely fantastic service, delicious food(the garlic naan and the black daal...!!! Incredible.) a wonderful staff. At first I thought they were just treating me well since I was a solo diner, but no--this service was beautifully delivered in a non-transactional way to all guests in the dining room. Dishoom, you deserve the utmost applause--fantastic service and a fantastically consistent product!",1
5,"Everytime I travel internationally (or even domestic for that matter) I make a point of trying Indian restaurants, as it is one of my favorite foods. We were recommended Dishoom by many locals and had also heard of the amazing breakfast here as well (we'll try that next time.) We came for dinner and I am happy to say that this meal will go down in the Top 3 I have ever had in my life. To compare, a few days before we went to the MOST rated Indian restaurant on Yelp in London, Tayyabs. These places really don't even compare, Tayyabs felt like the Applebee's version of Indian compared to Dishoom. Yes, Tayyabs food was very good, but the service was terrible and the menu is fairly simple in regards to variety in dishes and we were all having flashbacks to Thursday nights at Applebee's in the style of service and menu.
Dishoom creates a unique experience from the start and the food is an incredible fusion of retro bombay in the imperial times. If that makes sense, or if it doesn't, just go here and you won't be disappoainted.",1
4,"Been here a few time for breakfast. Great food, fast service, and the bottomless chai is killer",1
4,"I came into today for lunch needing to get some Indian food on this short trip to London. A couple quick notes: 
 (1) I've never been to Bombay & have no real idea what a Bombay Café is, but I do know Dishoom had a great vibe/atmosphere going
 (2) When it comes to Indian food I'm one of those, ""let's try the tikka masala"" people. Sad but true.
Sitting down, my server was patient with me and made some great recommendations:
 - Sheekh Lamb - really enjoyed this
 - Dhaba Chicken - nothing I would have ever ordered, but I was glad he threw the special at me - very good
 - Naan - only negative was the Naan wasn't warm when it got to me, but they did have a couple 12 tops clogging things up.
Ultimately, this is 3.5 restaurant, but the service rounded it up for me. Worth coming in if you're in the neighborhood. Not sure I'd make a special trip to come here.",1
5,Excellent food. Very cool concept. Amazing Indian food. Great service. Busy but worth waiting. Will be back if I get to visit London again.,1
5,"As good as the prior 200 reviewers said. Went with the house specials: Chicken Tikka, Black Daal, Garlic Naan, and Dishoom IPA. Perfect meal. I sat next to the service counter and watched the exec chef study every dish that went out. A couple dishes were sent back to the kitchen... There's one reason this place is so good! Quality control at the last step.",1
4,"Excellent food, nice atmosphere, attentive staff. 
Forgive the generalisation, for mere simplicity I would describe the rich creamy food as Northern Indian. 
I tried both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes and I was really impressed.
Fresh ingredients make for tasty authentic food.
Not to miss.
Only warning the queue outside. Come before 6pm, or with a group (reservation possible for parties of six or more).",1
5,"Great Indian food! Would certainly visit again.
Decided to drop by during the week around 1:30PM without a reservation. Showed up at the place and hostess informed me that a wait can be up to 50 minutes for 2 people. However if there's space at the bar, we can sit there first. The hostess was friendly and efficient and made you feel welcomed.
So we waited about 20-30 minutes and we were able to get a table on the ground floor. We ordered the kebab, lamb chops, chicken curry, garlic naan, and rice to share. The wait staff was average, did their job and had no issues. 
The food were delicious and I would try other dishes the next time I visit! Would certainly visit again, however if I had to wait outside for 1+ hours in the cold, I wouldn't. Try to visit during non-peak hours.",1
5,"Best Indian food of my life. I don't even know where to start, but whatever, here I go. 
Found this place online and saw that it had really, really good reviews so I was intrigued. At first I tried to make a reservation on OpenTable but it was booked solid for the next WEEK so I took matters into my own hands and power walked to the place at 5:45pm on a Sunday. Even then, there was about a 20-person line out the door -- but it moved fast. 
After about 15 minutes in line, we got seats at the bar and I ordered a Bombay Colada, my sister ordered a virgin one, and my mom ordered a Gin Fizz. Prices were reasonable but on the expensive side -- BUTTT they were well worth their prices which is very rare. I watched the bartender as he made our drinks, and I kid you not, it was like watching a skilled artisan making artisanal goods. I was very impressed, and this was even before I had tasted my drink. It was AMAZING. So amazing that I didn't even care that there was practically zero alcohol content; it was all about the flavors. It was like the rum was just there to sweeten the drink. (I had a sip of my sister's virgin version and while it was good, it was lacking a little something-something, i.e. cane sugar via rum.)
Just as we were finishing our drinks, as if it were clockwork, our table was ready. (SIDE NOTE: I haven't talked at all about the decor, but it was pretty great too. Super cozy and warm, but also quirky and modern with lots to look at. The main dining area is on the first floor where there is an open kitchen you can peak in to watch your food being prepared, and then the bar and additional seating is downstairs in the basement -- which one would think would be a bit more second-class, but it was NOT. In fact, I was kind of hoping for a table downstairs instead of upstairs because it just seemed so cozy and everyone looked so jolly.)
Anyway, back to the food. Once we were seated at our table, we were greeted by our lovely server Praveen (sp?) who was friendly and welcoming, and extremely helpful in walking us through the menu. We ended up ordering vegetable samosas, Pau Bhaji, the house Chicken Tikka, Rajma-Chawal, house Black Daal, Roomali Roti, and some good ole garlic naan. Now I am going to spare you from my pathetic descriptions of these foods I can barely pronouce, but I will tell you this, everything was DELICIOUS. Everything. There was not one thing we ordered (we shared everything) that I did not like. Everything was the perfect amount of spicy, and all the flavors were rich and tasty. I'm Pavlov dogging right now just thinking about it. Ugh. I want to go back. Also, the food came out very quickly, and more or less all at once, which was awesome because I was starving.
We ate a shit ton of food, and were certainly full, but the thought of skipping out on desert after enjoying every SINGLE thing we had ordered just seemed ludicrous. We did not want to miss out. Each of us got a Chai tea, and then we split a bowl of cinnamon ice cream (sooo rich and creamy) and a pistachio Kulfi -- I had no idea what the latter was, and still don't fully..., but it was so delicious/rich/creamy/yum. Kind of like a cross between ice cream and a popsicle (it comes on a stick). Idk.
In conclusion, best indian food of my life. I miss it so much. And I will CERTAINLY be back each and every time I am in the UK. Will probably make a reservation next time though. 
PS, prices are very reasonable/affordable, staff is extremely hospitable, and the place is just not pretentious at all. Wide range of customers and EVERYONE seemed to be a happy camper/enjoying their dining experience.",1
2,"I have to confess to being bemused by the great fanfare that accompanies Dishoom. I hadn't heard of it, but love Indian food so was more than happy to give it a try for a dinner with a couple of friends. We pitched up at 7pm, were told that there was an hour wait. Happily I'd had an afternoon snack, so didn't mind waiting but it seems to me that if you're going to make people queue for an hour then you'd better make damn sure there's something worthy of that wait at the other end. 
We didn't get to sit down and order until about 830pm, with nothing but a small glass of chai tea (which I confess, tasted like it had been made from PG Tips) to sustain us in the interim. On the plus side, our waiter was attentive and helpful once we were seated, making recommendations about what to order, almost all of which we took. 
Between three of us, we had the Pau Bhaji, which set the tone for the rest of the food, being of a mushy consistency albeit quite tasty with the plain rolls with which it was served. We also ordered the Prawn Koliwada, which turned out to be the tastiest dish of the evening in my opinion. they didn't live up to the waiter's description of them as spicy, but they were very well seasoned, and delicious, with a decent number of prawns for a side dish served in a central London eaterie. The vegetable biryani was fine, comparable to what one might get in a decent local take out. the black dahl was surprisingly stingy with the lentils and had a taste that was slightly reminiscent of Heinz tomato soup (I kid you not). 
The biggest shocker (apart from the roti we ordered which came as a wafer thin bread that was impossible to scoop and eat with - I've eaten my fair share of roti and never seen anything like that) was Dishoom's Covent Garden Chef's Special, the Haleem, a 'revered dish that journeyed from Arabia to Hyderabad in the 19th century, and was there elevated to art form'. It was described on the menu as l lamb, cracked wheat, barley and lentils cooked for hours then pounded and served with a sesame onion seed naan and a garnish of green chillies, fresh ginger, fried onions and mint. 
What we got was greying mush that I have subsequently described to people (with no small degree of accuracy) as reminiscent of the nutrient goop that people have to eat in post-apocalyptic societies. It didn't really taste of much, particularly without the garnishes, and it was difficult to tell whether any animals were harmed in the making of this dish (if they were, it was an unworthy sacrifice). 
to top it off, the Bombay Pimms (""The classic English quencher gone native with saffron gin, mint, pomegranate, citrus and coriander. Fiery ginger beer, not 
lemonade"") I ordered tasted only of ginger beer, and not the fiery kind. 
Pleasant service and an exotic twist on the passing vogue for vintage interiors in no way make up for the crushing disappointment I experienced here. It's only the (slightly too noisy) ambience and the fact that the food wasn't bad so much as 'blah' that makes this a 2 rather than 1 star review. This is typical of the trend for taking cheap, tasty street food, prettifying it beyond all recognition (usually jettisoning taste at the same time) and then charging a bundle (the lamb goop was £16!) for the privilege. 
thanks, but no thanks - I'll be sticking to the bustling environs of Tooting or Southall in future.",-1
5,"Delicious. I am not very savvy with Indian food so I never really know what to get, but everything I have had here has been great. Highly recommend.",1
5,I have been to London 3 times in the past 6 months and I find myself at Dishoom each time. I love their Chicken Ruby and Samosas. Their Cheesy Nan is also delicious. Service is excellent from the queue all the way through paying your bill. Couldn't be more pleased.,1
5,"I have died and gone to Indian heaven! Everything from the courteous host, to the affable staff, to the amazing food was just perfect! Our waiter Joseph was incredibly helpful in helping us navigate the menu, and provided expert advice so that we optimized our menu choices and pairings.  
This might be the best Indian food I've ever had outside of India.  The chef is invintive in his use of traditional spices, and the dishes are perfectly portioned for sharing so that you can try a wide variety of offerings. 
This dining experience makes me regret that I am an out-of-town guest, as it is one that I wish I could repeat over, and over again.",1
5,All around outstanding. Extremely organized service. Our food was delicious and our waiter was beyond helpful. Ruby chicken was our favorite. Great place.,1
5,"There is always a long wait to get in here, but it's sooo worth it. The food and drinks are amazing as well as the atmosphere. Would recommend it to anyone.",1
5,"The food is amazing and the stuff is extremely friendly (very helpful, offering teas and chai latte while waiting as well as taking 2 of our small plates off the bill for waiting slightly longer!). I would strongly recommend it!",1
5,"Came here around 6pm and there was a line  of about 25 guest out the door. The person taking reservations told us it would be about 45 minutes. We opted for an outside table half way through our wait. They do give out hot tea to waiting guest though, so that's a plus.
We ordered the chicken ruby, black daal, shrimp, and garlic naan. The chicken ruby was my favorite, right amount of spice but not spicy at all. The daal was great but I could have used a touch more spice with it. Of course we had a delicious garlic naan bread to soap it up. 
I would definitely return, but come early. Oh yeah they only take reservations for groups of 6 or more.",1
5,"I've been to dishoom for the breakfast before and I wasn't disappointed. They had a very Creative take on the traditional English breakfast by giving it an Indian twist, full of spice and goodness. I heard its also good for dinner and lunch, but haven't had the chance to try it yet (queues can get Super Long). But hey, that's always a sign of good things right? Will try to beat the queue next time, remember to try their chai tea as well!",1
5,"The food was outstanding, I wanted to stay all night to try everything on the menu. There was a mix up with our reservation but the staff went above and beyond to make sure we got a table immediately, despite the long line. The excellent service continued inside and you quickly realize this place is extremely well managed. Highly recommended!",1
3,"It was good but honestly I am just as down with Punjab, where you can make a reservation and NOT wait in line for 45 minutes.",-1
2,"I feel like I'm the only person in London who doesn't really ""get"" Dishoom.
The decor is cool. It has a neat, sort of vintage speakeasy kind of feel to it. The dining experience here definitely beats the kitschy, 1980's living room atmosphere I'm used to with mom-and-pop Indian joints back home. Service was totally fine as well.
The food though. Ultimately, for me it doesn't matter how cool a restaurant looks if the food isn't up to snuff. I stopped in for lunch one day after reading all of the reviews. I just don't.. get it. We got the chicken tikka, the lamb with rice, and some garlic naan. It was tasty, don't get me wrong, but really not life-changing in my mind. It made me a little depressed to shell out the Central London premium when the bill came, knowing that there are better and cheaper alternatives in East London.
Not a hater, but not exactly a fan either. I just found it to be wildly overrated. To each his own, I guess.",-1
5,"Honestly my experiences with Indian food is limited, but the place really sets the standards enormously high; although it's hard to actually have a conversation in one of the most busy restaurants in London, it doesn't even matter because the food is so delicious that you simply forget to converse. I've been there twice and will be coming back every time I travel to London, and will recommend every friend I've got to do the same exactly thing!",1
2,"I was really disappointed when I came here. It came to me so highly recommended by so many people that I went for my birthday. We were seated at a table downstairs and away from where most people sat, which of course happens but, I already felt like I was missing out on something.
When I ordered my food the waitress told me that I should really order her recommendations, and she sounded so passionate that I changed my order. But when the food arrived it was all a bit bland and it was more expensive than my original order.
I'll definitely come back here, just because so many people rave about it and the atmosphere upstairs seemed great and it's so close to where I work and live. However my first visit was really underwhelming.",-1
3,"Great indian/pakistani food but slightly pricey (especially the naans). There are better, tastier, and cheaper options like Tayyabs and Lahore Kebab House.",-1
4,"Setup/Concept: 5/5
Great interior space with the true feeling of an Indian cafe.With so many restaurants leaning towards a ""fancy atmosphere"", Dishoom does a great job with incorporating an above average dining room with a casual feel.
Service: 5/5
We received extremely attentive service from our waitress and she was also very informative when we asked for suggestions. 
Food: 4/5
The food was above average in taste but could have had a bit more of a punch. I have been around Indian/Pakistani restaurants my entire life and feel that although not the most traditional food, Dishoom does a good job of gaining respect in its own way. The dishes are well thought out and executed with care. I have a habit of trying multiple things to try so we ordered: vegetable samosas, pau bhaji, lamb chops, ruby chicken, lamb biryani, naan, garlic naan, rumali roti, chai, fresh lemonade, green tea, mango lassi, khoya kulfi, mango kulfi, and the guju chocolate dessert. 
Overall:
A must try if you are into Indian/Pakistan cuisine to give you a unique experience.",1
5,"Delicious, authentic Indian food. Highly recommend the breakfast menu, as well as the chocolate cake and chilli ice cream for dessert if that's available.
Expect a wait, although some of their locations do take reservations!",1
4,"Great food, slow service, and overpriced for the small portions. I would go back there just for the quality and taste!",1
4,"It's an experience more than food. 
There was long line on cold evening. Was told 90 mins wait (but got table in less than an HR) 
They served hot tea as we were standing which made waiting outside experience more like pub but with tea :-)
Overall decor is old style Iranian restaurant in old Bombay which is quite nostalgic. Menu is best of old time favorites to typical fast food in India. 
Overall food good. Lamb Boti was very good. Chicken ruby is mediocre. So is biryani.
But overall good experience.",1
4,"Dishoom makes me happy. Maybe it's just saying their name over and over again in my head with different emphases (emphasi?) lol. 
Anyways, I always have a great meal here and especially so when I'm with my famous writer-friend ;)  I have to say it gets a bit busy in this branch but the other Shoreditch one is easier to while away time in.
I do love the potatoes, even though they use too many coriander seeds (it's all about being seedy ground up!) and the daal is amazing. Best value of all though is the pau bhaji - a meal for just £3.90. Bo. Or 'Dishoom' I should say!",1
4,"Great breakfast, service, and reasonable prices. I prefer the seating area upstairs to the area downstairs. Prices are reasonable as well and a lot of great veggie choices. I'd like to come back here and try the lunch as the menu looks quite good! When I came I got the Bombay omelet which was very flavourful. I was still left a bit hungry after so perhaps get a side as well. Also- be sure to try the mint tea- so simple but goes so nicely with the flavours of the breakfast items. Will definitely return!",1
5,"Great place to go with a group of friends and share lots of dishes on the extensive menu. The cocktails are also worth working your way through! I have been for lunch and dinner both times were delicious, next time I want to try out the brunch as I have great things.
Tip- If possible try and sit in their outside area. It's a great little sun trap with quirky decor.",1
5,Amazing but be prepared to stand in line for over an hour. Get the chicken ruby. You won't regret it.,1
5,"Yum, yum, yum!
Strolling around Covent Garden, my friend and I were figuring out a place to eat.  Someone from back home recommended this place to me, and so we decided to try it. 
What we had:
+ Okra Fries
+ Keema Pau
+ Mango and Fennel Seed Lassi
+ Virgin Bombay Pina Colada
+ Vegetable Samosas
+ Cheese Naan
We chose to get small dishes so we could try a variety of food, and I am glad we did that.  All of the dishes were great.  Flavored with delicious seasoning, the okra fries were crispy and not greasy. Keema pau was a yummy meat dish.  Our drinks were flavorful and had a twist to them.  The vegetable samosas and cheese naan were also really good.
Overall, I would definitely come back here!",1
5,Awesome service and flavorful food.. Had a wait that was supposed to be 45 min to eat and 30 minutes to get inside to the bar. They came out with hot mint and chai tea to keep everyone warm. We made it to the bar in 20 minutes then was immediately seated for dinner. The menu is set up to order small plates (2-3 per person) . The waiter gave great suggestions. Must go to for Indian restaurant in London !,1
3,"I dont know how to feel about the Indian food I am getting in London.  Dishoom is good, but nothing all that special outside of what I have gotten at some of the places in NYC.  Perhaps I am being too picky?
I stopped by for lunch one day and got the chicken tikka and the black daal.  Both dishes were tasty with the chicken tikka being delightfully moist and the daal being smokey and creamy.  Definitely good food, but just not anything more than that.  I do not see any reason for this place to have lines of an hour or longer.  My Indian friend said check out Chutney Mary's in Chelsea.  I think thats my next stop.",-1
5,"Where else outside India can you find Wada Pau and Pau Bhaaji? Which place outside India can work so well as a teleporter and a time machine to take you instantaneously to the 1960s' Mumbai and Pune? Excellent food (including vegetarian options), wonderful ambience, admirable service. I recommend the vegetable biryani.",1
5,"Best Indian food I have ever had! We were only in London for 2 days and ate here twice. The chicken ruby with roti was amazing! Not at all greasy, like some I have had before. Must try!",1
4,"Went back in 2010 for the preview with M.L. and 2011about 3 times. The prawns were the most memorable to me as well as the roti. The decor and crowds were super chic, as far as I recall, and our time was always incredible. 
Great atmosphere. enjoy! 
a solid 4.5 stars for the memories. ;)",1
5,"#TriggsEatLondon continued with dinner at this wildly popular spot. Easy to see why. We were able to get a table for 4 at 5pm with only a short wait. By the time we left an hour later the restaurant was full and a solid line outside. Good service with attentive staff & willing to share open insights into menu. Nothing we ordered was disappointing. Okra fries. Lamb samosas. Wanted to try their version of chickentikka but one member of our party wasn't keen on spicy dishes & the waitress was able to help us head this off. Murgh malai & masala prawns were splendid, the char on the prawns particularly excellent. But stand out was the Ruby Chicken, a curry with melt in your mouth chicken. I also treated myself to one of their cocktails, the Bombay Pimms & can heartily recommend. £25 a head seemed reasonable for the range of dishes. And excellent service in what was becoming a very busy room. Look like a chain across London. Recommend a visit",1
5,"Really delicious indian tapas food!! A little on the pricier end, but for a special occasion definitely worth looking into. Just make sure to make reservations as the lines can get crazy.",1
4,"Three reasons to love Dishoom:
(1) The cool Bollywood-inspired name
(2) The reasonable prices for the location 
(3) The quality of the food 
No, this is not the best Indian restaurant in London. (That title goes to Montys in Ealing.) But it does what it does well and efficiently. Portions are right-sized. They have an efficient system by which to handle the steady flow of customers that contributes to the experience & atmosphere rather than detract. Service is very friendly... especially for the location / reputation. Prices are downright good for the location. Menu is limited in a way that suggests that they are more interested in making good dishes than in pleasing all.",1
3,"Busy place on a Friday evening in a bustling neighborhood. Saw the great Yelp reviews and stopped in for arguably my fav ethnic cuisine. First impression is that it's a bit more Westernized (and full of white people) than the places I usually frequent. Open mind nonetheless!
All I can say is the veggie samosas are among the best I've encountered. Flaky, potato-y, peppery, hearty, and perfectly spiced. Wow. Pairs like a champ with the tamarind chutney. And def go for the veggie version -- the lamb simply doesn't work as well.
Ordered the chefs special Haleem, which arrived at the table surprisingly quickly. Creamy lentil base offered some contrast with the spice-rich additions, yet the depth simply wasn't there. And I found the plain naan a superior match to the included poppy-onion naan. Solid, yet unremarkable overall. And certainly not worth £16.50.
Going with 3* here since 3.5 isn't available and I suspect this place is overrated. Based on my limited (read: singular) experience, I'd venture elsewhere for truly great Indian cuisine. But if you're in the area, pop in for an order or two of veggie simosas: you won't be disappointed.",-1
5,"This might be my all-time favorite Indian-inspired restaurant.  Stopped here twice (Nov 2012), for lunch and the following day for a late-night post-theatre dinner.  Excellent, flavorful meals on both occasions, ample portions.  For dinner, I started off with a Mumbai-style pau bhaji, a vegetable curry (bhaji) with a toasted, buttered piece of bread (pau).  This was followed by a main course of 5 dishes: Dishoom 'slaw, a creamy kachumber salad with cabbage, cucumbers, onions and  tomato; house black daal; a South Indian chicken curry, Chicken Ruby (Ruby Murray = Cockney rhyming slang for curry); one Roomali Roti, paper-thin roti bread; and steamed Basmati rice.  It was more than I could handle, but I somehow put it all away.  To top it off, I ordered the chocolate chai.",1
4,Great experience and food. Good luck in getting a table!,1
5,Addicted.  We went several times during our stay in London.  We're still talking about the daal and briyani.  We'll be back.,1
4,"Bear out the wait! It's never as long as they say, and worth it for the free chai (dirty if you are lucky). If there is a place in Central London I like to eat in more, I haven't found it. Having loved and lived in Mumbaj it makes me nostalgic for lunch and dinner dates in Cafe Britannia and other Parsi cafés. 
If you or members of your group aren't used to eating Indian food, this is a great introduction with something for everyone. I've brought family, friends, and dates. Kick it off with a cocktail, all are good, but I especially recommend an off the menu item called the 'Dhoble' (Dub-lay; named after Mumbai's infamous Polic Commissioner)- just ask them to ask the bar staff.
I'm a big fan of the pau bhaji/bhel/vada pau for starters. Highly recommend the Biryani or Bhoti kabobs for mains. No order will be complete without the house Black Daal (my Keralan GF adores it). Remember it's easier and cheaper to share- most dishes can serve two. Mop it all up with a roomali roti (handkerchief roti- ask to see them make it, it's epic).
Truthfully dessert isn't as strong as the rest. Go for the kulfi on a stick. Chai is too small a portion in my opinion, coffee is fine but not done in traditional pulled fashion. Just grab cocktail 2 or 3 instead :)
I'd be surprised if it comes to more than £30pp :)",1
5,"One of the best Indian restaurant I ever was!
Food Is delicious and the staff really friendly. I would recommend a reservation before coming since you might have to stand in line outside waiting.",1
5,"If you had chicken ruby from this place, you would be dreaming about it for a while. Chicken is tender, sauce consists of mix of various spices. I wish I could go back for dinner tonight. Little far from our home, Hawaii.",1
4,"Getting there at 6 the wait was only about half an hour for dinner and you could make it down to the bar - I would not have wanted to be one of the people queuing when we left!
I got special treatment as it was my birthday which is always nice and the food was awesome. I was facing the kitchen so can't say much about the decor but love the atmosphere - chilled out and friendly, no pretension here.
Prices are also great for the area and the food is top notch. The naan bread was beautiful and I think my friend and I might now be addicted to the far far away.
Will definitely be back to check out the breakfast!",1
5,"Delicious food and great atmosphere.
Book ahead or put your name down for a small wait - it's worth it! The staff were great at keeping us informed about wait times and such. They even brought out warm mint tea as the cool evening crept in. 
Highlights for us were the pau bhaji entree which was a bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered sweet bread, and the house black daal which was a small pot of lentil awesome. The garlic naan was also delicious, sprinkled with the right amount of fresh garlic and coriander. Yum!",1
5,"It took two attempts before we could grab a table. Dishoom does not accept reservations unless for parties of 6 or more. Your best bet is to arrive before 6pm to get a table, otherwise, it is an average of an hour for a table. There is a small bar section downstairs while you wait for a table. The vibe here is full of energy! 
Pimms lemonade and lukosowa cocktail was the poison of the evening -- they were very refreshing for the spicy food that was to come. For London, the price on the cocktail was rather reasonable.
For the food, we decided to do a tasting sample. Be sure you ask for the heat index, we didn't and got ourselves into a pinch half way through dinner. The dome oven was broken, so that was a bummer. Most dishes are appetizer size, so you'll need about 2- 3 dishes per person. But, don't let the waiter influence your decision, order as you go along.
Garlic Naan: crispy and packed with garlic, you almost don't taste the bread. It's a garlic lover's dream come true!
Bhel: we were a little surprised by this rice cracker dish which has the texture of rice crispy cereal providing for a neat texture. Don't be fooled by the berries, you'll gonna need that sweetness once the heat hits - it gets you at the back of your throat.
Chicken Berry Biryani: curry chicken, slow cooked, served over rice and a full serving. This was a great medium heat dish.
Vada Pau: spiced potato and chutney in a bun. Two buns per order. One bit per bun. 
Dhaba Chicken: curry chicken that was a bit too spicy, a rather small serving.
Mago & Fennel Lassi: cold refreshing drink to help cool your mouth.  This is yogurt based. 
Half way through the meal, my mouth was on fire.  Another waitress saw me starting to swell up as I tried in vain to wave cool air into my mouth. He brought over Raita, a cool cucumber yogurt sauce, on the house. It was a really nice gesture and did the trick. Shortly after, the house manager came by and asked if we needed any more bread, also on the house.  I was too embarrassed to say yes - however, very appreciative of their service.",1
4,"I love this place - the Covent Garden version seems less trendy than the Shoreditch place (quelle surprise!) but has the same yummy food and is therefore the sort of place where our eyes are always heaps bigger than our tummies so always end up having to lug lots of yummy food home (no real shame of course!) Also super good value and there are some yummy, well-made cocktails and lassis too!
The only real (slight) downside is that you can't book but even though the queue is always miles long, it always moves reasonably quickly because another benefit of the yummy street food is that it is made, served and gobbled up pretty fast!",1
5,"a MUST try~ 
I got this recommendation from a hall mate~ whose from India~ 
I really loved it. 
One of the waiters (who looked like a young Paul McCartney) was so nice~ BECAUSE...I was in charge of a goodbye lunch and did not make reservations for 10 people!! I was really nervous but he totally handled the situation and gave us a really lovely spot downstairs~ I would actually have my birthday here. I was quite please with the decor and how nice it was~
what i liked: 
1. ambiance (decor is nice) 
2. FOOD is awesome
3. must try the cheesy naan, and the chef's covent garden special, Daal, briyani and grilled prawns... 
TIP: i suggest family style~! the portions are SMALL. there i said it... BUT...if you have about 4 people and you order a selection of things from the menu you'll like this restaurant... if you order just 1 thing off... say the grill you might be disappointed..as some did in our group. 
TIP: they don't take reservations for dinner, but they do take reservations for lunch~ Just call ahead and see what's up and how they can accommodate you~",1
2,"I visited Dishoom with colleagues from work with our lovely Indian friend leading the way as he advises and suggests stuff to help us make the best decisions mixing what we fancy and his experience and knowledge..
Now on the Dishoom diner I was rather disappointed!
The food was all right but not impressive at all, to my taste
the decoration etc. was pretty nice and I appreciated that. but what's even more important is food, and I believe it was not great and it was overpriced and expensive...
Not to mention the super packed aspect to the experience, which is sort of OK when it's a very nice place, you think it's worth the hassle; but this added on the disappointment since I would't get / couldn't justify this for the food I had at all!",-1
5,"I think that this is one of the very best Indian places around town and I shall grant it with my first Yelp review. The place has never disappointed me in terms of food and quality of service. The dishes are not so big in size of portion but the value is definitely high. You pay for a well-designed space with some random decorations scattered around. They are not exactly compatible but the composition do make the restaurant look interesting and comfortable.
I can make a personal recommendation on the bacon rolls. The pork belly is smooth and glistering and cooked so well that it literally melts in my mouth. However, with the pork belly being on the heavy side, the dish is just the right size so I won't get too full. That leaves a wiggle room for dessert and another chance to leaf through the menu. There's this one particular dessert that can make you shiver from the goodness - the Pineapple and Black Pepper crumble. It does sound weird but one should try it before judging it.
Staff are always buzzing around and will come up always at the right time when you're ready to order up.",1
5,"My friends and I were visiting here and we heard that we must try Indian! We found this place on yelp and have to agree with the raving reviews! Between the three of us we ate way too much but couldn't stop! 
We ordered
Okra
Dishoom chicken tikka
Grilled masala prawns
House black daal
Chicken berry Britannia
Chicken ruby
Garlic naan
Guju chocolate mouse
Cinnamon ice cream
Memsahibs mess
My favorite was the house black daal which was cooked over a day! So much flavor and so good. Okra fries are a must as well as the chicken berry Britannia.  The grilled masala prawns were good as well the chicken ruby. Let's just be honest. It was all good. As for dessert, I wasn't a fan of the memsahibs mess, but the cinnamon ice cream was pretty good. 
This is definitely a place I would return to. I would also recommend making a reservation well ahead as we were lucky to get in.",1
4,"The queues are out of the door, all the time, every day! There's a good reason for that. This place serves up a mean dish of British-Indian cuisine. I've taken friends from all over the world to the different Dishooms and it has never disappointed. We even showed up at 10 to 11pm and they were more than happy to get us seated and serve us, on top of letting us stay well into the hour! A tad pricey for Indian cuisine in London - but you get what you pay for. A must visit!",1
4,"Although you can make a reservation online, you still must queue.  That's fine it's worth it.
The fact people queue up for an Indian restaurant in London should tell you something:  it's good.  I've eaten here several times and it never disappoints.
On this last trip we had a party of six that included 4 adults, 1 child and a newborn in a stroller.  We were seated downstairs which would have been an issue had there not been a 'lift'.  
After a brief wait in the bar we were seated at a perfect table which accommodated our stroller and our party.  
We had veggies samosas, calamari, lamb sheekh kabobs, Bombay toast, and then for dinner prawns, biryani and chicken tikka.
Also a couple of Bombay Chilli Martinis -
Quite good.
Highly recommended.",1
4,"For fast Indian food street concept that's the ideal place 
Love their beryani and Dal 
Keema with bun and bhel are amazing",1
5,"I was visiting London on a business trip and got to try this fabulous place on my first night in the city. Joining my co-workers and a late night food run and walked to Dishoom from our hotel which wasn't too far. Walking up to the restaurant, we were apprehensive since it was full to the brim and the waitress told us it would be a 45 minute wait. To our surprise, we only waited 15 minutes. As soon as I walked in, my senses were awaken by the spice that penetrated the air and made me more hungry than i thought i was. 
We ordered a bunch of small plates to share and Indian beer to drink and refresh our pallets. Needless to say, i had no idea what the dishes were called but i can't imagine there being a bad one on the dish. Even with a wait, it his worth every second. Next time i'm in the city i will most definitely make a stop at Dishoom.",1
5,Beautiful food! Had to wait a while to get seated but the cocktails were delicious and the plates were so fun to share and try once we sat down. Not even as expensive as we thought it would be! We left very full of high quality food and for reasonable price. The lighting and music is fantastic. Buy their compilation soundtrack - they sell it on the menu!,1
5,"If there a perfect Indian meal to be had in London this might be it. If you can stomach the 40 minute outside wait followed by another 20 minutes inside then you're ready to find out. Right from the start when they serve complimentary chai and sherry to those waiting in line, all the way through the snacks and cocktails in the waiting bar downstairs Dishoom does its best to minimize the one negative thing it has going for it which is it's insane and totally warranted popularity (you may have to flag the waitress down in the bar though, if there's one obvious thing to improve its that they should hire a second waitress, I could see quite a few people frustratedly trying to get her attention even tho she was working her butt off, there were just too many people down there).  The fried squid was far more delicious and had a spicy depth that belied the  calamari-like appearance. The ruby chicken is a little standard but very good version of chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan sopped up the spicy hot juices bringing just a glimmer of sweat to my brow. The black daal was maybe a tad dryer than I would have liked but again full of deep flavours. The paneer tikka was amongst the best I've ever had, made better by a topical spice that gave the cheese a nice saltiness. The veg up sell was totally boring however but not enough to lose a star. The highlight was the lamb chops which compared to another famous Indian lamp chop from Tayyabs comes out the winner. Finally the plain kulfi pop dessert was an amazing light and fragrant way to end the meal along with another cup of their amazing chai (which unlike many is actually really spicy)
Well worth the hype!",1
5,"Amazing!  Great service and food allergy friendly options (they had a special dairy free menu for my friend). Best indian food in London.  They don't take reservations after 6 so I would suggest taking the last reservation (5:45) to avoid the long lines later in the evening. 
The Chicken ruby was unreal.",1
1,"Came here with a party of 4 just a few minutes past 10pm on a Thursday night. My family came from California and wanted to try Dishoom the entire trip. We were turned away at the door for it being ""too late"" despite the restaurant being open until 11pm. We could have even ordered take out but the door man told us to go eat somewhere else. There were 2 couples in line in front of us, it's not like we brought an army of people to feed. We went to Punjab down the street and they were very accommodating.",-1
4,"I have walked past Dishoom on various occasions and was happy to have a good reason to enter as part of last night's Qype Review Crawl. The downstairs area reminded me of a German beer cellar and will come into its own in winter, I am sure (a bit dark for my liking when outdoors is treated to a rare ray of sunshine).
Dishoom is the perfect place for a quick bite to eat and perfectly located for pre-theatre dinner, etc. We were all quite intrigued by the breakfast menu which starts at 8am  excellent idea!
I am a big fan of tapas-style menus as I can never make up my mind and love the idea of tasting many different flavours. The portions are quite generous and the hardest decision will be when to stop ordering. We were lucky to be introduced to the head chef and learnt a bit more about the menu which is a collection of favourite dishes from different regions in India  apparently there is no other place where you'd find a similar variety.
We sampled a Bombay take on Pimms  a particular hit with fans of ginger beer!",1
5,"Loved this restaurant! Came in around midday on a Friday with a friend, fearing we'd hit the midday lunch rush, but luckily for us the place was practically empty, and we were seated right away!
Apart from that, the locale is lovely, and when presented with the menu, both of us had the hardest time choosing what we would be eating as there were so many dishes that looked equally (read: very) appealing (always a good sign)! In the end, we settled on their house black daal and the paneer roll, both of which were delicious! Had we had more time on our hands, I would have loved to try some of their desserts - the group seated next to us tried them, and they all looked very good (not to mention how good their cocktails looked- also absolutely must try them next time!). 
Given the number of Indian restaurants in London, and the admittedly varying quality of said restaurants, finding a centrally-located, well-priced, and excellent Indian like Dishoom is something of a miracle! I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",1
4,"Expect long hour waits during dinner time (pretty much every day of the week). But once you're past the lines, the fun begins. We had the Black Daal, Chicken Tikka, Masala Prawns, and Chicken Ruby. Highly highly recommend the Chicken Ruby - it was so good. 
Classy decor and ambience with attentive service. Very good experience overall. Will be back (with a reservation)!",1
1,"Markedly unprofessional behaviour by front of house staff on a Tuesday afternoon. Rude, dismissive, and unwilling to answer simple questions regarding wait times and availability. I will not be returning.",-1
5,"I had some friends from out of town visiting me so of course wanted to take them to the BEST Indian in London. Alas, of course, reservations were filled up a week ahead of time, so we decided to endure the queuing b/c it's worth it. And is it worth it. Just come with the right mindset. We went on a Saturday night around 7pm and ended up waiting 2 hours (knowingly). But they make the waiting experience as best as possible: offer chai tea and sherry samples outside, there are heat lamps to keep you warm, and once you're inside, you're sent to the bar to continue the wait but with drinks and nibbles in hand. If you're coming with good company, you don't really notice the wait. Once seated at our table, we had excellent service and of course, don't have to reiterate, the food is to die for. We were literally silent for about 10 minutes while everyone scarfed their food down. My mom always says that the chef's best compliment is silence. ;) Have been told this place is great for breakfast, so will have to do that sometime soon!",1
4,"YUM. Definitely not cheap Indian food but reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. The small plates (or tapas style) are fantastic and easy to share. Food came quickly, though service was a bit slow, and the restaurant is super packed (people kept bumping into my chair). Came here around 6:30pm on a Wed night. 
Calamari - Very tasty but small portions. The seasoning was fantastic.
Chicken Berry Biryani - Oooo that spice! Amazing biryani though nothing special when compared to other biryani's i've had. Pretty spicy, be warned. 
Mango and Paneer salad - The dressing was great. Very refreshing and worth getting tp balance out the heavier dishes. 
Daal - DELICIOUS. Can you taste the butter? Mmmm. I couldn't stop picking at this even when I was way past stuffed.
Naan - Standard
The waiters will try to push food on to you. We were prepared to order three things and the waiters kept telling us it was not enough. Um. Trust me. We had so much food left over, we felt guilty... and we were stuffed to the point of being uncomfortable. Start out with three dishes (maybe 2 mains and a starter for two) and build on that if you want. 
All the above, plus a mango lassi (Seems thinner and more watered down than most places. Not sure if I like that.) and chai (fantastic chai! though they only give you a tiny tiny cup... not a fan), was 20 quid per person. 
Again, not crazy expensive, but not cheap for Indian food either.",1
5,"This place is awesome; I went last night with two friends and we had a great time. The chargrilled prawns, the ruby chicken, the broken potatoes and the  black daal were stand - out for me. They also provided me with a version of their menu that had all the gluten-free options highlighted, which was much appreciated. 
The staff made some great recommendations as to what we should order, and the restaurant itself is really nice. It's a little annoying that they don't take table bookings after 6pm, but hey, they know what they're doing.",1
4,"Really  great Indian food here. I used live in Bradford in Yorkshire a place with a lot of wonderful Indian restaurants. I have to say this place is amazing , not only for its authentic indian dishes and atmosphere, but also for its innovation fusion dishes, really delicious, inspiring.",1
3,"I think this place is a little over-hyped.  I can't really fault the food - but it's not incredible, it's just a well honed menu that's cooked well...but it isn't ground breaking or any different to any other Indian restaurant around London really. I think it's mainly because this is a well decorated chain, that's the appeal.   We've had a few instances here where they haven't been able to adjust the menu even a little to suit our vegetarian friends - which is a shame as it wasn't difficult, then they kicked up a fuss about us, made us feel as though we were really demanding too much - so that's why I'm not giving it four stars.",-1
4,"Delicious, the restaurant was packed though, and the seating tight. The staff was exceptionally pleasant and the prices were on the expensive side of reasonable. I am very happy with my dining experience at Dishoom and would happily return.",1
4,"I'm definitely a fan of this haute Indian cuisine spot! The have the yummiest lassis, which you can opt to add a bit of vodka or whiskey to if desired. On a nice day, expect a line outside; as I approached Dishoom, I thought there was a day party going on - there were a bunch of fashionable Londoners on their phones waiting on line. Don't fret, it moves pretty quick.",1
4,"Wow! What a great restaurant. I've eaten here twice now - a few months apart - and really like it. Standouts for me were the black dal, biryani and paneer curry. However having tried much of the menu as well now, there is nothing I would not eat here. Lamb dishes, snacks, and even cheese toast have all been good.
Overall great service- but the optional service fees annoy me still. Something I'll never get used to in London.",1
5,Love this but so does everyone else. Can't get in when you want to and can't book which is a pain. Great food and concept though.,1
5,"Best meal I had in London. Great service, great indian food, wonderful drinks. It is large so it wasn't a crazy wait.",1
5,This place had to be the best Indian food I've ever had. I had not been to India before so we are discussing Indian food in London. I still had a wonderful time and really enjoyed the food. We got there around 5 and only had to wait about 15 minutes even though they said more than 35 minutes. The mixed drinks are delicious and the naan is to die for. We tried all three choices. Sooooo good. This is a MUST go!!,1
5,"I've done it - completed the Dishoom triumvirate. 
This one is probably the most popular branch of the most popular old-Bombay-style restaurant in London. Right on Upper St Martin's next to Jamie's Italian, there's no hiding from the crowds and that keeps the line outside for weekend brunch consistently long. For us (four people), the wait was about 25 minutes. We were given a buzzer and invited to wait downstairs for a table, though other parties were made to wait outside - not sure why the separation. 
There is a whole science to the service at Dishoom, designed so the customers never go ANYWHERE unescorted. We were radioed into the restaurant by two hostesses, and then had to check in with the indoor hostess, who directed us downstairs to someone else who showed us where to wait. A fifth staffer brought us to our table, and finally we met the sixth and final staffer, our server. Service is always friendly and they certainly had one of the lowest staff-to-guests ratios I've seen of late. There are tons of staffers buzzing to and fro, one guy in the kitchen who just slaps out chapatis onto the stone oven, and one extremely tall dude whose job seemed to be walking around being extremely tall and good-looking. The only complaint was that we had to prompt for refills on our ""bottomless"" Chai - servers twice took away our empty glasses without offering refills. At Dishoom Shoreditch they always offer refills, so it sucks to have to be aggressive about the ""bottomless"" part here.
Anyway, the food - as everyone and their mother have written - is stellar. Enhanced by a charming atmosphere with hanging lights, wooden tables and a general buzz in the air, this is a great place for a weekend catch-up brunch. The naan rolls were generously sized and freshly prepared, while the kerjiwal is greasy, cheesy, spiced, runny-yolk goodness. I liked how the toast didn't get soggy in the time it took to eat the dish. Be prepared for a bit of chaos, but it all goes down easy with the great food, warm service and fun dining room.",1
5,"Dishoom was our ""big dinner out"" place when I studied abroad in London, and I still fantasize about their black daal, which is the best I've ever had--and I've been to India! Their chicken tikka is tender and juicy, and the roomali roti (literally ""handkerchief bread"" for its thinness) is awesome for mopping up their curries. It's also a good place to get food that's more representative of Maharashtrian/Gujarati-style Indian cuisine, which is sorely lacking stateside. My dining companion, on one occasion, found the pau bhaji to be sort of overcooked, but I enjoyed it. We need more West Indian restaurants in the US!
They don't take dinner reservations (something that seems to be common amongst trendier restaurants in London--I guess to up the hype?) so it can be a wait, but they have a nice bar downstairs and they seat really quickly. I also like the 1960s Bombay kitsch of the decorations--plus they serve Limca in the bottle! What else could you ask for?",1
4,"Although a bit too polished for my taste, Dishoom's take on Indian dishes and its vibrant atmosphere make it worth a visit. Get their brunch omelette!",1
5,"Dishoom is fantastic. The menu makes my mouth water, and I always end up with too much food. They have one of the few paneers I really enjoy, and an eclectic, eccentric, delicious menu. Everything tastes fresh and zesty, and all the waiters are well-versed in their ingredients. They have a gluten-free menu and plenty of vegetarian options, although next time I go I'll take some more meaty friends and get the haleem, which always looks so good.
Even if there's a wait, it's well worth it; I've been here pre-theatre and it's always worthwhile. Very trendy decor and hip waitstaff.",1
5,Amazing food.  I went back to London recently for vacation and was so jet-lagged I actually made it for breakfast!  The Bombay Omelette or the Akuri are seriously to do by...,1
4,"I'm not a fan of Indian food but a tour guide led us here and I don't regret following her!
I ordered the Chicken Berry Biryani for £7.90. It was so delicious! 
The rice was not weighed down by sauces or fillings but rather, it was light and fluffy, mixed with the perfect amount of spices. It was on the spicy side but not flaming hot. Chicken was juicy and the right quantity. I do wish, however, that there were real berries in the dish; the ""berry"" was just cranberries/craisins. Still, the sweetness of the cranberries balanced the spicyness of the chicken and rice. 
My friends also ordered the Biryani and Dhaba Chicken Curry (£7.50) with naans (£1.70-1.90 each). 
I don't like the traditional yellow, coconuty-tasting, Indian curries but the Dhaba Chicken was a pleasant red curry and was not heavy at all! I wish it came with naan or rice already; instead, the meal kind of forces you to pay to have it on the side. 
Attentive service (compulsory tip) and classy place with downstairs seating for more formal gatherings or bigger groups. 
Definitely trendy and classy restaurant to bring coworkers, clients or friends visiting from out-of-town (:",1
5,"This is by no means an exaggeration when I say that my meal at Dishoom was hands down one of the best dining experiences of my life. Started out with an hour and a half queue in the cold, which could easy have ruined an evening out. However the wait flew by thanks to the rounds of free warm tea and chocolate-bourbon chai. The hostesses were friendly and accommodating and before we knew it we were waiting inside at the bar. The cocktails are great. I had the Bombay Bellini, consisting of raspberries, lychees, rose & prosecco. Seriously delicious. Like if I had one wish it would be for one of those to appear magically in my hand whenever I was hot and looking to cool down, or just at all times. When we were seated the waitress walked us through the menu. The food is tapas style, several small plats ranging from £2-£8. My boyfriend and I split veggie samosas, paneer tikka (jesus christ that paneer), a lamb rice dish, garlic naan and this fantastic black daal. Everything was incredible, the best Indian food of my life. I was floored by how flavorful (and cheap!) everything was. There was plenty of food for the two of us and our bill rounded up to a lovely £56,81.
So yeah the food is to die for and the cocktails are delicious, but what really put my visit to Dishoom over the top was the service. Every single staff member was so genuine and friendly, with out being over the top. Attentive and warm, with plenty of helpful information regarding the menu items. When I mentioned to the manager how impressed I was she bought us a round of drinks! Like what?? What is this magical place of delicious affordable wonderment?
It's Dishoom. That's what it is. 5/5 all the way.",1
3,"I came here for dinner after spending a somewhat rainy day seeing the sights in Westminster and spending a little time avoiding said rain at the National Gallery. Living right next to the neighborhood for curry in NYC (dubbed 'Curry Hill' as a result), I wanted to check out how curry in the UK would compare. Getting a seat was easy enough, but unless it was a bad day, do not sit downstairs unless absolutely forced to. There's no natural lighting (which is depressing at 6 PM), but whatever was going on in the bathroom was infecting the aroma of the entire room. I don't like dining in places that smell like dank urine. After struggling to breathe for a few minutes, my girlfriend and I were able to get a seat upstairs. Much better, but a mark off for having a bar downstairs that smells worst than most dives.
The food itself was alright, although I wasn't blown away, particularly at London prices. The lamb kebob was very flavorful, but the portions were a bit small (a recurrent theme with the dishes here). The dhaba chicken curry was good as well - the curry sauce was definitely more tomato-based (or vegetable-based) than the curries I'm used to, but it didn't leave much variety for the palette.
Service was pretty standard for Britain, so all in all, it was an experience that came in a bit under expectations. Even with ordering an appetizer (I forget right off which one we ordered), the bill came out to 40 pounds - which is pretty damn expensive given the rather small amount of food we ordered. Considering I can score top-notch curry + rice for under $20 in the U.S., I'd give the upper hand to the neighborhood shops that are right across the block.",-1
5,"I've been to India, and know clearly the difference between Indian food, as made over here, and over there. I can clearly say that Dishoom is the best indian I've tasted in the UK, hands down. Really, clear, crisp flavours, and some delicious combinations (plus being just down the road from my office) mean this is a place I'll be coming back to again and again.",1
4,"The wait can be long (although it's usually faster than they tell you) but it's delicious! Great ambiance and drinks as well. The brunch at Dishoom is divine: eggs, naan and sausage. Need I say more?",1
5,"Been here several times now for breakfast and I have yet to have a bad experience here. All food items have been great. Service is quite nice. It's just been really great.
Drink:
House Chai - this has been one of the best chai I've had in a while. No need to explain, you should just get this.
Fresh Mint Tea - comes in a pot and has mint notes that seem to satisfy you immediately as you take deep breathes through the nose. Good subtle flavors for your morning wake me up.
Food:
Bombay Omelette - Pretty straight forward dish, omelette with a hint of spice together with onion and tomatoes. The side of vine tomatoes that are grilled are a very nice add when having the omelette and bread together. 
Fresh Fruit and Yoghurt - This is a surprisingly good dish. Simply put together with yoghurt and various fruits like raspberries, blueberries, strawberries and honeydew. The vanilla beans are visible on the yoghurt and add the great vanilla flavor along with the tart and sweet fruits.
Bacon Naan Roll - ummmmm bacon... can't go wrong. That chili tomato jam with cream cheese is a nice combination. It's pretty sweet, but goes well with the salty, savory bacon wrapped up in the naan bread.
Would love to come here for their dinner service, but so far has not gone wrong during breakfast.",1
5,"Yum Yum YUM! I ordered the grilled paneer with bell peppers, garlic naan, and mango lassi. Everything was perfect. A little more expensive than my typical travel budget, but honestly so worth it. Great Indian food can be quite hard to find in the US, so I was really impressed with Dishoom.",1
4,"Great cocktails and food! A friend queued on my behalf so when I got there I got to slip right in, which probably helped my general experience here. Not sure I would bother queuing myself...",1
5,"This is probably one of the best restaurants in the world.  Period.
Ambience: Clean, quirky, always vibrant and friendly.
Ingredients: Excellent.  I want to buy groceries where they buy them.
Flavors: Subtle and amazing.  My bouche is amused every single time.  And even with the main courses that I eat regularly, every time, the flavors are phenomenal.
My favorites: nearly everything on the menu.
Now if only the lines outside were shorter!",1
5,"Normally I am very skeptical of hip Indian restaurant. I eyed calamari on the menu, and automatically wondered what in god's name has globalization done to us. What self-respecting Indian restaurant serves Mediterranean/Italian fare? Man was I wrong. Hip or not, dishoom has amazing Indian food. Don't believe me? Eye up the clientele. The best way to figure out whether an Indian place is legit is to find older Indian patrons. If they are satisfied, then you sure as hell don't have any excuse not to be. Dishoom was bursting with Indians, and large portion of them were older :)
For our food we ordered the Ruby Chicken, Kacchi Lamb Biryani with a side of Raita, and Roomali Roti. The Ruby Chicken was amazing. Perfectly complex, seasoned, and spicy. The biryani had prize pieces of Lamb. I am so used to getting sub par meat in Biryani, but the meat here was excellent. The raita was hands down the best I have ever had...creamy, thick, and cool. I only ordered one Roomli roti, but I honestly wish my own family could make roti as good as this one. All in all a wonderful meal and I can not wait to head back.",1
4,"I prefer the Shoreditch location as the atmosphere there is better, but the food is always delicious.  A nice alternative breakfast as the bacon naan roll and coffee are very good.",1
4,"Nice place for a quick breakfast. I want for one of their famous naan rolls. They say the naan is cooked to order but mine wasn't at all warm compared what you would expect if it was fresh out of the oven. However, saying that it still tasted amazing. The sauces are the stars and really bring it all together. Eggs perfectly cooked with the yolk still runny. The sausage however is just one small chipolata which is a bit of a downer but anything larger probably wouldn't work. Prices are reasonable for what you get. (Visit - 26/02/2015 Breakfast)",1
5,"This was our first dinner in London on our honeymoon and are we glad we went! Everything we had was absolutely delicious. The standouts were the black daal, chicken thighs, slaw, and of course the  pistachio kulfi (get one per person, amazeballs!). This restaurant reminded me why people adore indian food. I so wish that we were able to enjoy Indian food such as this in the states.",1
4,"Dishoom is a great place to enjoy a night.  Now we did have to wait an hour until we were seated for dinner, but we did have chai tea to warm us up while waiting outside.  Get here early, or your wait will be longer.
This is not a fancy place, but the food is great.  Gunpowder potatoes, with black daal.  Ruby chicken, spicy lamb, fresh flat bread.  Spicy shrimp was great.
The food was better than Quilon, which has a Michelin star for fancy food.",1
5,"Holy cow! Everything was amazing, delicious and bursting with flavor. The lamb samosas were tasty, the calamari got better with each bite, the garlic naan was delicious and the  chicken ruby was succulent and to die for. Our waitress, Maisse? Was so friendly, attentive and spot on with her suggestions.  I will be recommending this place to everybody I know.",1
5,"OMG, I still dream of their food at nights..
Spicy, tasty, and surprising.
We also had a cocktail before we were seated, very unique, lovely.
Although the restaurant was full the service was very good and efficient.
The place is a bit loud but that did not preventus from having a great late lunch.",1
5,"Ah,  Dishoom. How I have been waiting to eat your delectable creations. Finally, I had my chance.
Upon walking up to Dishoom, my husband and I noticed a ridiculously long line. Unfortunately for groups less than six people, reservations are not possible - get here early and prepare to wait in line (a long time if you're unfortunate) to get inside. Those wishing the battle the wait can either go downstairs to the tiny bar and enjoy refreshments or be served complimentary goodies (like masala chai) while waiting in line outside for which I applaud them. Very good manners, Dishoom. Well played.
Our line was supposed to be an hour long but as luck would have it, we waited less than 20 some minutes and were escorted inside to our table. 
The inside of Dishoom looks like what tea houses and cafes looked like in Bombay before they all started to disappear. Having gone to India in February, I was feeling nostalgic looking at all of the old Hindi film posters and black and white photographs. We were greeted immediately by our sever who asked us if we had ever eaten at Dishoom before. She guided us through the menu and suggested how we order - Dishoom is a small plates type of restaurant. It's best to order several items per person and share them. Dishes come out as soon as they're ready, so be prepared to receive items piping hot and in a random order. 
The cocktail list was interesting. Instead of ordering wine, we started with a Jack Daniels and Coke (for the husband) and a Bollybellini (for me). Opting to avoid our usual extravaganza of paneer dishes while eating out at an Indian restaurant, we ordered the pau bhaji, the house black daal, bowl of greens, rice, rajma frankie and gunowder potatoes. Everything was excellent - I don't need to go into the particularities of each dish. All I'll say is next time, I'll order a paneer dish, skip the greens and daal (although it's famous, I've had better. The pau bhaji was absolutely excellent (you can taste the butter) but more bread should be served with such a big portion. We each also sampled more cocktails - Edwina's Affair (or Edwina's something) and the Bombay Pimms and skipped dessert - we were far too stuffed to order more food, although we considered it more than once.
Dinner was pricey but worth it. Service was friendly and attentive. Everything was sparkling clean and the restaurant itself appears to run like a well-oiled machine. Downstairs in the bathroom, behind glass cases are very vintage looking Indian medicines to cure all sorts of remedies - a very interesting and thought-provoking display for those who have visited India. 
We will most definitely be back!",1
5,"My husband and I aren't big fans of Indian but decided we had to go to at least one Indian restaurant while in London and Dishroom did not disappoint! We ordered the Chicken Ruby, lamb rice pilaf (can't remember the proper name), garlic naan, Black Daal, & raita all of which were fabulous! There will wait if you go during normal dinner hours but ours wasn't nearly as long as they told us it would be and we got complimentary mint and chai tea.",1
4,"Really nice food, lovely decor, we enjoyed the colonial design. Good service. Thank you.",1
4,"After reading all of the stellar reviews from various published reviews, newspapers, magazines, etc, I was really expecting a super wow experience. The staff is great and the service was very good. Be prepared to wait if you don't get in before 6 or don't have a rez. The que can move pretty quickly, but be prepared to wait. The food was tasty and the vibe is fun. I've eaten at the one in Shoreditch and Covent Garden and they are consistent. I just wouldn't say this is the best Indian food I've ever had.",1
4,"This is a great place if you're looking for an authentic taste. I was shocked to see the line of people waiting to eat there but after my meal, I would wait also. It's worth it. Service is great and fast!
Recommendations: 
garlic naan
chicken ruby 
mattar paneer",1
2,"Overrated, overpriced. The food is good, the atmosphere is ok (when not overcrowded), this poor chain of restaurants is a victim of its own success - not for people who actually want to enjoy their food AND their conversation. On the plus side, definitely worth a try, the food is quite nice. Just not living up to the hype it has.",-1
4,great food with satisfying services!,1
5,Great food and ambiance.  The place is packed - busy and yummy.  You should share dishes. I didn't mind waiting 30 minutes outside in the cold -  I'll be back!,1
4,"I tried the keema pau, pav bhaji and dishoom chicken tikka role. Pav bhaji was excellent.. A liitle less oil and the keema pau would make it to the 5 star list... The chicken tikka tole was also good and had a flavor resembling thai peanut sauce... The staff is always smiling and the service is fast and excellent.",1
3,"This was my second time eating at Dishoom, and I must say I was not as impressed as I was the first time. Their signature chicken curry dish is absolutely amazing, I have go give them that, but I found their other dishes subpar. My boyfriend ordered a paneer curry dish that lacked in flavor and spice, was not even comparable to the taste of the chicken curry that I ordered.
Wait is often incredibly long, and it is crowded and loud in the restaurant. Maybe I just went on an off day this time, but I was not as impressed with it and believe that there are other more authentic indian restaurants with less wait and hype in the area.",-1
5,"This was probably my favorite meal during my recent trip to London. I had been wanting to check it out since my last business trip when two separate co-workers had tried it and came back with positive reviews. Our party of four had to wait a little over an hour to get in, but the time went by quickly. The hostesses that managed the line were very friendly, and I loved the chai and mint tea they brought out to the line to keep us warm.
My favorites of the night were the fried skate cheeks and okra from the appetizer/small plates menu as well as the lamb biryani and chicken ruby (curry) from the main entrees menu. Heck, everything was delicious though; I really doubt that you can go wrong with your ordering here.
We rounded out the evening with sulfis all around for dessert. The pistachio sulfi was absolutely marvelous; you've got to try it!
Anyway, I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in London. So, so good!",1
5,this is my second experience at Dishoom and I am still in love. This is my first time at the central london locations as last time I went to the east london Dishoom. The food and service is great. I went at lunch time/ mid week so I didn't have to stand in line. I think when you stand in line for food you are often let down as you expect so much from standing in line. People who have had to stand in line to eat here may give this place less points. I do love this place and can't wait to try again. ps their house made kulfi is amazing! Cheese naan so tasty and very cheesy in a good way! yay for Dishoom! my favorite indian in London! although it is not traditional indian food it is one special place.,1
5,"My tummy still smiles when I think about the meal I had here, and my eyes cry, because it's located over 3,000 miles away now.  While visiting London, my husband and I put Indian Food high on the culinary priority list, and my fellow yelpers did not steer me wrong.  We enjoyed calamari, lamb samosas, naan and a chicken curry dish that I wish I could remember the name of.  Every bite was better than the last, and our server was friendly, attentive, efficient and ready with a recommendation or two!
Do make reservations, even on a week night.  We were there on a Tuesday night with a reservation, and were seated immediately, whereas the wait was already a half an hour otherwise.  By the time we finished dinner, there was a line down the block.",1
5,"Love this place! Everything we ordered was amazing! If you plan to come here def order the mattar paneer and chicken curry, hands down you will die and go to heaven! I really enjoyed the open kitchen concept, dim lighting, and restaurant atmosphere was fun and loud! Totally worth the 1 hr wait in the cold! You gotta try it!",1
3,"OK Indian in Covent Garden.  I expected a lot more spice here.  The food was tasty but had no kick.  What!  I want spice and there was little.  Service good and I really enjoyed their own IPA though.  In sum, I'll try another Indian restaurant the next time I'm in London.",-1
5,"Amazing experience!  Arrived early on a Sunday evening (5:45p) and waited outside in the chilly November weather for 25 minutes before getting the all-clear to wait in the bar downstairs (for another 20 minutes). 
Super cool place with great service. Our friendly hostess outside kept us informed and entertained. Lovely chai drinks kept us toasty while we waited. The bar wait was pleasant as well.
When we got to our table out waiter was amazing with perfect recommendations. Top 5 dinners my husband and I have had - including Sydney, Nice, San Francisco and Buenos Aires.
We will return to enjoy the ruby chicken, fried okra, maslasa prawn, and the black bean dall (the bomb!). 
Don't miss it!  Worth the wait!",1
5,"So this is the spot we picked for our one dinner in London, and it did not disappoint. We came after watching the Lion King, and arrived around 10:30pm. No wait and was seated right away.
Food - Veggie Samosas, Chiken Tikka, Black Daal, Garlic Naan and my wife and I were in heaven! Everything was fantastic and very authentic. With one alcoholic drink, the meal was around $50, which I felt was very worth it. I also must mention that the food came out super quick.
Interior- so very nice and modern, while still keeping their heritage. The bathroom was even awesome.
I highly recommend this place! It's so nice to be able to use Yelp internationally and find places like this.",1
4,"Found this place using Yelp, and happy I did. There was a wait to get in, but it was not very long at almost 10pm and flying solo.
Staff were all very friendly and my waiter had a grasp on the menu and was able to answer questions I had. 
The food. I ordered chili bread(?) appetizer, ruby chicken, basmati rice, and garlic naan. My main, rice and naan actually came out before my starter, which was a little surprising, but worked out fine as I dipped the bread in the ruby sauce. Chili bread was tasty, but really nothing to get excited about. Rice was very good and cooked to perfection. Garlic naan was good, but a little thick around the edges. 
I like a little bit of heat with my Indian food (usually a vindaloo guy), but the waiter warned me that non of their dishes were overtly spicy hot.  The ruby chicken was supposed to be one of the spicer dishes available. It had great flavor and was very tender, but was missing the heat I really wanted. They did serve some little sauces which included a pepper one, that did help a bit. I have found in general the British are a little tame when it comes to adding heat, so I'm sure this is partially why there is nothing ""hot"" on the menu. 
Prices are a little much for the portion sizes. 
High quality food, lacking heat, but tasty.",1
5,"We ordered:
OKRA FRIES: This was a little too dry. My friend actually loved it bc of that. This was my least favorite
CHICKEN RUBY. OMG... this was so good. I could have licked the bowl clean
CHEESE NAAN: this was really good. ordered it for my daughter. reminded me of a quesadillas with green onions
ROMALI ROTI: this was good for soaking up all the sauces!
HOUSE BLACK DAAL: this was good. great with the BASMATI RICE.
MARSALA PRAWNS.. this was so good!
RAITA: this you need to have to eat with the rest of the dishes
I'm so sad I'm leaving London bc I will be craving Dishoom's Chicken Ruby!",1
4,Must order the Black Daal! It goes great as a side with any entree and is absolutely incredible. Attentive service and nice atmosphere. Outside seating is very nice as well. Food is superb!,1
4,"There are plenty of Indian restaurants in London and despite that this one usually has a queue out the door. That many people can't be wrong and in good groupthink fashion I went with the crowds and after my experience I was happy I did. 
The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Indian cuisine was unfamiliar to us so the server gave us a thorough rundown of the menu. In the end we left it up to our server and we were rewarded with a flurry of tastes and spices. Yes, this is bold and dangerous at an Indian restaurant. However, the food was colorful, flavorful, aromatic, and some dishes, not all, were spicy. The cheese naan can and should be dipped in just about any of the sauces accompanied by the food. 
Order a kingfisher beer which compliments the spicy food. 
Don't be afraid to use your hands! 
For dessert they offer these ice cream Popsicles in a variety of flavors. Do get one.",1
4,"Obviously more expensive than you'd find in Whitechapel or along Brick Lane but still totally good value for money! And wonderful if you don't want to smell like curry after your meal.
I once dined at Dishoom twice in a week, that's how good this Bombay-inspired eatery is. Situated in Covent Garden, it's super central and good for groups up to six but beyond that be prepared to split up.
Not to be missed: pau bhaji and the lamb biryani (make sure to pair with raita!)
I'm hoping someday soon to join the Bombay Breakfast Club (yup, Dishoom's open in the morning!) Bacon naan roll, anyone?",1
5,"Dishoom (Bombay Cafè, Covent Garden)
Dishoom Dishoom, does it ring a bell? Well it's all in the name, an Indian version of the sound Kapow!!! - That exaggerated noise when a fist connects with the flesh of a baddie in a Bollywood film.
Hmmmm, maybe I'm just a sucker for all things Bollywood, especially movies from the 1970's to 1995's, an era absolute epicenes and crazy dance moves. 
So when I was set on a mission to organize a much needed dinner date with my girlfriends, Dishoom was definitely a top choice with excellent reviews, not to mention its website which kind of got me captivated. So check it out guys here's the link:
dishoom.com
Having booked a table for 6:00pm, we were able to cut through the long queue and be seated promptly.

5,"My friends told me I couldn't leave London without trying some Indian food, so after looking up Indian restaurants on yelp I stumbled onto Dishoom. I came here for lunch and was really looking forward to trying some Indian curry. There is also a breakfast menu here that looked really good and one of my regrets was not being able to try that.
I came without a reservation on a Monday and there was a slight wait, but was able to get seated within 10 minutes. I ordered the Chicken Ruby with steamed Basmati rice. By far the best curry I have ever had and went well with the rice (I should have ordered naan too!). To my surprise, when I got my bill, I found out they had an event on Mondays where you roll a die and if you get a certain number, your meal is free! However, my luck wasn't great that day...whole meal came out to about £11. I would recommend this place to anyone exploring London and looking for good Indian food!",1
4,"The only bad thing I can say is the wait for a table.
Great customers service and food. The lamb samosa was
delicious but very small and pricey. Loved the black dalh and
ruby chicken.",1
5,"I absolutely loved this Indian restaurant. It was the only one I ate at on my GB trip (unfortunately), but I'm so glad it was this one because it was some of the most unique Indian flavors I've ever had. Everything we had was flavorful and delicious. The only dish that the group thought was meh was the spicy lamb chops. Decor here has a gastropub feel and I loved it. 
My favorite dishes: Chicken berry britannia and chole chawal",1
4,"After walking by a couple of nights in a row and seeing the line go down the block, decided to drop in early on a Friday evening and was lucky enough to snag a table just ahead of the dinner rush. 
My lamb biryani came straight out of the oven with the dough seal still on the lid and was delicious, along with the garlic naan.  Nice atmosphere and great food means I'll be back the next time I'm passing through.",1
5,"Splendid selection of Indian dishes. Some unusual, some simple, all amazingly tasty. 
Fast friendly service and great atmosphere and decor. 
Recommended.",1
4,I liked the service very much. Very good food if you like Indian flavored dishes. Long wait,1
4,"Yummy!
My impression of this place may be skewed since I was mad hungry. It was delicious nonetheless. Had the lamb biryani (yogurt that went with it was fresh and crisp), chicken ruby, and vegetable samosa - split with my friend. It was enough between the both of us. We also each ordered hard ciders, which were plenty for our tummies.
The place itself is HUGE! We ate outside but I went inside to use the bathroom. Very cute design inside.",1
5,"Only been once for after-work drinks... a yummy thumps up float followed by quite possibly the most amazing pistachio kulfi in the world... this is the kinda place that makes me miss London
Love the decor and vintage bollywood vibe ..so trendy & fitting for The Great Indian meal :)",1
5,Lovely Indian fusion kitchen. Love their chicken ruby and their murgh malai. And try the okra fries - they're fantastic. Sweet and helpful staff all the way round. Only been there at lunchtime and thus avoided the lineup outside. Will most definitely return when in London next time.,1
3,"We came here based on the Yelp reviews. Being a friday evening, there was a large crowd gathered outside which is always a good sign. We didn't have reservations and we were told the wait would be an hour. However, it ended up being far shorter (maybe 30 min?) and time passed by quickly as we made small talk with other customers. They serve complimentary drink samplers which are delicious while you wait for your table.
The place is extremely clean and the decor is modern eclectic, lighting is a bit too focused, like spotlights on you, rather than ambiance lighting. it gets pretty loud in the rooms but not annoyingly so. Service is very good though the busy night left the hosts a bit frantic. 
We started with the Far Far, a crispy appetizer with spicy sauces. Delicious and my favorite dish. A crispy treat with a nice spicy kick to it. Next came the Bada Pau, a potato mash on dinner bun, which I enjoyed as well though my wife didn't. The potato was well prepared though my wife felt that it wasn't nothing special. The Spicy Lamb Chops followed. This was the most disappointing dish for us both. The meat was overcooked which made it dry and a bit too fatty. I understand that the fat is likely left on to keep the meat moist but they still missed the mark on this one. The Black Daal, a lentil based dish, was my wife's favorite. She enjoyed the perfect creamy consistency and felt that it was seasoned perfectly. She felt that it was perfectly paired up with the Garlic Naan. On the other hand, I felt that it was lacking in flavor and was a bit too watery. The Roti was a bit too rubbery and lacking the toasted softness that is typical of a good roti. 
All in all, I was left disappointed while my wife was a bit less so but commented that she would return to explore the menu more.",-1
4,"Nice deco and excellent service good food   average price for 3 dishesa  GBP 39, nice area 3 min by walking from five guys ,",1
5,"This place makes me wish I lived in London. I came here for a solo Sunday lunch and left thoroughly stuffed and satisfied. The house black daal (£4.90) was soul-warming, thick and mildly spiced, the ultimate comfort food. It was perfect scooped up with chewy roomali roti (£1.90) and naan (£1.90), both freshly baked. I think the thicker naan held the daal better than the roti, though both were delicious. I couldn't stop eating it, even on a scorching hot day! The naan and roti were also great with the chutneys on the table. I'd accept the cold London winters if I could eat this every day. 
Dessert was just meh. If a dessert is more expensive than my entree, it better be amazing, and the pineapple & black pepper crumble (£5.20) wasn't. That's not to say it was awful -- it wasn't too sweet and I could taste the black pepper in the topping. It paired well with the cinnamon ice cream, but after a heavy meal, I would have preferred just the ice cream, or one of the kulfis.
The atmosphere was certainly unique. Loved the Bombay cafe decor. I never felt rushed, although I've heard the waits for dinner get quite long!",1
5,"Even with the long queue my wife and children (21 months and 9 yrs) thought it was worth the weight.  We loved the food, the service was quick, the cost was relatively decent.",1
5,"Love this restaurant.  A great place to go for a pre theatre dinner as service is very efficient. Food is excellent. Love the ruby chicken and the black daal. Excellent signature mocktails with watermelon.  Yes, you have to get there early; but it is worth the wait.",1
5,"Indian is by far my favourite food in the world and I have visited India several times so my standards are pretty high. In a town full of Indian restaurants I must say this place really delivers!
They serve modern versions of the Mumbai areas classic dishes. The portions aren't big as they are meant for sharing. 
It is usually really busy so you might have to wait for a table, especially if you are a group. Everytime we have visited they have told us that we have to wait 30-40 minutes for a table but this has never happened. We have usually ended up waiting for only ca. 20-30 minutes max! They have a bar downstairs where you can enjoy some extremely tasty Lassi's while waiting (with or without rum). While waiting I would highly recommend the ""chili & cheese on toast""!",1
3,"Lamb chops were overrated. The potatoes were really weak... the chicken curry is not bad but not amazing. The Dahl had a good taste but once again, not amazing. 
The only thing that I really enjoyed were the Lamb Samosas. I may be spoiled with the Indian food in San Francisco and Bay Area but this place just was not special to me.",-1
4,"When in London, one must always do Indian at least once. A sin if you don't. One of the things I look forward every time I'm here. My fiance and I were walking around and decide to pop in Dishoom. I'm usually skeptic of well manicure places as they usually atrac large numbers of tourists and eventually become tourist traps. But Dishoom was not the case. Nice decor, great service, even better food. One quick glance through the menu and this was the order.
 -Keema Pau
 -Murgh Malai
 -Dishoom Chicken Tikka
 -House Black Daal
 -Cheese Naan
 -Raita
 -Mango Fennel Lassi
 -Dishoom IPA
Where to start? The beer, Dishoom IPA, is a house recipe brewed by a local brewery. Not like any IPA I have had before. Crisp, refreshing with notes of spices, it went perfect with the meal. The mango fennel lassi was incredibly smooth and tasty. The food was incredible. All of it. 
The bad part, I don't have anything like this close to home.",1
5,"This place is awesome!  I went on a recent business trip to London and the waiter said they are planning to come to New York- I can't wait!  
The food was excellent, as was the service.  Highlights included the roti, house black daal and the mutter paneer. 
Looking forward to going back!",1
4,"A unique menu with loads of gluten free and dairy free options. Their calamari and cocktails are to die for (on which point, I am dreaming of them bringing back their Chowpatty Beach pop-up bar - those were some awesome frozen cocktails!!!!)",1
4,"Pretty awesome! Rating of some of the food we tried here : 
Black dal - 9/10
Matar Paneer - 5/10
Pav Bhaji - 8/10
Rajma Chawal - 8/10
Breakfast scrambled egg - 1/5 (really oily)",1
3,"I think I need to come here one more time to taste the food here properly, the restaurant always very busy, always a very long queue outside and they don't do advance booking.  I waited at least 25 mins in the queue before I get a table. We order two rice dishes, both are similar, the food isn't as heavy as the other India restaurant.",-1
4,"Great curry in an awesome setting. However, living in Tooting, I've been spoilt buy the best curry London has to offer already.",1
4,"The food was good, it wasn't amazing but it's definitely better than most indian restaurants. The true standout element for Dishoom is it's silver screen old bollywood ambience. Everything from the little mint tea and chai glasses served to the people waiting in line to get into the restaurant to the decor in the restrooms was perfectly coordinated for a fantastic, entertaining experience.",1
4,"Not quite the best Indian I've had --- but really, really good!   With two pretty ladies in tow, we settled here for lunch -- it was awesome!   I must say, that this place is very hit or miss, to get a table!   Always busy during peak times, so make reservations, or roll the dice like we did!   
The food is awesome -- the service, not as much!   Maybe they just get busy.   I was here a few times and the service wasn't all the great -- 5 tables occupied and 10 waiters standing around doing nothing.   Not even to refill a water glass.   Oh well.
The food saves it here -- its fresh and really awesome!   Not be missed:  the House Black Daal -- totally rocking.   The chicken was awesome as well, so get that.   Take some time looking over the menu -- its extensive -- but worth it -- everything we ordered was good.
If you've ever wanted to know what Bombay was like with the British influence, come here.   You'll get the idea quickly!",1
5,"Great Indian food with very (very) strong flavors.  We didn't risk trying the dishes labeled as spicy.  Our favorite items were the bhel to start and the black daal.  To drink, the nimbu pani -- a ""light lemondrink to quench the thirst"" -- was incredibly tangy and refreshing.  Unfortunately, our service was a bit spotty -- our server completely forgot to get us water or chutneys.  
There was a queue outside to be seated, complete with magic tricks and drinks.  We were brought down to the bar when space opened up and given a buzzer for when our table was ready, which ended up being sooner than they had told us.",1
5,"The hype is real! I ordered a lamb bun dish (forgot the name), and it was excellent.  But the main highlight (and most memorable) was the Chicken Tikka.  The chicken was juicy and moist, and the levels of flavor were so intense, I can't even describe them into words.  My mind was completely blown.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, so bonus points there too.",1
5,"Indian tapas has arrived, in it's true Mumbai form! I had heard of this place through the interwebs and started to follow them on Twitter. Any company that engages with their customers well and makes you feel like part of the family has two thumbs up from me! They're really friendly and always up for a tweet or two, and if you're lucky you might get an invite for some free chai!
The food was mouth-watering...in fact my mouth is watering right now as I think back to the Pau Bhaji and Chicken Tikka dishes - mmmmmm. Their naan's are made to perfection; soft with a slight crisp and no need to chew for 10 mins before you can move on to the next bite!
The Tipples (cocktails) are genius! I had a Bhang lassi and if you're of the Indian kind you'll just have had a Scooby ""huuuuh"" moment. It's lassi with a generous amount of Rum and garnished with mukwaas! Delish!
I cannot wait to their breakfast menu one of these days and i'll definitely be visiting again....this month in fact!",1
3,I don't get the raves.  Mediocre Indian food at best.  Pretentious and definitely not worth the wait in the evenings.,-1
5,"Fabulous food!  We tried several of the plates and all agreed that the dahl and tikka chicken were the best, as was everything else we tried. The kids thought it was near the top of the Indian places we've tried and we would agree. 
We were a bit daunted by the line running out the front door and down the block (especially with 2 hungry kids in tow) but we stuck it out--and we are really glad we did!
While waiting someone came and took our name and number of people, then someone else came and gave us free sample of their chai tea drink. A nice touch that made the wait easier to bear. 
After about 50 minutes we were seated. The whole process was very well organized and everyone was very friendly both during the wait and during dinner, often checking to see how we were doing. 
Highly recommend even if you have to wait.",1
4,Just the right choice of vegetarian dishes.,1
4,"We really enjoyed Dishoom. The service was very fast, maybe a bit too hurried, but since we were going to a show in the West End, we didn't mind.
Ordered the black Dahl, chicken tikka and butter naan and they were all excellent. I will warn the ""faint of spice"", the dishes are on the spicy side. Also ordered the Dishoom branded IPA and it was disappointing so don't go there.
Lost a point to my taste because of too much butter on the butter naan (I know... What did I expect???), lamb appetizer was undistinguished and the service just a bit too over attentive. That said, Go Go Go!",1
5,"Loved the atmosphere, our server, and especially the food!  Definitely try the House Black Daal and for dessert definitely the Kulfi.  We got the pistachio, but I'm sure any of those flavors would be good.  Those were the standouts, but everything was delish!",1
2,"All flash no flavour.
As other reviewers have mentioned, the way, even on a Thursday night, is about 45 minutes to an hour. While you are awaiting,  you can hang out at the bar downstairs where they have Indian inspired cocktails.
My friend ordered the Boybam Pina Colada which was okay. It just tasted heavily of coconut milk and some 'Indian' spices. That being said, the atmosphere was lovely, the decor is very classy and the lighting makes for a great vibe. 
We ordered the samosas to start which were £4.00 a portion. Not. Worth. It. They are the packaged kind that you can get at any Sainsbury's or Tescos so avoid them if you can. The papadoms are delicious as is the naan bread. The curry is mediocre. Nothing you can't / won't get at a local Indian delivery place. 
In summation, go for the vibe but not the flavour.",-1
4,"Fantastic food, but an inordinately long line. I deduct a star because even when you reach the front of the line, you still have further to wait in the bar (which isn't clear when you're queuing).",1
4,"One of the reasons I like traveling to London is the Indian food. Dishoom does not disappoint, their dishes are full of flavor and the lamb dish I had was surprisingly spicy, which I like. Save room for desert.",1
5,"Fantastic vegetarian food! My wife and I split the Pau Bahji, Paneer Tikka, House Black Daal, and Bowl of Greens, with the Roomali Roti and Steamed Basmati Rice--so, so amazing! The Chili Martini was also fantastic! This might be the best Indian food I've ever had.",1
3,"very good food but not better than the Indian food you get in Berlin. It's quite expensive for a supposedly high class Indian meal at a top location. at the end i felt like i paid way too much for a good indian meal i could also get else where. the cue can go from 30 min (when you're lucky) to 2 hours before you can get seated at a table. nice atmosphere and caring waitresses/waiters. I almost walked straight in and ignored the hostesses at the door as they were wearing jeans, chucks and leather jackets and looked like students at a part time job.",-1
5,"This is probably my favorite Indian restaurant that I have ever been to. The black daal, that is all I can say. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I love nearly everything that I have ordered here (Okra fries), but would not recommend their cocktails. One was actually really bad. Other than that, the service is friendly and you need a party of 6 or more to get a table. Really annoying considering the wait line takes an hour at least. If you can get in, I would highly recommend eating here. I was waiting for this meal for weeks when we finally got to London.",1
5,"Whenever I'm in London, I come to Dishoom every time with a friend. Next time, I'll go again with a friend. It's my go to place for breakfast.",1
5,Some of the best Indian food I've ever had. I always make time for dishoom on every trip to London.,1
5,"There was a large line outside, but it is totally worth it. We had a great server Adrienn and ordered Black Dahl, Chicken Tikka, Plain Naan, Matar Paneer, Cinnamon Ice Crean and Pistachio Kulfi. Definitely a meal that will not be forgotten.",1
5,"The Black Lental Dahl. Excellent! Everything else was yummy too. Biriyani, naan, sauté veggies. All great.",1
5,"Damn, wish we had an Indian restaurant like this in Los Angeles.
Our group ordered all the vegetarian items on the menu. We had to order more food after the first round, it was that good!
Check this place out, I've never been to an Indian restaurant like Dishoom. The atmosphere is great too!
Get the ""Thums Up"", an original Indian cola, to wash it all down. Yummmm. 
""Thums Up, Taste the Thunder""",1
4,"I visited Dishoom with my sisters. Try to make a reservation beforehand as this place is definitely popular. The decor makes you feel like you are in an early-1900's cafe in Bombay, so refreshing compared to other standard Indian restaurants.
We ordered a range of things to share. I am a big fan of okra fries, house black dhaal, grilled paneer, and the masala prawns. The garlic naan is also a must. I was surprised to see that they did not have peshwari naan. The only dish that I wasn't impressed with was the vegetarian briyani. It was mediocre and had nothing special.
The prices were extremely reasonable and my sisters and I agreed that this spot is really one of the best Indian spots we've been to in London.",1
4,"My friends and I had originally spotted Dishoom while staying at Shoreditch  but it had been a Friday night so the restaurant was crowded and we didn't feel like waiting; fortunately, on our trip to Covent Garden we passed by it and decided to venture in as the line was not long. We were impressed by the staff's efficiency in getting us seated and their communication with one another. The menu looked divine and I ordered the black daal and naan, while my friends ordered vegetable samosas, chicken ruby and a potato dish. The food arrived promptly and everything tasted absolutely fantastic. I've had daal in several places before but the daal at dishoom was some of the best I've ever had. We finished off the meal with mango kulfi, a rich, creamy mango Popsicle which was the perfect finale to a great meal. Prices are good for the quality of the food and the restaurant has a lovely ambience.",1
4,"Had dinner here last night and I fell in love with the curry, as well as the okra chips.  The staff was very nice and the food was great, though I've had better naan at other locations.  Then naan was good, though it was a tad too crispy for my own taste as I prefer it fluffier, but that's no deal breaker.  They also had Kingfisher beer, which is easily the best Indian beer around. The place is small and dark but has a nice atmosphere and if you have to wait to be seated, you'll get hooked up with spiked chai which definitely makes the wait a lot more pleasant.
I would certainly put Dishoom down on my list of places to check out if looking for Indian food while in London.",1
4,"I went to the Covent Garden restaurant downstairs was a little dark, but the menu had a good choice and the food was good",1
4,"My experience was very similar to that of the other reviewers. The food at Dishoom is great, but the servers are pushy and inattentive.",1
4,"Dishoom is best known for their Indian cuisine, but the star of the show for me was their Thums Up Flip.  The best description of this cocktail can be found directly on Dishoom's website:  
dishoom.com/2012/05/clas…
.
(Yes, I'm aware of the laziness inherent to my decision NOT to describe the cocktail)
As for the cuisine, this is a refreshing departure from curries loaded in oils and fat or rice dishes buried in a pile of butter.  Rather, you will find a celebration of grilled meats spiced to perfection, proper preparations of biryani loaded with flavor from spices and your accompanying meat of choice, and delightfully soft naan (the one area where I do enjoy a rather unhealthy coat of butter).  
Overall, I think Dishoom served some solid cuisine in a chic space and adds welcoming dashes of great service and splendid drinks.  I'd go back if I was in the area.",1
3,"This place was so popular that I wasn't able to get dinner here, so we came back the next morning for brunch. They don't have a dairy free friendly menu, even though they have a ""dairy allergy menu."" The allergy menu highlights what doesn't have milk (mostly drinks, they don't have milk substitutions) and what can be made without milk/butter (not many of the dishes, as all the bread contains milk.) Breakfast here was just ok, for some reason they were burning incense downstairs where we were seated. They did have what looked like a smoke detector inside but no fire sprinklers.",-1
5,"Excellent Indian food in a trendy Bollywood setting.  We walked in without a booking and were lucky to be seated right away.  The waiter had good explanations of the dishes, which came out incredibly fast.
It may not be the most authentic Indian food, but it was delicious and the environment was lively and fun.  Good place for families too.",1
5,"This was our last dinner in London and we definitely ended with a fantastic meal. After hearing that I MUST try the Indian food in London, I thought Dishoom would be my best bet. It totally was. There was a wait when we arrived around 8 pm but we were seated within 30 minutes or so. 
I wanna say the menu is set up kinda like a tapas style..which can make it expensive. We ordered a pitcher of Bombay Pimm's to start and it was delicious! We ordered some naan and veggie samosas for apps, definitely recommend both. I ordered the chicken tikka and devoured each bite, especially with that fabulous yogurt sauce. I wish it was in the states so I could enjoy it whenever I wanted!",1
5,"Outstanding food and service. And NOT too pricey. For three eaters, with drinks, our bill was £46. The wait was long as they don't accept reservations after 6pm for parties of less than six. We had about 25 mins of waiting outside, which wasn't too bad because of the friendly staff and people, and were served tea often. Then we had another 30 mins of waiting at their downstairs bar, before collecting our buzzer. The drinks and appetizers were excellent. Do NOT miss the Kolawadi Prawns - trust me, I know Indian food. They are spicy, but not crazily so. For the main course, we had the following all excellent, all 5-star dishes: the Ruby Chicken (not for those that love very spicy Indian food and like all their Indian meals to be mad spicy), the chicken biryani, rumali rotis, black daal, and a pistachio kulfi (on a thin, pointy stick, just like in India!) for dessert. OUTSTANDING!",1
5,"I loved it.
So my sister and I went for black dhal, soft shell crab, chicken tikka, salad and dessert.
Black dhal was just soooo amazing - it's a must if you're here - it's very slowly cooked (I think they say something about 24 hours...) Soft shell crab in a curry sauce was nice though a bit too salty - with some roti it went well. Chicken tikka was succulent, fresh and juicy - definitely worth a try. And dessert (chocolate mousse) was heavenly. Thing is - you mix it with the frozen yogurt yourself and a yogurt is so much healthier than heavy cream!
We left the place satisfied, but not disgustingly full when you down heaps of oily curries and thick naan - but more like 'happy inside' and feeling good about ourselves.
The atmosphere in this place is quite cool - sort of old school bollywood meets urban. It has dimmed light and nice music. Perfect!
The service was good and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely come back!",1
5,Everything about the place is great. There is a bar downstairs they allow you into before dinner to break up the wait. Then once your table is ready they have a very courteous wait staff. the food is great and my only tip would be to get the fried okra.,1
4,"I have always heard that the one cuisine that the UK has got on lock is Indian, and I was not disappointed.  I was meeting up with a fine Irishman that I know from NYC for dinner and he suggested we come here.  Points for him because everything was awesome - from the food down to the service.  We didn't make a reservation and it was quite crowded at 7pm so we sat down by the bar and had a drink while waiting for a table to open up.  The hostess told us it would be an hour wait, but ended up being about 20 minutes, really.
Food is served tapas style, but don't let that fool you into thinking you will need to order loads of food.  The dishes are deceivingly filliung.  We ordered some veggie samosas, naan and then two entrees and were quite content.  I found everything I tried to be very flavorful with the perfect amount of heat (I like my food spicy).  I would definitely eat here again!",1
3,"People rave about this place but I've never gotten the fuss. Can see the appeal if you are eating with a large group and share some dishes, but I'd always opt for a more run of the mill local Indian if given the choice.",-1
5,"We were tourists visiting London and had never had Indian cuisine.  This place blew us away.  Service is fantastic, food comes out fast and it is so so good. If you order the chicken curry make sure to order a side of rice and bread to sop up the curry sauce! This is a must-eat if you're in London!",1
5,"What a concept! The food here was really fabulous. Starting with the drinks: chai, lassis, to the meal - grilled chicken and fish - the coleslaw - honestly it was all perfectly executed. Not too sweet - not too salty. Chutneys were delectable. All good. The place was really beautifully decorated in my favourite style of rustic modern. Really nice server. Loved it! We need these everywhere.",1
4,"With rave reviews on Yelp, we waited 45 minutes for a table at Dishoom.  Was it worth it?  Most likely yes.  45 minutes is still a long time to wait.  Thankfully, small cups of chai and mint tea were brought out for customers queuing in the frigid January air.  Inside, the restaurant is beautiful laid out and decorated, like a Bombay brasserie of sorts.  The atmosphere is electric yet casual.  As an appetizer at the bar, we tried the calamari, which was excellent - light, crispy, with an exquisite sweet and salty drizzle.  For dinner, we shared dishes of murgh malai, house black daal, chicken ruby, a bowl of greens, basmati rice, and a side of deliciously fluffy naan.  Everything was delicious - I only wish I could have tried the whole menu!",1
5,"Food was delicious and service really great. We ordered a curry and the cranberry chicken and I would definitely recommend the mint yogurt to go with it. I honestly didn't care for the chai, it had chewy stuff in (?) but everything else was heaven.",1
5,"one word: amazing... Super trendy and cool place to take someone you wish to impress, pricing is really good in relation to great service and food... Definitively on my London to-revisit list!",1
5,I cannot begin to explain how incredible the food is here. My husband and I are visiting from the United States and we both agree that this is the best food that we have probably ever eaten. I am gluten-free and they had a very extensive gluten-free menu. The cocktails were interesting and added a nice bonus to the meal. Our only regret was filling up on entrées and not leaving room for dessert. We had to wait for about an hour to get a table and it was well worth the wait,1
5,"This place is AMAZING! Just watch out for the addition tip, you don't need to pay it! When in London, do not miss this place! If only they had one in Los Angeles!",1
4,"The place is mobbed, not surprising given the Covent Garden location and inside it's working at full tilt with a slightly frenetic atmosphere.
The food is Indian Street food but with West End London prices but quite reasonable really and pretty straightforward. Definitely Indian rather than the more Bangladeshi style that is quite common in London (both are good in my book).
We could only get a 6pm table and already the place was packed . It's a bit of a production line but we were seated right away and service was quick and efficient. Drinks came quickly. We ordered our food (being told that everything would come as soon as it was ready) and it all arrived within about 10 minutes.
I like the design with the vintage Indian posters dotted around and the low lighting. Josh sticks mixed with spices as the aroma that hits you when you enter.
The Bhel (isn't this normally called Bhelpuri?) delicious snack food of crispy rice, herbs and spices which came first was great.
We also sampled the Okra fries and calamari. Both pretty good, fairly standard calamari.
The lamb biryani was good but not the best I have had (a bit one dimensional and I prefer versions with super tender lamb) but the murgh malai (marinated chicken thighs) was great. The house black daal (signature dish) was rich and creamy. Naan bread was average.
So very enjoyable meal overall, we didn't make it to deserts being pretty full at this point. 
Overall 4 stars for the food, service, ambience and pricing combination.",1
4,"Yay! I'm a fan. I think this phrase pretty much sums up my experience at Dishoom the other night. To be honest, I didn't expect much from a restaurant in this location, where usually only restaurants exist that cater to tourists who are afraid to try anything beyond their comfort zone.   
In fact, the restauran would somehow be not misplaced on my (imaginary) list of places-that-are-too-corporate-and-thus-loose-out-on-authenticity...however...despite the quite standardised service and the corporate look, I was feeling well-taken care of, attended to by the waiting staff and showered with delicious Indian food.  
Speaking of the food: I loved it that we were able to order tapas-like food that was tiered up on the table on what I would like to call a table-ladder. We ordered a wide assortment of dishes and the dishes I remember most vividly were the vegetable samosas, the buttered-bread with creamed vegetable-sauce and the char-grilled vegetables...yummy!
Having said all this: I still prefer the kinds of restaurant that don't need an entire marketing team to thrive (but will excel simply because of word-of-mouth propaganda). Nevertheless, like I said I was pleasantly surprised by Dishoom and will definitely be back when I have visitors that don't want to go out to the dodgy (yet really authentic) places, but prefer a restaurant with clean toilets, non-greasy tables and efficient service.",1
4,"The place has quite a hype, so everyone absolutely needs to visit it it seems. A very long wait worth waiting, but only if you don't know other places to visit that also have decent Indian food without horrendous wait.  And there are, a lot of them. 
Staff is super nice, cheerful and makes your wait somewhat more bearable. So yays to the staff, nays to the wait.
its loud and dark inside -1 star. -1 star for wait +1 for staff. So 4.",1
2,"Its more flash than bang, as trendy Indian places go. The lines are too long and the food does not merit the wait. However the ambience is great and the cocktails are great. The interior decor evokes the Irani/Parsi restaurants one used to find in Bombay.",-1
5,Phenomenal ... Especially given the reasonable price.  We came here with another couple and couldn't stop ourselves from ordering more and more as we had to try everything.  The flavors were multi-layered and exploded onto the palate.  The dishes were prepared very artfully.  Chicken Tikka was beyond anything I have tried anywhere else.  The Chicken Biryani here sets the gold standard.  The IPA beer complimented the meal perfectly.  Service was great and attentive.  I want to go on and on praising this place but now I'm just making myself sad as I'm back home in the states.  Till we meet again ... Love you London.,1
4,"There's something awesome about group meals where some one else is in charge - you get to try all kinds of things without having the indecision process of deciding yourself. This was my happy experience at Dishoom - we went for a big group meal and all responsibility of choice was relinquished from myself, so I simply got to eat and eat. And man, did we eat!
I don't think there was a single dish that we had that I didn't enjoy. The dishes were full of flavour, rich, freshly cooked and plentiful. I particularly enjoyed the lamb kebabs - they were really nicely cooked and delicious with the sauces that came with the meals. I also tried a coconut milk based drink, which I can't quite remember the name of, and it was utterly delicious. It also happened to be the perfect accompaniment to the spicy samosas - they were the hottest thing that we had and were perfect too. Not crazy spicy but plenty of kick!
Our service wasn't overly special, as there was a little confusion over drink orders and such, but I couldn't fault the food and the happy feeling my stomach was filled with as we came to the end of our food. The host was really friendly and the vibe of the restaurant was very pleasant, simple striking décor, and no intrusive music - it was perfect for chatting and giggling away. All in all a great experience and delicious food!",1
4,Have now been to Dishoom 3 or 4 times.  Tonight it did not dissapoint.  Excellent!,1
5,"This is the place that I ever had biryani.  And it was delicious and the stuff in the US will not likely ever live up to it (I'm trying and I'm kinda sad about ruining it for myself by having it in London before the US)!  The chai was also very strong and delicious.  Look for the colorful bicycles outside for the restaurant.  
There was a breakfast menu that was separate from the lunch menu.  So definitely be sure of the timing since there are two separate menus (we had lunch).  
It's walkable from tralfagar, for the tourists.",1
4,"I went with 3 friends for dinner last week and it's just as fabulous the second time around. If I had to nitpick, I'd say the tables are too small to have your beer, your plates, the condiments, and food for 4 people all together. The food itself - still fantastic, the biriyani was excellent, the prawns were yummy, the lamb was succulent. Go there. Ignore the 1 hour wait in line, you can drink chai and lime juice whilst waiting. It's always worth it.",1
4,"""London's first Bombay cafe, Dishoom brings a slice of cool Bombay to Covent Garden"" says the website and so it does. 
We were lucky enough to be invite to a pre-opening dry-run but you can sample their delights from Thursday - with the added bonus of 50% off during their first week.  No reservations are required so get there early to avoid disappointment!!!! I can categorically say that this place will be full to bursting from the off... 
Dishoom advertises itself as a street cafe, which are, having done my wiki research, apparently (and sadly if this restaurant is anything to go by) a dying breed. 
The menu is simple and varied enough without being overloaded with choice. The dishes that come are small, but don't be deceived, we only ordered a small dish and main each and were stuffed and barely touched dessert! 
There is an open kitchen, try and nab one of the popular booths in the bright and airy room upstairs, serving dishes such as chilli cheese toast and fish tikka, and main dishes including salads, roomali roti wraps and grilled kebabs.
We were spoilt for choice with hot cumin laden lamb chops, a juicy mince meat keema pau spread on buttery bap, delicate flaky fish fingers which are perfect with the fragrant mint sauce, a hot! hot! byriani, and my favourite (and their signature dish) the melt in the mouth chicken tikka.. just beautiful. 
We were absolutely gutted when they accidentally sent us some prawns and then immediately took them about. The looked big and fat and juicy and the smell of coriander and lime.. Mmmmmmm... oh well.. next time!!! 
Service was a bit haphazard, as you'd expect on a dry-run with frazzled nerves in the run up to an overdue opening. But it was smiley and our waitress and greeter were lovely and chatty and amazing knowledgeable and helpful. 
The only supremely petty criticism I would have, and this is purely my own taste I should pint out, is that I wasn't a fan of the black tarka daal; which tasted more like Heinz mulligatawny, whereas I like my daal almost a warming slushy oniony, garlicky soup. And the chocolate fondant didn't sit so well with the rest of the menu, we all had ideas about how to make it more authentic; chilli said one, NO, cardamom said I. The waiter said that they were thinking of making it a chocolate and pistachio brownie.. mmm, that will go perfectly with the cinnamon (and nutmeg??) ice-cream served alongside, which was just divine and I'm not especially a fan of ice-cream - it's not a real dessert to me, more of a fob-off. The gola ices were also lovely, the mango and ginger a perfect palate cleanser. 
Unfortunately we didn't try the chai or the cocktails, we were just too full of food and drink to even contemplate it, I'm leaving that for a revisit. 
They won't be waiting too long... like I said there's 50% off the first week AND they open for breakfast. oh woe is my wallet!",1
4,"Two words my friends: Pau Bhaji
My table of 6 managed to eat it's way through three portions of this, along with lamb chops, nann, their Ruby Murry (cockney for curry don't ya know), Murgu Malai, paneer salad, yes lets pause to drool, raita, black lentil daal, and a great many samosas. This cute café/brasserie serves up fabulous food. 
But the Pau Bhaji, with it's creamy veggie mash and buttered fluffy bread was the star of the evening. Some seriously classy curry!
For it's location I was suprised at just how authentic the cuisine was; I mean, plonked in the middle of Leicester Square area you'd expect it to be another Punjab. You'd be mistaken. This is a slice of Whitechapel, snuggled into a classy surrounding, with leather booths, a really helpful hostess and brass finishing. Totally a Thumbs Up from me.",1
4,I usually don't like 'typical Indian' restaurants since I find them too greasy and heavy but Dishoom is a great contemporary take on classic Mumbai themed dishes. Fun for groups with a lively ambience I have been at least 4 times over the past year.,1
2,"Disappointing given the rave reviews. I don't think anything really impressed, and I kind of wish we went to a more traditional Indian restaurant instead.",-1
3,"We took a colleague from India here and he felt that it had some of the most authentic Mumbai food he had seen in London so far.
To be honest, I thought it was ok rather than great. We were in a booth downstairs which was actually very nice, but the service was a little slow / unhelpful. 
The food when it came was fine, but to be honest I have no strong desire to go back.",-1
5,We came here on April 1st during one of the coldest days in London with harsh winds hoping to get in for some fine Indian food. The line was already long and out the door and the quoted wait was one hour. We stood in line freezing and got served hot mint tea while waiting. The wait came to precisely one hour and we got in. Oh that felt so good and then the food was outright delicious. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. The waiter was very helpful and patient. We are from the USA and really enjoyed the meal. It deserves 5 stars and well worth the long line wait.  Highly recommend!,1
5,"This is by far the BEST indian meal I have ever eaten at an Indian restaurant, and that says a ton coming from an Indian. The pau bhaji transported me back to my childhood, all around spectacular. (My girlfriend wrote this, in case you are wondering -- and I wholeheartedly agree!!)",1
5,"Whenever I travel from America to London I eat as much Indian food as I can.  I stumbled into Dishoom one night with a friend and couldn't have been happier.  I wouldn't consider it your ""typical"" Indian restaurant.  It's very cool and sleek with a modern twist on Indian classics.  We started with a recommendation from our server and ordered the Bhel.  I had no idea what to expect because it sounded - - well it sounded weird.  YUM-YUM-YUM.  We then split the Chicken Berry Britannia and Mattar Paneer.  I can't tell you which one was better - they both rocked !!  The cheese Naan is also AMAZING.
I can't wait to come back to London and eat at Dishoom again.  If you are in the area.  Do yourself a favor and stop in.  If it's a weekend night, make a reservation or plan to wait.",1
5,"Great central location. Attentive service. Delicious no frills indian food. Cant go wrong and very reasonably priced. 
If you are in central london and are craving kebabs, hit this spot. it hits the spot.",1
4,"A really solid place with a different approach to Indian. Service was fine - nothing over the top but we were also not left wanting. 
The food was great - the halibut cheeks were well worth it as was the keema pau to start. While not disappointed by the lamb biryani I also wasn't blown away by it either. The murgh malai however was fantastic - the chicken was cooked to perfection.
Location is obviously great and the place itself was really good - great ambiance, nice communal and also individual seating options. 
Well worth a visit.",1
4,The short: Ambient atmosphere and very tasty food. Good for couples and small groups.,1
4,"When my friend told me we were getting Indian food for lunch, I was expecting a lot of sauce-based curry dishes, but boy was I wrong, since that apparently is not what a ""Bombay cafe"" typically serves (as I learned later from my waiter).
I thought the food overall was very good.  We ordered 2 ""Small Plates"", an item from the ""Grills"" section, and 2 orders of naan for 2 people, and it was a good/sufficient amount of food.  The ""Grills"" section, though a little pricier, isn't meant to be an entree by itself, since it is rather small.  All of the items on the menu are meant to be shared.
Review of items:
- Dishoom Calamari ""with zesty lime and chili"".  I thought this was really unique.  It tasted like Fruit Loops, which is a cereal from the States.
- Keema Pau - ""spice minced lamb with hot buttered bread"".  This reminded me of a 'sloppy joe', which may also be something unique to America.  What I'm trying to imply is that the presentation seemed simple/cheap, but the taste was really good.
- Dishoom Chicken Tikka (grill item) - this item was labeled as ""spicy"" on the menu, which I doubted would be true, given that I was in London, and people generally don't seem tolerant of spice/flavor, however it did pack a decent amount of spice to it. 
The service here was great, but I also came here on a weekday for lunch when it wasn't too busy.  I loved the cutesy clean diner decor with Bollywood posters everywhere.
P.S.  I apologize for all of the American-centric comments written above.",1
2,"It started off promising: I arrived just before the lines started to form and was seated right away. The server asked if it was my first time and if I had any allergies; I said I was vegetarian. She then went through and marked all the vegetarian options on the menu for me, which I didn't find necessary; I can read. But, it was a nice gesture, unless it was because she assumed I was illiterate for some reason. I ordered the okra fries as a starter. It came very quickly. It was a bit overcooked and some pieces were too stringy to chew. Then I waited a long, long time for her to come back and take the rest of my order. I debated just leaving, but the ambiance was nice and I was hungry. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to wave her down but she was always rushing past. After at least 10 or 15 minutes I finally got her attention and ordered the veggie curry and basmati rice. The rice was beautiful, long-grained. It's possible I have never had proper basmati rice before. Five stars if I was just rating the rice. The curry was good, but I thought of the microwave veggie curry meals I would get from Trader Joe's, which cost 20% the price and are about 90% as satisfying. After my meal, I walked out of the restaurant past a line of maybe 20 people outside and vaguely considered myself lucky to have been seated without a wait. I also wondered why they hadn't been better about checking in on me, to get me out of there faster and clear out a table, but whatever.
And also, as another reviewer pointed out, only two types of curry?! In London?!?",-1
5,So amazing! Great food great service! This place has the best indian food I've ever had! Get the ruby curry! It won't disappoint :),1
1,"It was my first time for me and my friend in Covent Garden. I ordered Bhel puri which was good. In mains, we ordered Lamb Biryani which I didn't like it at all. It was very dry and the rice had melted more than what it was supposed to be. I am a Biryani lover and after having heard so much about Dishoom, this wasn't the place what I expected it to be. We were sitting in the basement which was very dark than usual and way too noisy. Not a perfect place for me.",-1
3,"Love the atmosphere but im really not sure why it's so crowded! The food isn't really special, I prefer masala zone",-1
4,"Love the decor and general ambience. In terms of the menu, you can't go too far wrong, however if you're looking for an authentic indian meal, then this is not the place (i would suggest Wembley or Southall instead). What you do get though is a modern contemporary meal with a slight twist. eg. the Chicken Berry Biryani comes to mind as well as the Naan Rolls filled with cream cheese and a tangy chutney which is great.",1
4,"Sweet Jesus I want to sample everything on their menu.  I've only been once, at which time I only stayed for a drink and some delicious cheesy naan, but I've seen their prices and I've smelled their food and I will return.  Oh, yes.  With many options for less than £10 (and a good selection for less than £5), there is no reason not to eat here often.
There is outdoor seating available but the dining room isn't stuffy at all.  The service was a bit slow but super friendly.  And that cheesy naan and cocktail?  You had me at hello.",1
4,"Hands down one of the better Indian restaurants I have been to. This place was packed, waited over an hour to get seated but it was worth the wait.
We ordered the okra fries, dishoom chicken tikka, house black daal, chicken berry britannia, and garlic naan. All of these items were delicious, especially the house black daal which is a signature dish at Dishoom.",1
2,"I went for brunch and had the sausage naan.  It was ok, but from the queue, I kind of expected more.  Maybe dinner is better.",-1
4,"In the past month, I've eaten at Dishoom three times.  The food has been outstanding.  During my first visit, phaldari kofta ruby was the special.  It was one of the best dishes I've ever eaten.  During my second visit, I was with a group of eight people.  Amongst us, we had virtually everything on the menu.  We enjoyed it all.  Of particular note, we positively devoured the lamb biryani, fried okra, and black dahl.  Additionally, on the whole, the staff is friendly and attentive.  
One caveat regarding service: I found that the waitstaff tended to underestimate the amount of food that came with each order, often suggesting that each person get more than one dish.  While the food is certainly tasty enough to warrant getting a sampling, I've found that the lamb biryani and two pieces of nan is enough for two satisfying meals.",1
4,"We went there 3 times for breakfast. The food is really good and of good quality. Quantity is sometimes small but it is enough. The egg nan roll with bacon was a favorite around the table. I had porridge and granola (which was really good but very small :-)), mango lassi was specially fresh, chai a little tangy but appreciated.
The issue with the restaurant is the service. We had great service twice (foreigners with accents and great attitudes) and a really bad one, once (an irish guy not awake and limit intrusive, laying over the table while taking the order, is a NO for us).
Otherwise everybody was very smilling, even the cook behind the nan oven :-) thanks for the delicious food.",1
5,"I took my parents here when they visited London a few months ago. We tried to go pre-theatre, but the queue was too long - alas. We went back a couple days later for lunch and had the best Indian I've ever eaten. The three of us worked our way through a selection of starters and every one was full of flavour and decadent. If you can get a seat, I highly recommend it!",1
5,Their indian breakfast are to die for..don't forget the chai! love!,1
5,The lively atmosphere and delicious food and drinks make for a really fun eating experience. If you aren't familiar with Indian food just ask the waiter for recommendations and they are more than willing to help out. You can't go wrong with dahl and coconut rice,1
4,"Went for a business networking event so not the best opportunity to explore how good the food was, but it was good enough to make me want to go back. And they've certainly got the styling right.",1
2,"I found the food to be unremarkable -- it was good, but nothing special and pricier than what one could find elsewhere.  I think what makes it popular is the buzzy, bistro-like atmosphere, which is pleasant.  It has a slight tourist trap vibe (for example, the fact that servers ask if you want sparkling or still, with no explicit mention of tap water, which you can always request of course, but you have to know to do so).",-1
4,"Would it be weird to come here to have a meal consisted entirely of lassis?  Probably.  But if that gives me more of an excuse to check out the awesome bathroom stalls at Dishoom, so be it (simply to check out the medicine cabinets!)
If you're looking for something other than the amazing lassis (I tried the Rose and Cardamom, which I preferred over the Bhang), Dishoom has plentiful selection of items that require chew.  I came with a friend who was both vegetarian AND allergic to tomatoes, so this time around did not order any meat dishes.  We did order:
Far Far: bowl full of chips (or what your Brits call crisps) with texture like prawn crackers
Cheese naan: naan with layer of cheese in the middle, delicious!
Skate cheeks: fried morsels of fish (was the least excited about this one)
Calamari: great with the sauce provided
Paneer Tikka: skewer of grilled cheese and peppers
Pineapple and black pepper crumble: lots of pineapple chunks!
Really liked this place and its location, will be back for sure!",1
3,"Modern Indian - its good food, but not really what I personally want when going for an Indian meal.",-1
3,"We came here back in Dec 2012 after doing some yelp research. Thank goodness they have yelp in London. The service was great but it was a little loud, so it was kind of hard to hear sometimes. The hubby was going to order a dish he thought would be saucy and luckily our waitress gave us recommendation.  Good thing that happened because we would have ordered the naan for nothing.  The mango lassi was one of the best!! I wanted to order two of them.  I ordered the chicken ruby curry and got rice and an order of the roti... The husband ordered the murgh malai. Both dishes were really really good. We also ordered the cheese naan which the hubby finished all before the entree got to the table. I'm still thinking  about their mango lassi....
The only thing I didn't like was where we got seated.. it was right by the door and hostess station.  It gets pretty packed for dinner.  I took the seat because we were tired and hungry and didn't want to wait for another table.",-1
4,"Glad we got a chance to grab lunch here before our trip to London was over. Our group ordered a lot of food and they were all pretty good. 
The chai tea was interesting but good. It was mildy sweet and tasted like it had ginger in it.
The lamb samosas could use a little bit more flavor but I enjoyed it.
The fried calamari was nice and crispy and had a sweet and spicy flavor to it. 
The chicken curry was spicy but rich in flavor. I love Indian curry so it's a dish I would def order again.
I'm not sure of the exact name of the dish but I think it's called the chicken tikka. Love the crispy texture of the skin on the cubed pieces of chicken. It was flavored nicely and was pretty juicy. I think it's probably my favorite dish of the bunch.
The spicy lamb kabob was seasoned well but I think it was a bit dry.
The sheekh lamb could use a bit more flavor and was a little dry as well but I didn't mind it. My boyfriend liked it.
The chef's convent garden was my my least favorite dish! I don't think anyone in my group enjoyed it either. It was actually a dip which didn't have any particular flavor to it. I probably only took one bite.
The chicken pomegranate salad was nice and refreshing. Love the pomegranate seeds which gave the salad a fresh nice crunch.
The ambience was enjoyable and our group had a nice time here. Glad we were able to try Indian food in London!",1
5,"Hands down, by far, no cpmparison, the BEST Indian food I have ever had. No lie, ever. As we arrived around 6:30 (trying to beat the crowd, ha! who were we kidding) -- there was a wait. It was a cold afternoon, and we had to wait outside as it was too full inside. Service was fantastic, and they bring you delicious piping hot chai to keep you nice and comfy while waiting. Lovely touch. As much as I love London, I find their service to be generally spotty at most restaurants. However, Dishoom was on point. We had servers constantly checking in on us. Always so attentive. It was wonderful. The food in itself was fantastic. I cannot even describe how delicious it was. My only regret is that we did not go back during our 10 day stay in London. If there was one meal worth repeating, it was certainly at Dishoom. Do not miss!",1
4,"Husband and I have been here twice now and enjoyed both meals. The staff are all very very friendly, willing to answer any questions and offer recommendations (even if the answer is, ""everything is good!""). As a vegetarian, I don't have as much choice as I would in another Indian restaurant, but the choices I do have are all very delicious. The samosas and chilli toast are great starters, and their calamari is a little sweet as a twist. I've had the House Daal and also the paneer dish. As i said, both great, but I'd struggle to keep going back to find something new to try. However, their chocolate chai is also REALLY yum if you like chocolate and cinnamon. =) I'd recommend it to try!",1
4,"Definitely would go back. Food was great and while the service started out slow (took a bit to place our order which caused some stress given we had theatre tickets) once we placed the order the food came fast. 
The chili potatoes (or something like that) and naan were my favorites. Also the squid starter. But there wasn't a bad thing we had. Great location for theatre tickets as well. They don't take reservations for small parties but we had no problem getting a table about 6:00pm on a weeknight prior to the theatre.",1
4,I took two friends visiting from Germany as they wanted something a bit different. There brunch menu is fantastic. I had the bacon naan!!! Was extremely yummy!,1
5,"Yelped indian food when i was in London and this place popped.  Have to say that i was not disappointed.  when we arrived, the hostess said it was a 45 minute wait, which actually turned out to be a 10 minute wait.  We ordered the Soft Shell Crab Special, Chicken Ruby, and House Black Daal.  The Soft Shell Crab Special was definetly a delicious surprise.  I haven't come across anything like it here in the states.  The Chickey Ruby was fantastic as well.  I expected the chicken to be dry and tasteless, but it was totally the opposite.  Definetly get the House Black Daal.  Great little side dish with tons of flavor and perfect for dipping your naan or just by itself.  
Two things you need to get when you're there - Chai and the Kulfi on a stick.  The Chai is spicy, hot and perfect for a cold London night.  The Kulfi tasted like creamy condensed milk on a stick.  Awesomely sweet and a great way to end our dinner.
We kind of over ordered for two people, but it was worth it.  The next time i'm in London, i'm going to stop by.  Maybe try the Spicy Lamp Chops.
Service: Fantastic.  Our waitress from Berkeley was very attentive and always came back to check on us and ask if we needed anything else.",1
5,"This place will change your life... well, let's not go that far... but it will at least change  your opinion of what good Indian food should look and taste like. From start to finish, our meal was amazing - highlights included the House Black Daal, Gunpowder Potatoes, Masala Prawns, and the Prawn Koliwada. Not to mention some awesome cocktails. We'd like it so much that we went back the following day for lunch and ordered the same thing before we left town.",1
5,"The chicken ruby curry is a great dish to try for your first visit, and second, and third,....",1
5,"OH MY GOD! I was in heaven Friday!!  I LOVE Indian food, and was so hungry after a long day at work, and the Dishoom did NOT dissapoint! I had the chicken tikka masala (probably the best iv ever tasted) with garlic rice....soooo good! the sauce was amzing! i had a garlic naan and sagaloo too! I also tried something id never had before, okra fries, they were to die for! You must try them! the whole meal was delicious, the staff were friendly and great service! i will 100% return!!",1
5,"Fabulous meal.  The service was very attentive, we were seated right away at our reservation time.  My cocktail was delicious and my daughter loved the lassi.  All the dishes we ordered were well-spiced, flavorful, and caused me to overeat.  I would highly recommend.  Make a reservation!",1
5,"DISHOOM!!  Quite possibly the best indian food I've after had in my life.  Dishes like Chicken Biryani and Chicken Ruby were well balanced and simply ""Brilliant"" as they would say in London!  Great samosas, chutney and raita as well!. Very easy to get to from the Tube station at Leicester Square.  There was a wait/queue outside that took about an hour on a Saturday night at 9:30pm, but it was worth it!!!  The staff was very nice and offered my pregnant wife to wait seated inside but we declined since we felt fine.  The host/hostess staff brought out chai tea and some mint hot water thing for everyone outside in queue, which was nice.  I never want to eat indian food in the US again! until next time... Dishoom!!!!!",1
4,"Had Lunch here yesterday afternoon with friends visiting from the US.
Unfortunately the Management had not reserved a booth for me as I had requested when making the table reservation online...and all the booths were taken when we arrived at Dishoom.  However, the Management soon found us a table!
The meal, atmosphere and service were very good, and  a great time was had by all :-)",1
5,"I probably would have given this place 4* on the food and service alone.  
Why the extra star?  Well, when I asked the waiter what foods I could eat given my dairy intolerance, his reply was ""let me get the 'dairy-free' menu for you.""
Amazing.  I've never been to a restaurant where they already have a dairy-free menu prepared.  The food which could be altered were starred and the food that couldn't were highlighted.  
The food itself was pretty good.  I'm not usually one for eating at places which serve Indian-type food, as my parents cook some of the best curries.  Ever.  I have to say if they ever go on holiday and I'm craving some Indian food, this is where I'm coming.  
Oh, and did I mention how delicious the cocktails were?!  I had the BollyBellini and Chilli Martini.  So so good.
Definitely coming back here soon.",1
3,"Dinner
Very modern Indian place. I wasn't particularly impressed with food as I wasn't familiar with Indian.
It's not cheap considering what you get but the feel you get is something you'd like to pay for.",-1
5,"Best breakfast in the world. Bacon nan rolls and bloody mary's. Amazing decor, great staff. I've already asked if I could live there and they've agreed to take me in.",1
5,"Holy cow this place is good. Didn't have to wait for a table. The staff couldn't have been nicer, or quicker. I had the chicken ruby (similar to chicken makhani) and garlic naan to sop up that butter sauce. Just the right amount of heat. The bhang lassi (drink) soothed any burn.",1
4,"Starters and dessert were great, entrees could be better/more authentic. Kulfi was to die for!!",1
3,"An Indian fry up?
In theory, bacon in naan bread smothered in chutney should have you telling your usual bacon butties to move over, dhal-ing.
In practise, it could do with a bit more tandoor oven care. 
My breakfast didn't blow me away. So when I'm nursing a hangover, I'll pass on Dishoom. Meet me down in the British caf. And pass the brown sauce.",-1
4,"Good atmosphere, good tasty food & attentive service. You do need to wait for a table unfortunately but it is definitely worth doing. I recommend the samosas and lamb chops.",1
5,"Fantastic Indian food and nothing like a curry house. I need to go back for brunch as I've only been for dinner. I've been to both the covent garden one and the King's Cross one. The king's cross one is a really lovely, huge space. Only down side is it's super hard to get a reservation less than a week in advance and the one time I risked going without a reservation the wait was over 2 hours and we had to find somewhere else.",1
4,"The decor was an A+; very hip and cool crowd.  The food was good, but not great.  I thought the roti was great.  The chicken and lamb felt kind of dry to me.  The waitress also recommended a lentil dish, which was an A+++.",1
2,"Overpriced and overrated. I've been twice and each time had ridiculous wait times; the second time being over one hour outside in the freezing cold and they didn't even have heaters or let us order from the bar, which would have made our wait less painful. Then once inside we had to wait another 20 minutes at the bar downstairs for a table. The food, while interesting, was overly salty (on both visits) and not that memorable. Highlights were the fried okra chips, the greens and the mango ice lollies. Please note that they don't serve the customary curries, this is Bombay street cuisine. All in all, this is not worth your time or money; you'll be much happier with any of the decent Indian restaurants around Euston Station at a much cheaper price, though you won't get the same atmosphere.",-1
5,"My husband and I stumbled upon this place after seeing a play on the west end and were plain freaking thrilled. Awesome Indian food, great atmosphere, cool vibes.  Try the ""memsahib's mess"" dessert. It was great. Everything was great.",1
1,They make you wait in line outside. It began to rain. Get a lounge or call when a table is ready!,-1
4,"Things have been looking on the up and up at this place!! This was my sisters last night in Europe and this place did not disappoint. We sat down at the bar and ordered a glass of champagne, an east india gimlet and a chaijito, all three delicious! We ordered the calamari and the far far which were served along with three types of chutneys. The calamari is probably one of the best I ever had, the far far was ok - I would spend my calories on bhel puri instead.
We were seated for dinner (which was right in front of the door so the cold wind would come in often), and ordered the haleem, two sides of the greens and the house daal along with a Bollybellini. All are highly recommended. We also ordered a chai and the monsoon Malabar coffee, which were amazing. These accompanied the guju chocolate dessert, which I would say to give a miss. Service was amazing and we had a great time all in all. Great night!!",1
5,"I will now dream about this Indian food until I'm next in London.  It was so so good.  I eat a lot of Indian food, and this is probably the best I have ever had.  The cocktails were also excellent and the staff was very friendly.  Highly recommend!  I hear there can be quite wait, so recommend getting there early.",1
5,"We were visiting the UK from the US and with me being British I couldn't leave without having at least one Indian meal. I found this restaurant through reviews on Tripadvisor and on our last night in London cancelled a very pricy high end restaurant to go here instead, and it was a fantastic decision! The restaurant is right off Leicester Square, so really quite convenient. We went early, around 6:30pm, and there was already a queue outside, and of course we chose the windy, rainy, cold night :-) Not to worry, we decided to ""suffer"" as the restaurant was already packed, so this was a good sign, and the people in the queue were all meeting from work, so it made me feel better that it was not all tourists. 
They keep the system very organized, so take your name outside, and continually keep brining out drink samples for you to keep you happy and interested, a very nice touch, and then when there is room in the bar downstairs, they move you from the queue to the bar. After 25 mins we were going to the downstairs bar, and at the door downstairs the hostess greeted us by our name, again really nice and just high class giving it all the touches diners like. We ordered a drink and an appetizer and by the time we had finished our buzzer was flashing to let us know our table was ready, but again, this restaurant is so well run, the hostess beat us to it by coming to us to take us to our table. We didn't have to settle our bill downstairs, they transfer it to your dining room table, again a nice touch.
Our server, Lucie, was friendly, professional and knew the menu inside out. She kindly explained the menu to us and then asked if we wanted a few minutes to look it over, which we did. We ordered a lot, as we wanted to try a bunch of stuff - vegetable samosas - we had these in the bar downstairs. The pastry was perfectly crispy and the inside was nicely spiced. Really, really nice. At the table we ordered spicy lamb chops - nicely cooked, three small chops on the plate that were very well presented and tasted gorgeous. Lots of meat on them. Perfect size. Black House Daal - Mmmmmmmm perfect creamy texture and perfect flavourings. So good. Chicken Ruby - OMG! Creamy, lightly spiced, lots of big chucks of chicken. Perfect! Haleem is their signature dish but my husband and I didn't really like this one. It wasn't horrible, just didn't stand up to everything else on the table. Side of greens - the vegetables were steamed and chilli and lime juice sprinkled over. Very, very tasty and fresh. Also, of course, and order of garlic naan. Like I said, we ordered a lot, and we were glad we did. Wish we had been in a position to be able to take home all the leftovers, because at breakfast the next day I was certainly thinking about it again. 
The service in this restaurant in fantastic. Lucie never stopped running around and was on top of everything. All other servers were also helping on all other tables and not just their own. The manager was busting her butt too running around and was visiting every table to make sure everything was ok. We were staying at the Cavendish Hotel down the road on Jermyn St, and they need to take some lessons from this restaurant on service!!! Absolutely outstanding from the queue at the front door to leaving without our leftovers :-( Wish we had gone earlier in the week as we would have loved to have gone again, even if just for breakfast or lunch. 
The ambience is lively, the pictures on the walls seem to all be of old Bombay, either ad's, actresses, films etc., and the lighting is trendy and awesome and fits the space well. 
Don't miss this restaurant and take the time to wait in the queue outside, it is SO worth it.",1
4,"The food alone would've been 5 stars. It was probably one of the best Indian food experiences I've had. And living in Toronto, I've had my share of Indian cuisine. 
We got the lamb samosa to start (which literally came within 5 seconds), it was spicy and flavourful. After waiting for 10 mins for a beer and water and then 40 min for food, we started to wonder what happened. So it turns out our waitress (an american accentred girl) has forgotten to put in our order. As a result, we got a round of drinks for free. I had the thumbs up flip, it was a really good whiskey mixed drink, I wanted to learn how to make it myself, very delicious.
When our food finally came (50 min after we ordered the first time), it was worth the wait. We got the special, soft-shell crab curry stew with indian style potatoes and garlic nan. The curry had a very complex yet tasty flavour, nothing like what I'm used to. The soft-shell crab was unique as well, crunchy and mushy at the same time. 
If you are ever in the Covert Garden or Leichester Square area, this is a great spot I think for Indian food. The decor and environment is hip but the food is pretty traditional and delicious. And even just coming for the thumbs up flip cocktail is worth it. 
London is an amazing city, I miss it already.",1
5,The dishes here are on smaller side but the price is not too high.  For a party of two you should get at least 3 dishes and naan or rice.  The lamb chops and ruby chicken is to die for.  Meat super tender and all have some heat to it.  Only the fish is not spicy and that was what we ordered for out 3 years old. We ordered about 7 dishes and one garlic naan and end up having left over.  We spent $60 pound total.,1
4,"This is a great choice for a fun, affordable restaurant - especially when you're in a neighborhood of primarily chains. The food selection is just right - not enough to overwhelm but plenty of veg and non-veg options. It is a great place for family-style dining and even tapas, or just ordering your own meal. The waitstaff is lovely and very accommodating and even without a booking and going late on a Friday night, the wait was not too long. You can dress up or come as you are - either way you will fit in!",1
4,"Excellent spot - great food, drink, and atmosphere. Really well managed. Very crowded and no reservations for under 6 people so show up early. (KCL location). Okra fries a must!",1
4,"light, well-seasoned tandoori entrees.
Craving indian, yelp led me here. Ample space and seating (main floor and basement).
I ordered the garlic naan and chicken tandoori.
the naan was good, garlic-fragrant. The chicken tandoori blew me away. Usually at most restaurants I've been to, the tandoori is always this eerie red color. Here, it was more of a grilled chicken color. It was light and very well seasoned with a touch of spiciness. I was super stuffed, but didn't feel bloated.
I was spying samosas on the tables around me which I will try on my next go. Will be back eventually.",1
3,Dishoom is mentioned in the Time Out tour guide. I was quite disappointed to try the Bomba[y] Omelette. What is special about it? It tasted like a simple omelette to me. It was cool to learn about the tradition of Bombay Cafes in London from the history lesson on the menu.,-1
5,Ordered 6 dishes and all of them were finger licking good. Lots of vegetarian options. Reasonably priced - well for London at least.,1
5,"I've known about Dishoom for a while and have seen its rave reviews so I'm glad to have had the chance to go there for the Covent Garden Review Crawl this week. The atmosphere is very cosy, with lots of different pictures everywhere, a bit dark downstairs but I quite like that at times. We tried the Bombay Pimms which was a really interesting take on normal Pimms, definitely not something I would have chosen but I enjoyed it nonetheless! We were then provided with lots of different small plates, including a bhel salad and skate cheeks which were really really lovely! Kheema Pau, a mince lamb dish with bread, was also tasty, though I think the skate cheeks were the hit of our group!
Needless to say I think I'll be coming back here to try more of what this lovely Bombay Cafe has to offer.",1
4,"I love small plates and I love Indian food - so Dishoom is pretty much perfect for me. 
The service is pretty good, especially since they seem to pump tables through pretty quickly. 
The cocktail menu is short, but thoughtful. Every drink has a Bombay twist. I would recommend the Bombay Colada. It's smoother, lighter and much more complex in flavour than a regular pina colada. 
My two favourite dishes are the Murgh Chicken (grilled chicken thigh) and the Black Daal - both are to die for. I'm not usually a chicken thigh kind of gal, but I'd choose this thigh over a piece of chicken breast any day. Although the Chilli Cheese Toast came highly recommended, I didn't think it was much more than plain old cheese on toast with a few chillies... something I can do myself at home.
And of course you must not leave without trying one of the Kulfi Sticks. Great stuff.",1
4,Black daal was the best part - delicious! The lamb biryani was very dry unfortunately. Good prices and service overall but I would say the long lineup wasn't worth it. You can reserve for before 6pm though which is what I would recommend.,1
4,This is one of the hippest Indian restaurants that I've been to.  The food and the service was solid and luckily you don't walk out smelling like a ton of spices....  the one negative is that they didn't really have any cold beer.  They did however look both upstairs and downstairs to try to find colder ones.,1
5,"Hands down the best Indian food I have had in my life. Everything about this place is amazing and worthy of going to again and again. The atmosphere is incredibly enjoyable and fun, and the overall feeling you get when you walk through the door is as if you walked into an elaborate party. Great service staff, and very accommodating of our reservation a few weeks out! The food is amazing...the Chicken Ruby is good enough to have twice! I'll be back next time I'm in London.",1
3,"Dishoom is the sound a Bollywood film hero makes when he lands a good punch. How cool is that? The restaurant (although they call themselves a Bombay café) is pretty cool as well. Consisting of two floors, it's routinely packed to the afters on Friday and Saturday nights. Even for a  table for 3 at 6pm, the wait was 30mins so if going make sure to make a reservation or leave a margin for waiting. A quick pre-theatre meal this is not.
I've been wanting to go for ages since one of my Indian friends had raved about the dal and biriyani. So I grabbed him and another of my brown brethren and the three of us headed off to Dishoom for dinner.
As noted above, we had a wait so off to the downstairs bar we went. Dishoom doesn't have an extensive cocktail list (although I imagine any of the standard drinks would be provided upon request if you so asked) but it does have several classics rejuvenated with a Desi twist. I opted for the Chaijito which as the name suggests is a Chai infused mojito. I was a bit doubtful of a lime and chai tea flavour mix but I have to say it was spectacular. The clean crisp flavours of the lime just barely sweetened with sugar refreshed the palatte while the chai added a playful note without any of the cloudy and cloying after taste you get in a chai tea latte. My friends' Bollywood Bellini and some form of punch were also good but I would stick with my choice as being the best.
After about 20-25 minutes we were seated in a cosy table upstairs. Naturally, we ordered the house dal (a black lentil dal rather than the traditional red or orange) and a lamb biriyani with masala prawns for a starter. The prawns were good in their own right however could have used more masala to truly be masala prawn. The dal was delicious with a sharp bite and a deeper burn from the chillies used. The biriyani was tasty but nothing on what my mom makes (and since she made it a few days ago it had to contend with my recent taste memory). 
The garlic naan was sorely disappointed and looked more like a garlic topped Ryvita cracker than any real attempt at a naan. I hope ours was just an anomaly as a good naan is an essential pillar of a good Indian restaurant.
Overall, it's a bit expensive but a fun and tasty experience. Keep in mind this is more grilled type of Indian cooking rather than an abundance of curries (going North rather than South) but overall a good time. Definitely worked a treat as a pre-night out classy spot!
I really want to go back for breakfast and get a bacon naan roll!",-1
5,"This was a gem of a restaurant in the middle of London.  Yes London has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the reviews do not lie.  Even the cocktails were exotic.  Must try if you are in the area and love Indian food.",1
4,"The food here was absolutely great, Indian food is usually a hit or miss for me and would say this place was very impressive. Have had a number of appetizers and entrees including the Tikas, Curry and few other entrees both meat and vegetarian. 
Would have given 5 stars but the only negative was that this place was crowded! I definitely suggest making a reservation otherwise you could go downstairs while waiting & grab a drink at the downstairs bar.",1
4,"We decided to go for curry, but didn't actually end up ordering any. Instead we got:
* Far far
The sauces were good, but the waitress asked us in such a way that it sounded like it was free. Not so nice when we got the bill and discovered otherwise, but it wasn't a big deal.
* Garlic and Cheese Naan
While tasty and crispy, the garlic naan was too hard. The cheese naan was also tasty, but was super filling and just made it seem like a grilled sandwich pancake. We probably should've ordered the classic instead.
* Chole Chawal
This was really nice. It came with diced red onion and a really nice sauce. Big fan of this one.
* Prawn and Pomelo Salad
Fresh veggies and prawn, but while not overcooked really, parts of the prawns were a bit charcoaled. The salad was good except that there was a bit too much dressing on it.
* Paneer Tikka
Nice and firm. Fresh veggies used too without overcooking.
* Cinnamon Ice Cream
Great stuff! Had a great flavour and it was creamy but not too much, so it was still nice and light.
The only big downside for us was how noisy it was. I kept having to shout for my partner to hear me over all the noise.
The service was good, and the food is not expensive.",1
5,"The best Indian food in the world!
Pros and outstanding:
Biriyani - exquisitely spiced with subtle flavors and wonderfully tenderized meat
Roti - outstanding without the traditional soaking of ghee - served very fresh, hot, and tasty!
Malabar Monsoon Cappuccino - very nice twist of the Italian version
Fried Okra - never looking back on French Fries again!
Outstanding service! The hostess, waiters, and staff are truly interested and dedicated to their customers and recognize them for repeated service.
Ambiance and decor - provides the perfect backdrop that compliments the food and service
Mediocre:
Naan - although traditional and well executed, a little too dense for my taste
Long lines - unless dining early for breakfast, or before 5 PM for dinner, there is a long line (20 minutes or longer) - However, they serve hot chai while waiting that compensates for the inconvenience
Pineapple crumble - would have preferred more pineapple and less crumble - just my preference - however, other restaurants in London (non Indian) have also served crumble with these proportions of fruit/crumble. This may reflect a regional food preparation rather than a execution flaw.
For any Indian food afficiando, eating at Dishoom is a must!",1
4,"I was lucky enough to win a brekkie for two from Qype to this new venue in the St Martin's Courtyard development ... Next door to Jamie's Italian.
 I arrived at 0800 as it opened to find it sparsely populated with a few suits getting ready for meetings. Had a chat to the owner - a lot of the photos are of his family, and his mum is on the front cover of the menu ... In her 70s heyday I hasten to add.
 Ordered a selection from the menu cooked brekkie, porridge, granola, roti; then sat back and sipped a hot cup of chai.
 ... more to come",1
4,"Lots of curry houses in london, this one's worth a stop delivers Great street-food style Indian food. Share the small plates and the buzz of the place. Beer list could use an upgrade.",1
3,"It's really challenging to cue for 1 hour when outside it's freezing. Fortunately they brought us a tiny glass of Chai Latte. When we finally entered they said we had to wait for just 20 minutes but it was a lot more. The food was good but unfortunately overloaded with coriander that covered all the flavors. There was a lot of noise. I didn't find it great as a lot of friends of mine said, it was not so bad. I don't think I'll go back there to have Indian food, I'll try something else. Try Veeraswamy instead.",-1
2,"There's something very egalitarian about chain restaurants. They simply don't care who you are and aren't at all bothered about trying to impress you specifically. No bookings, you turn up, wait your turn, and get the same service as everyone else. In his excellent review in the Guardian, Jay Rayner recounts how he had to stand outside in the queue with the rest of the rabble too, slightly discombobulating I've no doubt, for a man used to a certain level of recognition. After a late afternoon meeting over wine (the best sort of meeting) me and my two guests thought about staying in the rarified atmosphere of the Ivy Club but in the interests of investigative research joined Mr Rayner and other food luminaries by queuing at Dishoom. 
Dishoom has been referred to (mainly by the PR team) as a Bombay style cafe. An egalitarian, open all hours canteen serving taxi drivers, students, writers and lawyers (according to their puff anyway)...None of those stereotypes were notably present on the night, predominantly, our fellow diners were more the middle class braying London types you traditionally find clogging up the greener parts of zone 2.
There's got to be a book written for this. 'Food Branding 2.0 - lessons for the post Pizza Express generation'. Like the equally insipid Jamie's Italian next door, and 'gourmet, authentic Mexican fine dining experience' (more PR bullshit) Cantina Laredo next door to that, the team behind Dishoom seem to have swallowed the whole volume, hook, (press) line and sinker. It's somewhat sinister having all three of them next to each other. It's the kind of line-up better suited to touting for passing trade outside a Croydon multiplex rather than prime real estate in the centre of London. 
The food is casual, safe and generic Indian (at risk of insulting a large country). It doesn't seem to come from anywhere specific, and certainly didn't bear any relation to what (admittedly little) I know of the hot, spicy street food of the region. For a coastal city, you'd expect fish to feature heavily, the best they could do was a 'Dill Salmon (that well known Indian fish) Tikka'. Our starters included Bombay Sausages, a student dinner party staple of the future fusing chipolatas, onion and curry paste, Chilli Cheese (on) Toast, pleasant but utterly underwhelming, and a dish called Keema Pau, minced lamb in a ragu style sauce served alongside a muffin.  These came with fridge fresh pickle pots and a highlight, perfectly chilled Meantime Union beer. 
Our main courses were similarly pedestrian. The Chicken Biryani was nicely presented in a clay pot with a pastry seal but arrived dry, beautifully but subtly fragranced and lacking in a core ingredient. ""Do they serve the chicken on the side?"" questioned the Drama Queen, apparently not, it was just hiding (very well) in the rice. The taste was as subtle and shy as a thirteen year old at a school disco, it felt like nothing more than an accompaniment. The Spicy Lamb Chops came with some semblance of taste and some of the vim and zing you'd expect from a decent kitchen. Beautifully cooked, tender and juicy, they were the one high point for me. The final plate, a Lamb Boti Kebab was dry again and chewier than expected.  
There's a niche in the market for a chain Indian, and Dishoom gives a good argument for filling it. For anyone who's ventured within a mile of Tayyabs or Lahore in the East End, or been to some of the great curry houses of Birmingham, Southall or Bradford you're going to be left wanting. That being said, if you're stuck in theatreland with kids or random relatives who ""don't usually like that spicy foreign stuff"", you could do worse. And if that isn't damning with faint praise, I don't know what is.",-1
5,"After seeing Chicago on the West End we were hungry, and it was almost 11 pm and most places in the area had stopped serving food.  As it was our last night in London, we figured we should try some Indian food, and were thrilled with Dishoom said the kitchen was still open.
We all started with a Bombay Pimm's, which was an Indian inspired version of the classic Pimm's Cup; it was infused with ginger and very delicious, an excellent start to the meal!
Our waiter was very patient and answered our questions, and once we ordered, the food came out fast!  We had samosas and some of the most amazing calamari ever, it came with a spicy/sweet sauce and was just melt in your mouth good!
Of course we had some Naan bread, we opted for garlic and it was outstanding, we had to get a second order.  For our main dish we shared the Lamb Biryani, I had never had Biryani before, and now I am hooked!  The lamb chunks were so tender and flavorful, they melted in your mouth and the seasoned rice complimented it perfectly.  It was a bit spicy, but we got a side of cucumber raita to put on top, and the combination was amazing!  This was my sister's first time ever eating Indian food and now she is hooked!  I thought the prices were quite reasonable and the portions were big!  The inside decor is very modern, and overall it made for a wonderful final meal in London!",1
5,Well worth the prices. The black daal is out of this world.... Not to be missed!! Great atmosphere. Be prepared to wait.,1
5,"LOVED it!  Ragin' hot place at 11pm.  Really nice Indian food, and very fast.  The dishes are mostly small, but priced so you can order several.  Not a huge menu but everything we had was good.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive.  And sweet.  
Highly recommended.",1
5,"Loved the food, never thought the black daal could be that good! Chicken ruby had wonderful complex spices and get the roti to soak up every last drop of it. Portions aren't large, but the roti for mopping up the sauces makes up for it! I'd certainly go again! MUST MUST MUST!",1
4,"Fantastic Indian fusion! Had the calamari, chicken tikka roll, and mango lassi-- all so delicious and fresh. Great flavones and not too overpowering like some Indian dishes. Was subtle and very well presented. Will most definitely come back!",1
4,"I've been wanting to try out Dishoom for ages but can never be bothered to queue. However, if you go at 10pm on a Thursday night, there is no queue! 
I went with a friend who had been before so left the ordering up to her. This being a good thing as I am horrible at making decisions and I would have happily ate half the menu. After putting in our order, we sat and chatted while enjoying the atmosphere and lovely aroma (which indeed made me even more hungry!). 
I was slightly sceptical if it would taste as good as it smelled, but my oh my, I need not to worry! We had a lamb dish, daal, calamari and roti - all of which were fantastic! I would go back for the calamari alone. 
Overall - lovely atmosphere, delicious food, good service and decent prices. I will definitely be back and may possibly even queue for a short while.",1
5,"We had the Chef's special (a lamb dish) and a number of the chicken dishes, and loved them all! Try to make a reservation or go early because the restaurant seems to be busy every night of the week. Will definitely go back.",1
4,"Great Location, great food, great staff. Finally had a Thumbs up after a good 15 years! I was in heaven...not that I care for Thumbs up..but it was a part of my childhood and was thrilled to see it, in a glass bottle that too!! 
Ate here on 2 occasions, the first time was lunch got the Rumali roti and Chicken tikka. Hubby got the Chicken Berry Biryani...I can't wait to go to Bombay and try the berry pulav at Britannia so I can compare! 
Second time round went with a couple of friends we ordered up a storm. Pau Bhaji, Spicy roasted potatoes,Lamb Chops, Sausages and Lamb Biryani. Dessert was excellent, we got the Gola ice( which was forbidden to us as kids growing up in India) It was pretty good as was the berry crumble ( not very Indian I know...but so good). I got a Limca this time!! 
Definitely a good spot to eat some good Indian food, a little expensive but oh so worth it! Looking forward to going back this September with my sisters!",1
4,"Being from Alaska, I really enjoy a good Curry when traveling. Dishoom didn't let me down. Pleasant (clean) atmosphere and excellent choices.",1
4,"Wow - I can see why Yelpers have been making this place popular! We came in hungry - and left with warm happy stomachs.  
The chicken tikka is what really stood out in its awesomeness. The chicken was nice and moist, and sooooo full of flavo(u)r. Order this with naan or garlic naan - and you are (almost) set. 
I say ""almost"" as the portion sizes are such that the customer is enabled to order a variety of different dishes without ""overeating"".  (Next time I'll consider ordering two of these and 2xnaan).
The calamari was also an excellent dish - a small bowl of very lightly breaded calamari. It was a nice change from what I'm used to - as the calamari isn't completely covered in batter and fried. This is certainly worth a try for a change of pace. 
The final dish was the real kicker... (by kicker - i mean it kicked us in the ass!). Lamb curry (I think it was listed as Lamb Biryani on this menu). We ordered this with rice as it came with just the main curry, and wow - they kicked it up a nice notch. A fairly spicy dish with not quite as much flavor as the chicken tikka - at least worth a shot for the super hot lovers, but I would have liked a ""fuller"" flavo(u)r. 
Aside from the food, the service was excellent (especially considering the crowds vs the # of servers), and the atmosphere was cool. It was nice that it was relatively casual for a cool London restaurant spot. I can see us going back for sure.",1
3,"Nice Indian street food style food which is quite trendy at the moment.
Good size portions for sharing. Bit pricey for what you get but it is Covent Garden.
I didn't rate the calamari or the chilli cheese toast. Calamari was really oily, small bity bits and the toast was just that - toast.......
It's better than the usual English curry houses so handy for a quick Indian fix but still a bit too trendy for me. I like my Indian food in a no frillls way.",-1
5,"Shaheed and Lucy were just delightful and made me feel like part of their family! The food was delicious! Mutter paneer and the lady fingers with chutney were flavorful and the portions were just right. The prices were a little high, but being right in the middle of central tourist section, this was not unexpected. Will plan to return with my family!",1
4,"Friend recommended this place, and I've been here twice during my trips to London.
I've tried the following:
Mutter Panner - love the sweet peas that counter the lovely spices in the dish
Black Dal - delicious (and affordable)
Egg Naan Roll - ZOMG! Get this thing if you make it in time for breakfast. It's a naan bread, rolled into a taco, with two fried eggs (slightly runny) and a mysterious (but amazing) red sauce. The flavours are spectacular.
The chai is great for sipping and I only wanted more. That tiny glass of chai is only  enough to get you through 1/2 the newspaper. lol.
#Vegetarian review",1
3,"I think this place would be a great venue to enjoy apps and... well, apps. they do some of the harder to find dishes like vada pau, and pretty well, altho pricey. cocktails are nothing special, wine list not great, and entrees are OK but overpriced. 
location, however, is fabulous. and our server was a sweetheart.",-1
4,"Pretty good food. Had never tried curry in the UK, so I thought to check it out since we were in Covent Garden. The chicken ruby was very good. Aside from many standard items there are a few fusion-like entrees (e.g. The memsahib's mess in the dessert menu, which were good). We didn't make a reservation at night and it was an estimated 45min wait, but were seated sooner. It would be a good idea to make reservations for dinner I think.",1
5,"Ever since I discovered Dishoom earlier this year, I've become an ardent fan. 
What strikes me as the most charming and defining feature of ""Dishoom"" was the concept that it pays homage to, that of, Irani cafes in mid-20th century Bombay. ""Dishoom"" opened its doors in July 2010. Adorned with sepia toned portraiture and popular imagery from the 50s and 60s against the backdrop of powder blue walls, it is obvious that much thought and effort has gone into the decor and cultural referencing. 
I admit to this bias but given the plethora of Pakistani restaurants in London that serve food exactly how I would enjoy it back home, I rarely venture to Indian restaurants. However, Dishoom has changed that for me. During multiple visits I have enjoyed the simple, clean flavors and moderately spiced food.  The stellar item on the menu is, undoubtedly, the chai. It's traditional milky tea with a lingering aftertaste of cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and a hint of ginger. Amongst the starters/small plates the pau bhaji, calamari, vada pau and bhel stand out. I also enjoy the grilled items accompanied with velvety roomali roti or cheese nans. 
They also serve delicious breakfast. I have tried the Bombay Omelette and the Bombay Breakfast Bake, both of which were excellent especially the latter.   
Dishoom is one of the rare restaurants where most items on the menu are standouts and rarely disappoint. It's also good value for money, especially give the central location.",1
4,All parts of our meal were amazing! The highlights were defiantly the fresh warm naan that came from the oven directly to your table and the chicken ruby! Will definitely be coming back on my next trip to London!,1
3,"Awesome food but bad service. The waiter overruled our order and we ended up reordering more food. They srem to be surfing on their popularity. 5 star food, 2 star service",-1
5,"This place is delicious but does not take bookings. However, you can avoid the queue if you time it correctly. I've had really good luck getting a table between 3-5pm. As others mentioned, the black dal is epic and probably the best thing on the menu. Fried okra is crispy and well-seasoned; try it with the chutney that comes free to the table. Other gems are the biryanis (I've had chicken and lamb) especially when accompanied by a side of raita. Save room for dessert as their kulfis on a stick are light and delicious.",1
5,"So much to try, so little time.   I visited Dishoom 3 times over 5 days!  The menu is huge and you won't have enough room for everything.  It's great for light snacks, tea, or a meal.  Everything was fantastic that we tried, except for the lamb samosas which I was wowed by.  If you try anything there, get the mahi tikka. The fish is cooked perfectly and it's melts in your mouth!  Also, get a pimm's cup.  Service is friendly and there's also free wifi.",1
5,"Dishoom has by far the best Indian food I've ever had, although I've never been to India. It is the 2nd best restaurant I ate at during my month long vacation in Europe. I highly recommend this place. Everything we ordered was fantastic. I wish I could eat there again.",1
5,"I got here about 5:30pm, right before the post-work rush, so it was much easier to get a table. Ended up sitting upstairs, which has a more open feel, but downstairs can be good if you have a larger group that can use the booth. Also glad they took credit card since I did not have any Pounds on me.
I ordered the Samosas and Pau Bhaji ... delicious! Really excellent food with great wait staff. The interior decor and ambiance is what really sold me on this place.",1
5,"Great and friendly service which is just a primer for the absolutely amazing food. Care and quality of cooking and ingredients are clearly evident not to mention the creative twists on some Indian classics like biryani and okra. As an Indian having 35 years of experience eating Indian and Pakistani food, I can say this meal was eye opening and exceptional. I may even go so far as to say my mama's cooking may have some competition. The black daal cheese naan chicken tikka okra fries and behl were all top notch as was the chicken biryani. I'm thankful for running into this place during my 4 days in London.",1
5,"Great food, everything tasted great. Had the Chicken Ruby, perfect with rice. For dessert, try the cinnamon ice cream with chocolate pudding, very good.",1
4,"I had heard of this place until the Qype event, but i will definetly be back. despite being in the heart of covent garden it really is an inexpensive place to eat.
The quality of the food we had was very nice and looking at the menu it reminds me of an indian tapas bar.
we started with a bombay pimms, and served Keema Pau,Bhel,Skate Cheeks after speaking to the chef (very knowledgeable and the look of a bollywood moviestar ;), we then also had Calamari and a vada (a spicy potato patty in a bun).
The drinks walla also came over to speak to us and gave us a history on the drinks and out bombay pimms.
The staff are very friendly and informative on their menu and history and i have no doubts in recommending this resturant and i will definetly be going back to sample some more dishes as the lamp chops sound very nice",1
5,"This is one of those ""i wish i could give it more than 5 stars"" moment. I grew up in Bombay and this restaurant makes me nostalgic. The restaraunt is an Irani joint, down to the last little detail. Love it. Looove it. 
There is nothing more ""bombay"" than ""vada pav"" and ""pau bhaji"". A proper Vada Pav has 3 components (pav, vada and chutney). Dishoom makes a proper Vada Pav.
I wish I could take Dishoom back with me to San Francisco.",1
4,"Went here with a large (~15) group, and the staff at Dishoom was extremely accommodating.
FOOD/DRINKS: Plentiful.  We ordered an assortment of appetizers, entrees, drinks, and dessert.  Everything was delicious!  We have several vegetarians, and they certainly didn't go hungry, so if you're not into eating meat, you'll still get a great meal here.
PRICE:  I don't think it's super-cheap but found it reasonable for this part of London.
AMBIANCE: It was a pretty loud, upbeat scene.  Kind of on the dark side at dinnertime.
SERVICE: Fantastic.  There was a small hitch around the number of beers we ordered, and one of the non-beer drinks took a little longer to come out, but I thought we had great service.
Would definitely recommend this place to others!",1
4,"Not being a fan of Indian food, I tried Dishoom as a NY transplant for my first Indian restaurant experience and now I want more! Service was excellent. Although there was a long line, we were seated quickly on the ground floor which had a great ambience. We ordered the roomali roti, garlic naan, chicken ruby, pau bhaji, and chilli cheese toast. All dishes are very affordable and quite tasty! I will be back for more!",1
4,"My first experience with Indian food came at Dishoom based on the recommendation of our very friendly (and Indian) Harry Potter tour guide. Dishoom is located just off Leicester square in a trendy neighborhood full of restaurants. There was a wait for a table at 2pm, which I took as a good sign. Our waiter seemed to embrace the challenge of picking out appropriate dishes for first time Indian food eaters, and he did an excellent job overall. I'd say the prices were fair, I just wish we hadn't ordered quite so much food. It felt like a shame to let so much go to waste.",1
4,"Went to the one in Covent Garden - loved everything I ate (curry, naan, the appetizer which resembled garlic bread, sweet lassi, etc.). Definitely a place to try if you're looking for some good Indian food in London! Be warned that the line gets long and if you go at a peak hour, don't be surprised that there's a line out the door. I've gone for late lunch/early dinner (between 3-4:30), which I hear is usually a good time to go.",1
4,"We had a team dinner at Dishoom for our office.  I was expecting a run-of-the-mill Indian restaurant - and was completely caught off guard.
The food at Dishoom was very nicely prepared, very fresh flavours, nice spices, and served piping hot!  The atmosphere was also very clean and trendy.  Amazingly, with the 17 guests that we had in our party, the service was very good and the food/wine continued to flow nicely.  They handled a large party very well and the service was good quality.
Dishoom is probably a bit on the pricey side for Indian-fare, but this place is well worth it.  This is a great find in Leicester Square and I highly recommend!",1
5,"Made reservations, at Dishoom on Friday prior to a show around the corner at thePhoenix theatre. We probably could have been seated without a reservation however the lineup was well established when we left.
     The waitstaff was exceptional! Our waitress "" Flor"" from Belgium was amazing. Really added to our dining experience.
     Finally to the food!! Top notch. I enjoyed an India Pale Ale brewed especially for Dishoom and shared a half litre of the house red. Delicious!
The veg samosa starter very fresh and not at all greasy as is sometimes the case with deep fried starters. From the grill we enjoyed the Masala Prawns and Chicken Tikka. Order the ""house black daal "" sauce. It is simmered for over 24 hours and you can tell! Don't miss out on the vegetable side dishes especially the ""bowl of greens. It is bursting of fresh flavour and has a warm sauce!
     Although a long way to go From Canada,I will return to Dishoom when I am back in London.",1
3,"Food is good and the portions quite generous - I liked the black dal and the chole chawal that I ordered. Both were nicely spiced and steaming hot. However, the service was a little inconsistent and quite pushy which is a turnoff.",-1
5,"Wonderful food and great service. Don't miss the black Dahl. The chicken tikka was delicious. Come early if you can, by 5:30p there was a line down the block.",1
5,"One of the best breakfasts I had while I was in London. Food was tasty, ambiance was sweet, and the service was great.",1
5,"SO many people recommended this place to me, I was seriously excited to finally go there for breakfast last week.
An odd choice? Indian breakfast? Oh no, no.
At 8.30am the place was practically empty, but with beautiful big windows and a loads of light, it was inviting from the word go.
I started with black coffee and freshly squeezed OJ, complimented with a side of bacon naan roll.
The naan, freshly made on site, housed beautiful smoked backed bacon and was served with homemade chili jam. Good lord. It was divine. The combination just worked and the portion was just enough to leave me full. None of the greasy, 'what have I just eaten' guilt you normally get when you eat something hot for breakfast.
I'm taking a friend back in a few weeks to have EXACTLY the same thing, and will be trying to do lunch or dinner asap. I hear the curry is die to for.",1
5,Amazing Indian Cuisine! So far one of our favorite places to eat out here in London. Loved the service and the food was fabulous! We will definitely come back when we're back in London.,1
4,"One of the restaurant in London which you will see a (very) long queue outside the restaurant everyday (no kidding!).. Get down here early if you have party of less than 6, as you can't book a table for smaller group. We arrived at 6pm with a waiting time of 1 hour 20 minutes (wow!). Anywho, since this is our second attempt we agreed to wait and was let in to the bar downstairs.  Nice decoration and interesting cocktail and non alcohol list. I tried the rose and cardamom lassi n it is soooo good. We were offered a table at 7pm and was led to our table. Ordered few curry dishes, chicken ruby, cheese naan, garlic naan, briyani (chicken) and spicy lamb. All good especially the chicken ruby!! Tender n juicy.  Lamb in the hand was not good, as it was hard and dry (tip: need to review that recipe). Guzu mousse was my dessert but pieces of salt shaving on my mousse?? That's a bit unnecessary... and disturbed my palate. :) Oh well this restaurant definitely worth a try! Come early and enjoy the wait.",1
4,"I attempted to go to Dishoom last Thursday evening around 6 - but the wait was too long (about an hour and 45 minutes).  I waited for a little bit, but essentially gave up because I didn't want to waste my time in London in line at a restaurant.  I went back on Friday around the same time, another long wait. I left again, but came back around 9pm... There was about an hour wait, but ended up only being about 45 minutes which wasn't terrible.  Definitely moves faster at night.  
The food was tasty, for London standards, and the ambiance was nice; however, I may be spoiled since I'm from New York... In New York I can get great Indian food ordering from Seamless, so I'm definitely biased.  Was it worth the wait? Not really, but if you have time to kill, definitely check it out, if for nothing more than the surrounding neighborhood which is great.  
And really nice of them to bring out drinks while you wait (mostly lemonade).",1
5,"Authentic, delicious Indian food.  Not the typical curries, but rather some adventurous stuff.  A bit noisy.  Reservations suggested, but worth the 30 minute wait we had.",1
2,"Had an OK experience here. Went in a group of six on a Thursday night with a reservation; good thing, too, because the place was packed. We sat in the basement/""bottom floor"" in a kind of alcove. 
We wanted to get grilled vegetables and fried calamari as starters, but the waiter said these items (which ARE labeled as ""starters"" in the menu) come out with all the other entrees. This system didn't really bother me but I just found it odd. For my main I got the murgh malai chicken. It was alright. I tried some sauces on my chicken; this was a bad move. Some of these table sauces were damn spicy. Not a refreshing, nasal-pasage-clearing spicy, just a prickly, why-is-this-sauce-like-this? unnecessary spicy. That kind of ruined the meal for me. The grilled veggies and calamari were fine but nothing to rave about.
Everyone else seemed to like their dishes but nobody was like, ""Oh, man, this is so good, you've gotta try some!"" 
The server was fine but there were times I wished he availed himself to our table a bit more tenaciously. Prices are quite good, all main dishes under or around GBP 10. The decor and ambience were very nice, lots of Indian ephemera and dim lighting. I should note the gents' bathroom: it has huge urinals and an odd soap dispenser. 
Overall a slightly below average experience. I can see that most people really like this place so I would give it another shot, but if I'm picking out a restaurant this wouldn't be my top pick. Be your own judge, however, because sooner or later you're gonna have to stop listening to me and start making your own choices. And that soap dispenser was pretty weird, so maybe go just to check it out.",-1
3,"Amazing food! We had a bit of a wait, but there is a nice bar area to order drinks and small plates. Service at the bar was excellent- bartenders were very attentive. The biggest problem arose once we were seated. Our waiter was incredibly absent and negligent. When we asked for things... Like water... He didn't bring it, and every time he walked by, he didn't even check in to see if we needed anything. The only thing that saved our experience was another waiter, who really picked up where our waiter left off. The other waiter managed to handle all his tables, and bring us water, take our wine order, and check in regularly to see if we needed anything. 
At the end of the meal, I was more than happy to tip, but I strongly felt the tip belonged to the other waiter- not ours. Our waiter did nothing, he clearly had other tables he favored. I used to be a waitress in the service industry, and my belief is no one is entitled to a tip, you must earn it. So, I did not leave the ""optional service charge"" on my bill, and I instead gave the tip to the waiter who actually took care of our table.
I was out the door of the restaurant, when our assigned waiter chased us down to confront us as to why we didn't leave the ""optional"" tip. I was shocked, and he followed up with the manager would like to know. I should have asked to speak to the manager, or just emphasized that the tip was OPTIONAL.... But instead I went through the reasons I did not leave a tip for him, and why I gave the tip to the person who actually took care of our us. I was just in such shock- I have never been chased out of a restaurant and interrogated as to why I did not leave a tip.  That waiter spent more time chasing me out, than he did at our table the whole night.
I highly recommend this restaurant for the food, and if you get seated in a section with a good server, you will have a 5 star experience!",-1
3,"I took my sister and her Indian in-laws there and they loved it. What I think makes this Mumbai-inspired chain successful is that it's a subtle cross between East and West. The menu has all the classics you'd expect at your local deli; biryani, curries, kofta, naans etc. but the menu is designed to suit Western palates.
I think it's a tad too pricey given the quantities but the  flavour and refinement make it worth the money. However, if you're looking for homely, comforting food, it's probably not the right place. The restaurant has a sophisticated and cosmopolitan vibe to it. 
If you go there in 5+ groups you'll get better value if you order different dishes everyone can eat from, tapas-style.",-1
5,Love this restaurant. Been here both visits to London. Great service. Indian fusion food. Delicious cocktails as well as a well thought out beer and wine list. Get there early to stand in line. No reservations are taken. But worth the wait.,1
5,"Excellent meal. Everything was perfectly crafted. Loved all the dishes we ordered. Okra fry as an appetizer was crisp and tangy. Rajma chawal was finger licking good. Pau bhaji took me back to the streets of Mumbai. We ordered Kulfi and masala chai to end the night of gastronomy delight. If and when I am back in London, Dishoom deserves another stop over.",1
4,One of the most authentic restaurants serving Mumbai wala khana! Everything from the tea to the appetizers to the main course and dessert were innovative but true to Indian standards. Must visit. Hope they open a US location in California too!,1
5,Terrific food! Tastes incredible and reasonably priced for London. The only annoying thing was how they don't take reservations and it can get pretty busy... But definitely worth the wait!,1
4,"Dishoom is a very pleasant, casual restaurant serving an interpretation of Indian street food.  The food is of a high quality, the portions generous and the prices fair.  Unlike other places that serve ""tapas portions"" you actually can get full at Dishoom.  
I greatly enjoyed the chicken roll with mint sauce and the lamb chops.  I've also had the breakfast here and enjoyed the breakfast rolls.
A top-notch place that is also a lot of fun.",1
3,"Dinner at Dishoom on a Thursday was an atmosphere. The upstairs bar and dining area was very much hopping, and the basement bar and dining area much the same. Was a bit taken back by the statement of 'an hour wait' by a server without even so much a look at the books. Turns out it was only 20 minutes. Dishoom's sharing concept is a rarity I am afraid, but it is a very welcome rarity. 
As others have said, it is not the finest Indian in Central, the Bollywood-esque decor isn't particularly interesting but fun, and the service is expected but not above par. The dishes were hot, the variety wide, and our hunger satisfied. We shared a couple of grill plates (the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and  Mushroom Paneer), some Lamb Biryani, and the Chili Cheese Toast. I would patronize again.",-1
5,Possibly the best Indian food I have ever eaten. Thanks to my client who recommended it!,1
4,"I have been to Dishoom a couple of times and the quality of the food has been consistently high.  I first visited for brunch, when I was looking for something other than the typical American breakfast items, and the concept of an Irani Cafe in old Bombay did sound intriguing.  
I really like the design and the whole concept of the restaurant, and it does seem that you are teleported back to the hay day of Bombay Cafes.  My friend complained about the noise level but I thought that added to the ambience of the place, being a bustling and busy roadside joint.
Now the food - usually I am a bit skeptical of places that try to be hip and claim to sell authentic traditional food at the same time, but I think Dishoom did a pretty good job.  We have tried almost everything on the menus and all of them were good. Although here are the dishes I will order every time: any of the grills really, they were all well executed but I especially enjoyed the succulent spicy lamb chops; the masala prawns ; the chicken berry biryani; the okra fries; and the mattar paneer for vegetarians.  The naans are also pretty good.  I also like the kulfis and the chais, lovely! Recommend the brunch menus as well - as I said, a nice alternative to the normal brunch fare.  The Covent Garden location is good for bringing visitors, a lot of them request Indian food and Dishoom is a good option.  Service is also very efficient for such a busy place.  I just love the energy and noise of the place!",1
5,Came to London for a business trip and I had to have Indian food.  I don't eat Indian food often but the dishes were delicious and I loved the chicken curry.  Glad I stopped by you won't regret it.,1
4,"Dinner at Dishoom might have been my favorite meal during my visit to London.  Not the finest food, nor the most striking ambiance, and not even exceptional service... but a flawless balance of the above that set it apart from all the rest.
Although it was a bit of a slow start (is 1800 hours early for dinner in the UK?), servers seemed to be a challenge to flag down.  Once we snagged one, however, cocktails and dishes came fast and furious with a rapid pace that kept up with my appetite.
Each dish after another was more and more delicious.  Particular favorites for me were the lamb biryani with raita, the chicken curry, and the garlic naan that I couldn't get enough of.  I can't quite put my finger on how British Indian food differs from Indian food in India - higher quality ingredients or a different spice combination, perhaps.  Whatever it is, it works superbly.
Without a doubt, I'd come back again.  At roughly £20 a head, I wouldn't consider this a cheap meal, but considering it included a drink and walking out feeling stuffed to the gills, I call it a right fair value.",1
5,Surpassed our expectations. Turned u husband into an Indian food lover. Server was enthusiastic and helped explain the menu. Everything was delicious.,1
3,"Hmmm... well there were certainly loads of pros to Dishoom, mainly the delicious, spicy, fresh, and utterly fantastic food. But outside of the steaming hot plates of goodness that came quickly and seemingly endlessly, I wasn't overly impressed. 
Sure, with a sterile atmosphere like this you have the benefit of not reeking of curry when you leave. Your eyes won't burn, you won't be pushed around by storm trooper servers, and you won't feel rushed out of your seat by the next group of people who have been standing over you drooling for over an hour... (You *know* who I'm talking about.) Consequently though, you'll feel like you're eating Indian food in veritable Cheesecake Factory atmosphere. The whole urban industrial feel just didn't correspond with the cuisine.
The service also seemed a bit off. Our group of 12 was split over two four-person booths, as apparently they don't take bookings. (In fact, we were probably lucky to get a table for all of us, full stop.) Our table never received water though we asked multiple times. A few lassies went missing. Though we ordered two of everything, the orders seemed to be confused over the two tables. 
I can't fault the delicious food -- it really was stunning. But the rest of the experience didn't dishoooooom me away.",-1
4,"In Manchester we often forget there are other cities in the country capable of producing excellent Indian food. We swan around like we're Lord of the Manor, thinking our curries of the mile are as authentic and mindblowing as pizza in New York, burritos in San Francisco, Scouse in Liverpool.
Hey. Scouse is important. It's a culinary behemoth!
Anyway, sometimes we really need taking down a peg or two, and Dishoom really knocked me into shape. First of all, it was different. All clean, shiny surfaces; metallic minimalism... you couldn't call it traditional if you tried, certainly a far cry from the linen tablecloths and chintzy decor I'm used to in Rusholme. Then, the dishes, and I have to tell you - this is the way to eat Indian food. Forget getting your own specific dish, you want a multitude of plates in the middle of the table and you want to mix and match. Tapas-style sharing is what I like best when it comes to dining, and this was perfect.
It's not for the faint of tastebud, as some of the dishes pack a punch - the samosas are spicy, the utterly scrumptious fish fingers are tingly, but there's plenty of raita to cool things down and if that's not enough, soothe your senses with a lassi... rum optional, wink. The paneer salad is all kinds of lush and Lizzie is so right about that Pau Bhaji, very simple but effective? Mightily so. I was one of her very happy campers that evening and I can attest to the fact that we heartily ploughed our way through this divine dish.
They even do breakfasts with an Indian twist, with lots of delicious spiced pastries, and I'd walk back to London if it meant sampling that delicious-sounding chai hot chocolate. This is definitely a place to take somebody to impress, and I'll certainly be recommending it to my London friends. I'll also be warning them that they don't take reservations, so my tip is to get there nice and early!",1
5,Great design and perfect for lunch. Was lucky to arrive just in time before the crowds started to flood in. When leaving there was a queue and this is a large restaurant on two levels. Bear in mind if going downstairs you won't get mobile signal. Now back to the food and service. Service was good but I found it strange that they don't sell coke or Pepsi. Now they sell the Indian brands such and Thumbs up and Limca and also normal lemonade so why miss out the other. Very odd. Also they serve some great chutneys but nothing to go with them at the start which is also stranger as what are you supposed to do with them till your food arrives. But end of the day it's all about the food which was excellent and I will be going again. It's not spicy but extremely tasty. Took a little time to get out of the kitchen but not too bad. The portions are average but the grills are what you would expect as a starter portion  not a main course but I still think good value. Highly recommend this place. But might be worth booking prior to avoid waiting in a queue.,1
4,"I'm not sure what to say.......
Ok so first off i must offer my sincerest apologies to all the Indian restaurants in Glasgow....'I'm sorry darling, i have strayed.....I have slipped off my wedding ring and fallen into the tasty, tasty, naan bread bed of another....'....yeah.
So, Dishoon ya bam! Apart from sounding like a village on the east coast of Scotland (try saying it in your very best Sean Connery accent....see!!), Dishoon is a rather upmarket, trendified Indian serving tapas style dishes of amazing quality and fantastic taste.
A number of us piled in here for some grub after an arduous day of arse-sitting-on and brain filling-upped-ness....very tiring don't you know! To be treated to some rather fookin tasty grub, ranging from old favorites to some pretty unique dishes (all amazing). Being a large group we were spread out over two booths, a bit of a tight fit but good for group bonding.....
Dishes were brought at a steady pace, drinks were kept a flowing and service in general was prompt, polite and well...good. Price?? Well, ok its maybe a bit on the high end, but given the area and the quality of the food, then its little wonder its a tad n the high end.
Verdict then? Great grub, great service and a great way to have a culinary affair on the city you love.....Look out for Jeremy Kyle: He cheated on me with anther city...Glasgow spills Chris's sordid culinary secrets...booo, hiss!!!!",1
4,"Fantastic food!!!! The wait was long but we managed to score an outdoor table within minutes, as there was no wait for the outdoor seating. The mango lassi here is very authentic (unlike the bright artificial orange-colored ones that you usually find in Indian restaurants), and they use whole roasted fennel rather than the powder, so the flavor is really enhanced. Everything we had here was wonderful except the Roti, which was very dry and didn't add to the meal. Perhaps if we had ordered it with curry it would have tasted better. We ended the meal with chocolate chai, and were very happy campers indeed! The decor also is very cute and apparently inspired by Parsi-owned cafes in Mumbai. Service was top notch with incredibly friendly and informative waiters! Will definitely be back soon!",1
5,This place was the best Indian food we had in London. Don't miss this experience. Go early because there is always a line at dinner.,1
4,"Food is delicious. Hard to beat numerous Indian restaurants in the area. Liked my paneer curry and black daal, but it wasn't anything special. Naan was amazing. The line was long and I wouldn't wait in it again.",1
4,"Flavorful, very flavorful. And even more filling. Very good chai. Tender and tasty chicken tikka masala. Nan was pretty good, too.",1
3,"High ceilinged space with capacity for 50+ people in downstairs room made this a great setting for a company gathering.  
We ate a fixed menu with lamb samosas, chili cheese toast, naan, chicken briyani, vegatable curry, chicken tikka and desserts (kulfi on a stick and gola ice).
I have a nut allergy and even though my company hadn't asked about dietary restrictions they helpfully provided a menu which marked which items had nuts (unfortunately this included 2 of the items on our set menu - briyani and veggie curry).  Not to worry, they brought me out an extra main course just for me - and I chose the lamb boti kebab - which was superb!
Spices are used very well to flavor the food - which did not rely of heavy sauces or too much salt to be tasty.  One of the better Indian meals I have ever had that wasn't homecooked.
Note:  If you are not for spice - this is not for you.  Lots of yoghurt and lassi was needed by the non-chili-lovers at our tables.  But, if you are for spice - this is amazing!
Finally, the mango kulfi was amazing.",-1
5,"I hate to make the line any longer, but this is the best Indian food I've ever had. That said, come for lunch. The wait at dinner time was 45 min to get inside, and then 45 min for a table.",1
5,"Best Indian restaurant in London. Me and my friends went here for an evening meal and had a thoroughly enjoyable time - friendly staff, quick service, and delicious food.  Can't ask for anything more from a Indian restaurant!",1
3,"I'm hovering around 3.5 here. Ultimately, the food was good, ""A-OK"" as the 3 star rating states.  I lived in an Indian neighborhood in Chicago so I've had a ton of really great Indian food -- the meal at Dishoom was good, but nothing I hadn't really tasted before. The flavors and spices were great and the chutneys were especially tasty. I do admire the tikka masala wrap I got that was a great lunch option.  The selection of lassis was also nice. Service was good, attentive and friendly, but I can't understand all the hype around the restaurant. The line during the evening was out the door and down the block.  If this is the case when you walk by, keep walking, it's not worth the wait.",-1
4,"Great curry in Central!
I liked this place, it has a funky vibe to it, full of mostly Young Urban Professionals... The staff are very attentive and cool. 
The food ive go as far as saying it is one of the best indian food joints in Central London, fresh, tasteful and all the spice seemed to be balanced incredibly well.
Looking forward to returning soon.",1
4,"Delicious and unpretentious Indian food in a modern and energetic setting with a great vibe. Really enjoyed it. One star off for awkward and inconsistent service, including multiple servers not knowing what the other servers were doing.",1
4,"I take back everything I ever said about London having no food scene. I didn't know what I was talking about, clearly influenced by things I *might* have read in inaccurate magazines. Besides, people (me) who haven't been there in ten years have no business making assumptions. This trip changed my perception of London completely (from meh to love), and food was part of that. All thanks to Dishoom.
My business partners wanted to take me someplace a little more authentic, off the Mayfair scene and into another neighborhood. I was so game. If nothing else, it returned the Mission/SoMa favor when they were in town a few months ago.
I knew Dishoom and I were going to get along splendidly upon walking in and seeing one of the most beautiful clocks ever taking a iconic spot in the decor. Right above the kitchen, it's striking, and I want it. If my SF loft ever materializes, the Dishoom clock is going to be a featured part of the decor.
Which means I'll have to go back to get it, which would be no problem at all. The four of us split some outstanding dishes:
- Grilled chicken that became part of delicious roti rolls that rivaled my favorites at Kasa (
yelp.com/biz/kasa-indian…
)
- Stunningly good lobster straight out of the shell 
- Black daal that complemented the above perfectly
- Fresh mangoes with vanilla yogurt. Can't. Ever. Get. Enough.
Everything was washed down with a DG&T (gin, tonic and a few drops of Indian ginseng). Score.
Only the veggie biryani underwhelmed. It could have used more veggies, less rice.
From clocks to eats to drinks, it was a wonderful dinner out. My bad London, my bad. This SF foodie has never so loved being wrong.",1
4,"Delicious and interesting Indian food, was definitely impressed.  They had a lot of unique dishes and not a lot of your typical curries.  Service was very good.  I liked the modern and classy interior, especially after eating at a really dingy pub for lunch.  My only gripes were that the portion sizes were a bit small, and it was oddly hot and stuffy inside the restaurant.  Definitely a classy place though, and would be worth a second visit!",1
5,This place made me love Indian food. Fantastic drinks- we had chili martinis which were creative and very tasty. We ordered based on waiter recommendations and loved everything especially the grilled fish.,1
4,"I'm not a fan of Indian food, I mean, I like it but I wouldn't eat it on a regular basis. I really wanted to try Dishoom, though, mainly because of very good reviews I'd read and finally went there for lunch on Sunday. I loved the place, specially the decoration and furniture downstairs and the bathrooms. It's clear that a lot of attention has been taken regarding the decoration, I truly liked that.
 The food was very good as well. We (my boyfriend and I) weren't very hungry so we only shared three small/medium dishes: Roomali Dishoom Chicken Roll (tasty but way too spicy for me, my boyfriend ate it whole), Keema Pau (spiced minced lamb, delicious) and Dishoom calamari. The calamari were fantastic, a bit sweet, with chilli and lime, so good.
 I would go back to this place, specially if I had friends visiting me in London or something like that. I think it's a great place to go with a medium/large group, it feels lively, fun and very relaxed.",1
5,"Yummers all around, but be prepared to shell out the pounds. Wonderful creative food, exquisite service, but totally unpretentious. For starters, the Caesar salad is a must and the Beef Tartar unique (do I detect liver? Foie Gras?). The night we went, the oyster selection was Irish and both kinds were just sooooo good; I could eat dozens of these, but tonight was not an oyster night.
For mains we had the Staffordshire beef fillet, Iberian pork and Tandoori Monkfish. See picture - each perfectly cooked.
Had such a fun waiter, and all the staff were spunky and gracious. Just had a very good time; getting a resy here isn't the easiest, but worth it!",1
5,"Chiltern. 
Chiltern. 
Chiltern. 
From the crab donuts
To the perfectly crispy and slippery octopus tentacles 
To the McDonalds-esque french fries
Burning up the house with the beautiful burrata 
Sliding into the perfectly prepared pork DM's 
Peaking with the chocolate sourdough mixture from heaven
Chiltern is our #1
Chiltern is the winner
Chiltern over everything
Kiki truly loves Chiltern 
YEET
Thank you & we will absolutely be coming again

5,"Lives up to the elegant hype because I traveled from San Francisco, California and stayed at the hotel for several days in April 2018, enjoying the tasty, well-prepared food immensely and received 5-star service at all times. Chiltern Firehouse is one of a kind due to hands-on management.
***Continue for personal highlights.***
Dizzy from jet lag and unpacking in my cute room on the 3rd floor the enthusiastic & elegant staff accommodated my late lunch holding a corner table alas, unsuitable for people watching. They prepared a new table for me and their suave staff's baroque politeness was beautifully theatrical as I absorbed the London vibe, fantastic.
First meal was fish, some veggies a salad? Was jet lagged as hell & siped champagne for restorative purposes (hee hee) when I spied the super duper famous  ____, cheers.  I'd say more about that but what happens at the Chiltren Firehouse stays there. 
Being a girl who lives near Twitter's headquarters I appreciate their no selfies standard, bravo. You're not in American there, hooray.
During my stay at the hotel, a London native pal and I ate at the bar &  shared a bottle of bubbly, fries, those delectable crab donuts the fried chicken thingies their bar food is an American dream:  Euro-size portions at posh-American prices, wink, cool, I kept my figure didn't gain any weight on vacation. Seriously.
 I ordered room service several times and it was better than most San Francisco restaurants. Worth every considerable penny paid. Their green juice and French press coffee is amazing.
My well-appointed room with the automatic authentic fireplace and an old-school rotary phone was very quiet one of the best I've stayed in.
Chiltern Firehouse is a Benetton ad come to life with pretty smiling happy elegant as hell employees, do they breed them? Am I rambling? Yes, as I flew 10,000 miles round trip to stay & eat there especially as a warm up to see the Tina Turner musical (swoon) and meet Ruby Wax  (humblebrag but damn, Tina Turner and an Andre Balazs joint?).
5 Stars. Money very well spent for this American chick!",1
4,"Definitely make a reservation before coming, visited the restaurant on a Wednesday afternoon and the restaurant was packed! The food was good (loved the presentation especially), but not amazing - many dishes had potential but I find them quite bland. I tried the much hyped crab doughnuts and was disappointed, couldn't taste the crab at all! I recommend the trout ceviche, steak salad and raspberry pavlova, these were my favorites out of all the other dishes.",1
5,"Chiltern Firehouse is one of my favorite places in London. It's not exaggerating to say that I just want to fly back for Chiltern Firehouse. The restaurant or hotel renovated out of a firehouse has very cozy atmosphere but also imbues luxurious feelings that make me feel special to be around. 
I have visited for the dinner once and the breakfast; both were pleasant experiences.
You won't be disappointed with this spot.",1
4,"Very beautiful place. Nice building (amazing architecture), beautiful terrasse and a lovely bar. 
They say many artists/celebrities hang out here. We can easily tell why.
Staff was very nice and smiley but so slow! We waited 20 minutes and nobody came to see us, we had to ask for the menus at the bar. Then, another 15 minutes to get our drinks. We were not sitting at the bar but beside the fireplace. 
Many people go there to see and be seen. 
Quite pricey but you expect it here. 
18£ for a cocktail",1
4,"One of the best resturants I ate at while visiting London.  Cute, clean, great service and everything I had was delicious! If you live in London or are just visiting I highly recommend you try this restaurant. Make sure you make a reservation in advance!",1
4,"When dining at Chiltern Firehouse, make reservations in advance and tell them you'd like to sit by the chef's counter. It's quite the experience - watching the cooks prepare the food together like a well-oiled machine. From here, you get to witness everything from the meat grilling to the meticulous plating. I must also say that service here is on point. Anyone who has dined with me knows that I drink water like a race horse. Flagging down waiters for refills are thus usually a problem, but not at Chiltern.
// Crab Stuffed Donuts (£7) - 4 stars
One of Nuno Mendes' signature creations, this unique snack is what the restaurant is best known for. These slider-sized donuts are filled with crab and topped with coral dusting. A great balance of sweet and savory to start the meal off.
// Firehouse Caesar (£12) - 3 stars
What separates this dish out from all the other Caesar salads is the crispy chicken skin they include. Flavor-wise, I didn't think it was anything special though.
// Spiced Cornish Crab & Lobster Omelette (£26) - 4 stars
This is not your typical scrambled omelette. As seen in the picture, the ingredients actually sit on top of the eggs rather than being mixed in. The coral mayo helped pull all the components together, with the shiso leaves adding in a nice touch.
// Frozen Apple Panna Cotta (£9) - 5 stars
I debated for the longest time whether or not to order this dessert, but I'm sure glad I went for it. Such a beautifully plated finale. I especially enjoyed the herb granite, which was spectacular both visually and in taste.",1
4,"A good experience! I went there on a Sunday with friends for a brunch. It was crowded, I think because it was a Sunday. Even when we were on time, we were told to wait at the bar for the table. I ordered a Bloody Mary which was really good. I haven't had such a tasty Blood Mary in ages. Almost more than 30 minutes, when we asked whether the table was ready, we were told that it was ready but the waitress couldn't find us. Weird! 
We ordered few starters and oysters. The starters came on time and then we were served the mains. The Cornish crab omelette is a must try! When my friend enquired about the Oyesters, the waitress said that she had totally forgotten to serve it. So she will bring it after the mains. Again weird!
The chef himself brought the Oyesters to the table and explained us about the Oyesters, which was very kind of him. They were pretty good.
Overall a good experience with food. The service is not efficient.",1
5,"The ambiance was nice with long-wicked candles on the tables & dim lighting. Our party of 5 had a reservation but still had to wait at the bar for a little before being seated, which was fine since it gave us an opportunity to talk to the bartender & decide on drinks. The drinks were very fresh & I was happy with my choice. Our waiter was funny and informative of the dishes & we enjoyed very fresh oysters to start. The plates are small but tasty.",1
5,"Wonderful venue for meeting friends, taking in a late breakfast, and enjoying your favorite drink(s). Great staff. Great food. Great drinks. Spectacular.",1
5,"We had a lovely last evening in London at the Chiltern Firehouse. The menu was imaginative - we enjoyed the burrata, gnocchi and lamb dishes. The atmosphere is upscale, but relaxed and the wait staff was friendly and accommodating. It wasn't a surprise that on a Monday night, every table was full. Yoghurt and sourdough ice creams were a treat! We will definitely be back on our next trip.",1
2,"2 stars for ambience.
0 stars for food.
Crab stuffed donuts l, first were NOT donuts more like hard bun.  Crab nonexistent ~ lots of egg to cover fact no crab!! Way too much mayonnaise.  Do not order these.
Tempura Aubergine was tasteless served cold, and sauce was ""supposed"" to be miso.  Did not taste a drop of miso.  Very bland sauce.
Chargrilled Padron Peppers, were NOT chargrilled, hot, tasty.  No salt, a whispering of ricotta salata did not give any additional flavor.  They needed Maldon salt, but cold and watery they were.  Very disappointed in food.
Burger quality was poor, overcooked tough meat. Fries were warm, but tasted perhaps frozen from restaurant supply??? 
Just mediocre foods  at best.
Then to make matters worse a bearded bartender was extremely rude to me when i was taking a photo of bar, which was empty!! He said ""you can not take photos!  Such a stern rude voice, and i did not understand, so he repeated quite rudely again.  So he then says hotel policy, i relied i understand.  But why was i treated like this.  How was i to know?  No signs, no clue... so perhaps the next time he interacts with guests like this perhaps a softer voice, a nicer approach and not such a horrible glare.  I almost left.   In a way i should of considering the food and rude bartender.  Waitress was adorable sweet, soft and kind mannerism.",-1
1,Do not support this business in any way. Terrible customer service and hospitality.  They must hate Americans in general. Extremely disappointed in my visit here. After a very large and generous 6 person meal...we went to meet friends in their bar. The bar was very empty and they did not allow us to stay nor have a conversation with our friends there for more than 60 seconds before they escorted us out to a back alley and treated us like trash.  Employees need to be re-evaluated and have an extreme superiority complex.  Boycott at all costs.,-1
4,"Lovely & upscale restaurant. Suitable for special occasions - lunch, brunch and dinner avsilable. It is a pretty fancy place to dine and there is a dress code - No trainers or flip flops! Casual smart is fine. People who show up there can be quite dressy. If you are lucky,  you might run into a celebrity :) Unfortunately I've never had the chance to bump into any local movie stars during my visits. Bummer!!
I had dinner on my first visit and it was on weekday with a group of 3pax. It was hard to get a booking, and you might want to do this in advance especially if it's near a festive season. We tried to increase our group size to 4pax at the very last minute over the phone but were politely rejected. So don't just show up with a +1 at the door, you might not even get your table. 
Upon arrival they ushered me to the table and took my coats and jackets. Immediately sat me down and made me comfy. Then proceeded to recommend me a cocktail which would pair well with our food. I enjoyed my first experience so much that I decided to make a second comeback with my partner for a Christmas brunch over the weekend. It took me about a good month in advance to book a slot, dinner slots were completely wiped out till 2017. 
I must say I was a little disappointed with their service the second time around. I did not receive the same hospitality as I did for dinner. The staff seem a little flustered that day, nothing was really offered nor recommended to us. It felt like that they were a little short handed. What a shame though, I was hoping to give my partner the same level of experience I had the first time but it wasn't up to that level. Nevertheless the food and drinks were still amazing. However it would be great if they maintain consistency with their services.",1
5,"I was SO EXCITED to eat here, I've been wanting to come for a while but never had the time. This place 100% met my expectations. 
The entrance is very confusing but normally they have workers to lead you to the restaurant from the entrance. The venue is also a hotel, so there are many hallways to walk down. The restaurant is bright and open and has a distinctive smoky smell. 
I was extremely excited to try their pancakes. THEY WERE DELICIOUS!!!! The pancakes are thick and fluffy and taste like thick American pancakes. The blueberries, blueberry compote, syrup, and yogurt topping all come on the side so you can add what you would like to. I highly recommend getting the pancakes. 
The pastries are also lovely. My mother got the croissants and loved them, but they are very large so next time, it might be better to get the selection of miniature pastries instead. 
The orders of toast are rather small so one order is only enough for one person, but it is sourdough toast and is amazing!
They also have several delicious juices. The fresh pressed apple juice was amazing.  Additionally, they have drip coffee that is pretty good.",1
5,"Fun, posh vibe!
I made a reservation for my birthday brunch here & i'm so glad i did!  What a fun experience.
I called about a month in advance and had no issues getting a reservation for the day & time i wanted. I know this place is notoriously difficult to get into but maybe that is just for dinner?  I was apprehensive about it but ended up having no issues.
We ordered several items - ricotta blueberry pancakes, cornbread, chili crab noodles,  crab beignets & cesar salad.
The chili crab noodles were to die for! I'm so sad i didn't ask more questions about them so i could try to recreate them at home.
The cesar salad was also quite memorable. 
Overall, all the food was great and a fun place to celebrate a special occasion or a night out.
Will definitely be back on my next trip to London!",1
5,"nice place nice food good stuff , good portions , cosy warm atmosphere highly recommended for breakfast",1
5,"I loved this place. My husband and I had dinner here on a sunny Wednesday night, and it was super buzzy and fun. I had made a reservation via email over a month in advance, and they could only accommodate us at 6pm or 10pm (gah), or at 8pm at chef's counter. I love counter seating, so this worked out perfectly.
The decor was impeccably chic as expected, based on other Andre Balazs joints (Chateau Marmont, The Mercer). The food and service, however, were world class as well. The ever-changing menu really focused on seasonal ingredients, so we took advantage of that.
We started with the asparagus, which was appropriately light despite the mountain of egg yolk shavings that adorned it. For a main, I went with the gnocchi, which was accompanied by a flawless presentation of taleggio, raisins, spring peas, and rounds of fennel. It was spring on a plate, and I am still thinking about it 2 weeks later.",1
4,"An old fire station, chiltern is trendy and cute. We went for drinks with friends around 6:30 pm. There were 7 of us and we sat in the corner by the record player.
Drinks are good with plenty of options for cocktails, beer, and wine. There is a bar menu for food, which includes cheese plate, charcuterie, burger, etc.
Great place for drinks!",1
4,This is a bustling restaurant in an old firehouse. It is lovely and vibrant.  I had the pain AI chocolat and it wonderfully flaky with high quality chocolate within. My companions had the pancakes with syrup and berries and greatly enjoyed them as well.,1
3,"I was really disappointed by this place but the food was really tasty so Im putting a 3. 
The service was hazy not to the standard you would expect from such a place!
However the food was really tasty and original.
We had the seared steak salad, the pancakes, the crab doughnuts (loved those), Syrian tartare (very original with the yoghurt and pistaccio), the foie gras and the smoked mackerel.
The Spritz cocktails although not appealing looking were super good!",-1
3,"This was probably the most disappointing (and expensive) meal of our trip. While service and the atmosphere were great, the food was just so-so. They were out of the burrata appetizer, which was a bummer. The grilled octopus was just ok as was the mushroom/egg appetizer. My chicken was weird tasting and my husbands lamb was Ok. Everything was super small. I did enjoy the tarte tatin for dessert. I wouldn't come back.",-1
1,"First trip to London and on a whim me and 3 friends came to dinner here for my birthday. Everything started off amazing. Food was great, service was spot on and atmosphere was really fun. Met some cool people sitting next to us and decided to get the check and go to the bar in the hotel attached,also apart of chiltern firehouse. This is where the whole night took a wild turn. 
After we got in ,the hostess, Amy Cuff, came up and notified us we would only be allowed one drink and would need to leave immediately after because the bar was ""private"" and since the hotel was packed they ""needed the room"" for hotel guests. Which we were with. 
Just FYI. The bar was empty....
We tried to order another dink from the EMPTY bar and the bartender said very apologetically the hostess notified him we were allowed one drink and then require to leave. 
Birthday ruined. Never coming back. Ladder Shed London. You failed.",-1
4,"A solid four. This place has a nice vibe and the food is Delish. Loved the specials, the crab donuts were tasty but simple won tonight - great quality fresh natural oysters. Yummo. 
I can't help but feel like I'll always unfairly compare chiltern to viajante... viajante is hands down the winner but still very good.",1
3,"Outstanding cocktails & food, cool space but loud atmosphere (place to be seen and apparently also heard). Three stars due to horrifically snooty incompetent hostesses (yes, plural).. The outdoor area was fairly empty but hostesses insisted on seating us in a walkway. We finally ended up with a decent table thanks to our server and persistence from my husband.  Service was good but slow. Started with super stiff excellent drinks -- gin & tonic and old fashioned. Had to have second each despite generous pour. Then shared spiced watermelon, steak tartare & Iberian bbq pork. Could have order seconds on all but instead tried four desserts, all fab. Would we come again?  Not sure unless with a regular to get decent table. We had reserved but clearly counts for nought.",-1
3,"My friend and I went the other night 
I doubt we will be returning
Here is the experience beginning to end
Chiltern fireplace has always had a buzz about it attracted a nice crowd  and good food and drinks
I looked up the restaurants website on google hit call a posh sounding woman answered , I communicated that I wanted to book and she asked me to hold for a minute. 12 minutes later she said she could offer me a table at 8:30 in response to an 8 pm request  I accepted ( this was a month in advance for a Sunday night)
I confirmed the booking the day before by email no probs
On the day my friend was delayed by heavy traffic 
So I called and asked if it would be ok if we were 15 minutes late the woman who answered said ""that should be ok I will note the booking"" I wasn't sure where I stood but just assumed all would be ok.
We arrived 10 minutes late staff were cheery polite and receptive and showed us to a nice table
We both ordered salads a rib eye on bone steak to share a bottle of 2012 tignanello  420 pounds
Cesar salad nicely presented tasty but hard to eat as dish was a bit small ( fell over sides when you tried to eat it) steak was excellent and perfect one of the best I have ever had it was shared but when it came waiter hadn't cleared starter plates and tried to have us eat it on salad plates 
No bread served until requested (over 45 minutes)
I ordered chocolate desert bland too tart tasteless and texture less 
Sommelier was all show and no go  acted  trendy snooty etc but didn't know his game  served wine way to cold 17 degrees c good wine (240£)
Needs to be served at room temperature when challenged he was a bit disrespectful
When we were leaving we attempted to have a drink at the bar we were polite we were refused  I asked for the nice hostess who met us upon arrival and was told that she was doing her evening management report . instead  we were lead down a dark coloured passage to an alleyway  behind the restaurant where a nice burley guy managed to find us a cab after a 10 minute wait while we were waiting another ""uncool ""couple met the same fate
This was the second time this has happened on a quiet Sunday night I can't help but feel like I was trying to gain admission to studio 54 in the 80's
So here is my message to management : be careful this restaurant/hotel has been going for a while and is starting to come off the boil a bit Staff in general are well trained and polite there seems to be an over abundance of peacocky Italian types that are more show than go and a smidge arrogant 420 pounds is a lot for a steak and a bottle of Italian wine not everyone can pay that effortlessly  rather than let a pair of nice well dressed polite older guys have one drink after dinner  to choose to lead them down the basement tunnel of rejection is a bit off putting and demoralising and takes the edge off what would have otherwise been a fun evening
Getting too cool for school ...... maybe management is considering selling the place and is trying to hang on a little bit too long to the exclusive celebrity hype image . I don't know but if I am not good enough to have a drink at the bar I am not going to buy fine wine and posh chow in the restaurant
All the best for the future",-1
4,"Came to Chiltern Firehouse based off common knowledge that this was a London hotspot.  I was dining alone on vacation and informed them to offer me a spot at the bar or whatever they had a available.  I was able to sit at the chefs counter and get a full on show of them cooking everyones food.  I have to say the place inside and out was gorgeous and the service was great.  Yes, it's a bit pricey and that's why I have given 4 stars because I'm not sure if the food equals out to the hefty tag.  The food looks delicious and is prepared in detail but my salmon was a little too firm, as was the roe on it and the crab donuts were good but not spectacular.  I also had a chocolate cake which was delicious.  Overall great experience to check off the London bucket list but not sure I would immediately rush back next time I'm in town.",1
5,"Love the atmosphere, the drinks, and even more, the oysters. Amazing time with friends.",1
4,"Hello handsome! Gorgeous brunch in a garden setting, elegant. Each area of the Firehouse is beautifully done - from the outdoor garden, semi-alfresco tall-ceilinged bar room, to the main dining room. Enjoyed an outstanding smoked salmon eggs benedict while friends loved the fluffy pancakes with fresh blueberries and crème fraîche. There is a bit of celebrity hype around the Firehouse, but regardless, quite a fine establishment.",1
3,"Bland.  Bland, bland, bland.  
I visit family in London once a year.  This year my splurge was to go to Chiltern Firehouse.  It's a beautiful space with excellent staff and excellent wine selection.  The food presentation is exquisite.  And the food is... meh.  
-mini-doughnuts stuffed with crab meat -- the doughnut was tasteless,
-chard octopus had potential, even simply done with lemon it can be fantastic, but this preparation with a little pickled radish and a little chorizo was underwhelming, 
-the salmon was presented beautifully and it was fine but hardly worth a return trip.  
The best part of the meal was excellent brown bread with fantastic creamy, creamy butter.",-1
2,"Went here for lunch on a weekday afternoon and sat outside on the patio. Loved the ambiance of the area. The food was also quite good, if not a little overpriced. I ordered the sea bass, and had a good crab donut starter.
However, the service I have to say was one of the worst I've received at a restaurant. I don't know if it was the way we were dressed (didn't dress too formally, it was lunchtime) or something else, but the waitress was rude and not friendly at all. It's a shame as the environment is so beautiful. If you're going to be paying £30 for a single dish, the service better be up to par! Won't be returning.",-1
5,"The hype was real, its Nuno Mendes at its best with no frills. Despite his Michelin background the ambience is relaxed and there's a open kitchen to see all the busy chefs at work. Staff are a little inattentive at times but all friendly. 
The 'snacks' are a must with its famous crab doughnut, we also had the tuna devilled egg, corn bread with bacon and maple syrup butter. For mains we got a mixture but I went for my favourite octopus with daikon/shitake in soy broth. This was Devine with a twist of Japanese flavours. My friends ordered the iberico pork and duck with caramelised carrots and smoked short ribs all looked amazing! We didn't stop there either and indulged in the desserts from strawberry eaton mess, peach melba and rye with old fashioned syrup and vanilla ice cream. We were absolutely stuffed and the bill came to about £70 per person but it was all so worth it!",1
5,"I can't say enough amazing things about this place. The food was great and creative, the drinks were tasty, the staff were so charming and helpful and checked on us often, including the manager Sam (promote that man. He's a gem) and we felt like superstars! (Even though we're clearly not).  
I was so pleased because I went through a bit to contact and book this place from the states a month before I came just to be sure our group would have a spot.  
I'll post pics if I still have them. If your experience is anything like mine, you won't be disappointed. 
Side note: was kind of hard finding the taxi after we left due to the paparazzi, but the rest of the evening was so amazing who cares!?",1
4,"This place is fun! It's in a super hip neighborhood and the space reflects that, but it still feels warm and inviting. We had a great waitress who didn't make us feel rushed at all throughout our meal, and we had a great time with the menu. It's definitely a place that is ""see and be seen"" so it can come off as a bit showy, which I can understand would make some people feel uncomfortable, but to us, it was all in good fun. It's a great place for people watching!
The three of us ordered the fish dishes, which were divine. We had a really great bottle of wine and the sashimi appetizer as well. The service was great -- our candle blew out halfway through the meal and instead of ignoring it they brought us a brand new one! (It may seem silly, but it's the small things that set service apart for me.) 
I liked this place a lot for a fun trendy night out in London.",1
4,"The place brought  childhood  memories,I used to live at this street  and I used see the fire  brigates  as something big and amaizing. 
And it used to make noise as they get out of the building to save lives.
I never imagen that it will be Ahotel and fancy  restaurant. 
The sarvice   and the staff were amazing, they offer me a nice table after telling  them  I can't site  on the high  chair  of the bar.
The food was excellent  the only thing is its over priced I think !",1
5,"We also had to rely on the AmEx Concierge to get a reservation... though this place has been popular with celebrities for years, it doesn't seem to be waning.  (And we did spot a few older, obscure British tv personalities there.)
Service was great, food was fantastic, and though its not a cheap spot, I thought prices were pretty fair given the quality of the experience. (Just be careful about which wine you order - they have an impressive and expensive list.)
There are several vegetarian options in all sections of the menu.  As others have mentioned, the polenta with truffles was outstanding.  We started with some ""carrot blunts"", which were smokey and delicious and crispy and fun.  My friends had the pork, which they refused to share because it was so good, and others at the table were very happy with the beef.
Though they are serious about making sure you don't linger at the table more than 2 hours, our waitress secured us seats in the bar so we could finish our espresso martinis there. All in all, it was great food with great vibe - it didn't disappoint!",1
5,"This place has a reputation for being the place to see and be seen, but while the environment was ""active"", it seemed overall fine and not overly pretentious.  Really nice European classic environment with a fun bar, great multi-level seating and some unique spaces.  Really nice.  Also seemed to have a front patio that would be a great place to eat (weird that nobody was out there after about 7PM).
We had a private party (in a nice, if snug, dining room at the front of the restaurant) and the food and the service were really amazing.
While we didn't order, per se, we were delighted with an assortment of courses from across the menu...
Bacon Cornbread:  Um, delicious.
Cauliflower Florets:  Seriously savory.  Really great.
Crab-stuffed Donuts:  Not the best...  seemed to struggle to go together.
Fried Chicken:  Seriously amazing.  Really, the best bite we had all night.
We thought we were near done at this point, but way more to come:
Firehouse Caesar:  Yay anchovies!!
Steak Tartare: Mix it up first, then eat.  Great flavors.  So rich.  Wow.
Mullet or Cod Crudo (can't remember which):  Light and flavorful
Gnocchi:  
...and the mains:
Monkfish:  We were getting late in the meal and had a lot of this.  Really amazing.
Lamb (I think it was the lamb...):  Decent, but not amazing.  Obviously forgetful.
I have a huge pet peeve about restaurants serving a very limited set menu for larger parties, so great that these guys gave us a really comprehensive and varied tour around their menu.  Much appreciated.
One critique is that the whole thing could have been salted a bit more.  Other than that, really a perfect meal.  Kudos to this place for not letting food quality slip given the reputation.",1
5,"Over the three and a half months that I was in London, this was easily my favorite dining experience. 
I'm told that the Firehouse is a rather upscale place where the big shots of London society (and occasionally celebrities) come to dine. The interior is beautiful, with an heir of classic French brasserie but with a contemporary London twist. Reservations are a must considering the hefty crowd during peak hours. The service was top notch from start to finish, and our server was very knowledgable on the menu and helped us on deciding what to order. We had the cornbread appetizer as well as a salad to start, both delicious. The short rib entree was wonderful and beautifully cooked. My favorite thing on the menu however was the black truffle polenta, very unique and sinful. Dessert consisted of some sort of cake with an ice cream that was also very good. I thoroughly enjoyed the Firehouse; everything from the food, to the service, to the ambience was just fabulous. Definitely one of the highlights of my trip to London.",1
5,"You absolutely MUST eat here, not just for the food (which is amazing!!) but for the experience. The former firehouse is beautifully decorated. The food and service are top, I have never been for dinner but their brunch is my favourite in London. The pancakes and eggs benedict are a must. Mimosa was mediocre.  Make sure to look out for celebrities!",1
5,"Best breakfast ever - a very delicious French toast, omelette and cappuccino. I love the atmosphere with the firehoses woven into the ceiling and the beautiful bar area. The decor is very tasteful and the place to go if you're visiting London.",1
3,"Space is beautiful and staff is very friendly but kind of a weird experience...pancakes are served ""barely warm"" as opposed to hot, though the flavor is delicious. Had to ask for water when other patrons were offered. Service seemed to be all over the place.",-1
4,"Amazing. Yeah, that good. Gorgeous building, cozy & warm interiors, & warm & professional staff. Nice buzz, but not too noisy. We had an excellent table, thanks to AMEX Concierge.
Food? Uh huh, yeah. Foue gras w/ bacon & fig jam: GTFO. Braised oxtail: Seriously GTFO. Grilled asparagus: dang! And whatever that amazing chocolate concoction pie was: kill me again with chocolate.
Our waiters were amazing, personable, and very professional. Wine list was terrific! 
The reason for only 4 stars? We had to wait for 15 mins for our table at the bar, but there aren't enough bar tables & the area was small. So we kept getting bumped into or (nicely) asked to move a bit, as staff went back & forth. Also, the fries were limp. No excuse.",1
5,"It's sad that i wont get to eat at Viajante ever again. I was told that Nuno Mendes had moved here with a new concept. My last trip through the UK and it's my first meal in town after a long ass flight. My hotel isnt ready so i get on the tube and lo and behold the station i need is closed. Ive got a large backpack and jacket and as i exit the next station to circle back and then walk a few K its getting hot. Of all the times in London for this to happen..
I walk to the streets and finally get there. Im shown to a space that is looking right at the pass. Perfect. Ive been up for 20 hours and can finally settle. It turns out my server is an ex Dinex guy and worked for Daniel and his mix of restos in NYC. Good start. Im watching as they furiously plate and cook, and expedite. This is a furiously busy kitchen. I then meet Sebastian one of the sous chefs and he's talking about his time traveling, cooking and finally ending up at Chiltern. He makes some suggestions and im on my way. For some reason there's a mix up and someone  approaches with a Bloody Mary. Ive been up way too long but im sure i didnt order it. But What the hell i said id take it anyways if it didnt belong to another ticket. I dont generally like them but realized after how excellent the first sip was that ive been drinking sub par ones for who knows how long. Score.
My food starts coming out and a couple of older dodded up ladies sit near me then start complaining about how they want a booth and were disappointed in that thats what they shouldve had. My server takes it graciously and says he'll talk to the reservationists. They are moved soon after. Thank goodness. Dont think i could have dealt with that. I have a chat with my server and he says the place has become somewhat of a hot spot and that people come to be seen and watch. As someone who's here for a Michelin starred chefs cooking, the best seats are at the pass! Soon a gentleman is sat next to me and we agree on the same topic. Turns out he's just as obsessive with food as i am and is a regular here. I recommend the carrot dessert which is unusual, complex and ultimately delicious. We are now food allies.
Aside from the carrot dessert, the beef and veggie hash and the dry aged burger and fries are fantastic, comforting and have their own delicious twist. Service was excellent and as someone who is not famous and was treated very well. I think having a rapport with the kitchen also helped greatly but when it's about the food, that's how you focus. I guess if youre a scene person, just dont act like those ladies...",1
4,"My family of 7 ate here for dinner during our trip to London and enjoyed it a lot. The building itself and the garden are beautiful and quaint while also trendy. We had a perfect private dining room to block out some of the noise. Crab doughnuts and fried chicken snacks were very tasty, and everyone enjoyed their mains as well. Waitstaff was friendly and accommodating.",1
5,"Unknowingly, i came to one of London's hottest restaurants. I could see why everyone really likes it. I did too! The staff is very nice, the atmosphere is very cool and intimate at the same time and the cocktails and food are great. 
Definitely try the gnocchi! I think, no i know, it was my favorite thing on the menu out of everything we tried.",1
5,"So much attention to detail from start to finish. Perfect portions. Sea bass, roasted chicken and chocolate tart. Enjoy. Try the chefs counter and watch your meal prepared.",1
5,Went here for my birthday and had a marvelous time. The atmosphere was so fun and the service is absolutely top notch.  We started with the bacon cornbread and the crab doughnuts.  Both shouldn't be missed!  The rest of the dinner was fresh and flavorful.  Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a special night on the town! Can't wait to go back!,1
3,Booked a few weeks in advance to secure a table for weekend brunch. The decor inside is lovely but finding the actual restaurant once you've entered the premise is a bit of a maze. It could do with some signposting or a person guiding patrons through. Though we had a reservation at 2:00- we were told to wait for 25 mins.  When we were sat I promptly ordered the peach mint champagne spritzer. It didn't end up arriving until after the food which was crazy- also served in a highball glass which I felt the presentation could have been better. The food was flavoursome but portions are small for the price. I ordered the eggs florentine and my friend ordered the eggs Benedict. The eggs florentine was flavoursome but I can't attest to saying it was anything out of the ordinary. My friend and I shared a stack of the pancakes which we both enjoyed and we were glad we ordered as did not feel full from our egg dishes. Service was consistent and decor inside is lovely however I wouldn't rush to come back here- expensive and nothing out of the ordinary.,-1
5,"Probably the best pancakes I've had in my life, and I don't say that lightly. Will say the service wasn't the friendliest, but it was overall a really cute place for weekend brunch!! Would definitely go back!!!",1
5,"Sooo expensive.  Not family friendly unless your children are extremely well behaved and keep a controlled volume.  
However, this place is amazing!  The decor is wonderful, a little odd but who cares when the food is fantastic.  It is extremely upscale and has a dress code.  Chiltern's food was incredible.  Small servings for the price but that's what you get at such a fancy, expensive, 5-star restaurant.  
Americans- please keep in mind that all restaurants in Europe are very different than what you are accustomed to.  Service is great but slow because meals, especially dinner, take much longer in Europe.  Relax and enjoy!",1
5,"Booking: Either the mass panic bookings of 2014 have passed, or I was one of the lucky ones that didn't seem to have a problem getting a table for Dinner at Chiltern Firehouse. Was offered a place at the Chef's Counter on the phone, which I took (and recommend you ask for!). 
Arrival: Staff were friendly and courteous, and we grabbed some champagne at the bar while our table was being readied. Apart from quite a few Russian oligarchs, the bar was wells stocked with 12, 18 and 25year Japanese whiskeys, and some decent champagne options.
Searing: We were originally sat at a normal table, but pushed correctly to be placed as booked at Chef Counter. CC is a little less formal, and requires sitting on a high stool with less leg room; so if you have a long leggy date (in a dress or otherwise) you may want to save it for next time. That said, it's the best table at the Firehouse; watching the speed and precision of the appetiser area, with the giant meat grill & smoking each behind, was a great conversation piece. The chef's ears perked up while we were chatting about what he was doing, and gave us a taste while explaining everything. The man was insanely busy, so that small gesture was truly special.
Food: 
+ Crab Donuts have a well earned reputation as a 'must have'. Only three of them but delicious.
+ Streak Tartare: a late summer sun sat on the tartare, that you beat into each other to give a very rich dish. The Firehouse hot sauce, a smoked spicy apple flavour, was insanely delicious. I would literally buy bottles of it alone. 
+ Calamari: now off the summer menu, it was still delicious, fresh and not even remotely rubbery.
+ Main: credit to the waiter, he recommended we share the day's special of 300g Wagu beef with a wasabi-yogurt sauce and rocket salad (possibly as it was also £78). We paired it up with the Maple-Bourbon Sweet Potatoes (which is a mash, not fries). All I can say is the beef was succulent and tender, perfectly medium-rare; but the sweet potatoes mash- my god. Nearly too sweet, but I was licking (secretly) the copper bowl it arrived it (which is straight from the hot plate, so watch out). More. I wanted more. 
+/- Dessert: Key lime pie was lovely. The hint of bitterness was exactly what was needed after the rich meal. My companion had re fudge cake; a classic, but didn't blow me away. Tastes differ I guess! 
+ Wine: Glass of Pecorino, my choice and the waiter's favourite (being Italian). 
+ Service: solid and attentive. Waiter recognised me from somewhere else and told me at then end of the night, which was nice, and didn't mind having a conversation that didn't make you feel he was being nice for the sake of tips. 
- Other: exit later in the evening is out the side entrance by the hotel, though a franky dull corridor near the hotel area, into the side street. Just... Why? Makes you feel you are being turfed out into the gutter. 
Secret suggestion: find the smoking area past the toilets with the lipstick all over it. Meet some celebs. There are other bits, but unless you are a master class blagger or engine celeb, g'luck :)",1
5,"Love love love Chiltern Firehouse. One of the best meals I have in London. The snacks are uber yummy. Get the bacon cornbread, crab meat donuts and fried chicken. For main, the lamb, Iberico pork and short ribs are excellent. End the meal with chocolate ganache. Definitely coming back here when I'm back in town. Call ahead for reservations.",1
5,"Best pancakes I have ever ate, hands down! I'm from Los Angeles and I love pancakes so I know pancakes :), and these were just perfect! I got a side of berries and it was the best breakfast a girl can ask for.",1
5,"It's a bit posh, but quite lovely actually. Famous with the famous, the Chiltern Firehouse is easier to get into by day and so Sunday brunch is a good option for those limited by either timeframe or budget, and those looking for a nice place to catch up what friends. Choose from either the indoor dining room or the flower-filled outdoor courtyard. Try the Bloody Mary and crab omlettes, eggs Benedict or steak tartare with homemade hot sauce. The service and is mildly intimidating and impeccable - but, hey, that's why you wanted to come.....",1
4,"After reading about this as the ""must-see"" restaurant of the moment, I knew it had to be my one big night out of fine dining.  I was happy to get the reservation that I wanted, and pulling up to the restaurant in our taxi, it definitely felt like I had arrived at someplace special.  
The building is awesome, and the decor of the restaurant is fabulous.  We were shown to a great table, and everyone at the host stand seemed nice but a bit aloof -- to be expected, I guess.  However, our wait staff was amazing -- friendly, knowledgeable, and fun!  The food was terrific, though nothing I probably couldn't have had elsewhere, including San Francisco where I live.  The reason to come here is a combo of the food, the service, and the vibe and energy of the restaurant.  Make it a destination on your next London visit!",1
4,"We went here for a brunch. Had the pancakes which come with jams and butter, nice and the right sweetness!! And the french toasts - good although not outstanding according to my husband. Nice decor and personnel is very friendly. On balance is a good spot for a week-end brunch. Reservation is highly recommended to avoid long lines. We will come back to try more dishes!",1
4,"Nice restaurant. 
The decoration is very nice. 
The service is very fast and incredible. 
The food is more English than international.",1
3,"I confess that even though I read mixed reviews of Chiltern Firehouse and didn't really have high expectations of the food, I still wanted to go in the hope of meeting Kylie (Minogue) there.  Alas it was not to be and I left sans Kylie as a new bff (her loss obvs).
Firstly, the staff they hire are all gorgeous and friendly.  Our waiter had the most beautifully perfect set of teeth combined with a great French accent that we all couldn't help but gaze into his lovely smile.  And our Sommelier was just charming.  The wine she helped us choose was a perfect match to our food.
The food was a little disappointing.  I ordered the crab donuts, steak tartare, and Grilled Iberico Pork for mains.  Crab donuts were okay but surprisingly not very much crab.  Steak tartare was definitely the highlight as this was served with a deliciously spicy smoked sauce that made the raw beef sing.  Iberico pork was very disappointing.  While the pork itself was perfectly tender and tasty, the accompaniments were a green, sour, slushy mess and did nothing to enhance or compliment the pork.
For the price we paid, I wouldn't rush back in a hurry.",-1
3,"Made a reservation about a month in advance with no problem.  Was looking forward to a great meal with family.  The decor is definitely interesting as it still houses the vestiges of its prior firehouse incarnation.  There was a young and hip vibe with the clientele and we looked forward to a relaxing dinner.   The waitstaff was attractive and efficient, but certainly not warm or inviting.  The food came quickly and looked beautiful, but it lacked deep flavor, and the fish was overcooked and dry.  We seemed to be in a high traffic area (somewhat near the bar) and while many waitstaff ran past our table, our waiter was quite scarce.  Water glasses were left unfilled, and wine was not poured as needed.  
Overall,  that Chiltern is quite consistent.  From the moment that you arrive you will enjoy the look of the venue, the beauty of the staff, and the presentation of the food.  At the same time, the venue, staff and food lack any real depth and all seem to be going through the motions.  There are too many good food choices in London to pay top dollar at Chiltern Firehouse, only to leave feeling like something important was missing.",-1
5,"This was in my top 3 meals of all time. We were on vacation visiting my brother who works in London and he recommended we go to Chiltern Firehouse for our Thanksgiving dinner.
We were extremely lucky to get a reservation through a friend and it was definitely worth the ask! That night they had a Thanksgiving themed menu with the best sweet potato mash I've ever had. But the crown jewel of the night was our sommelier who went above and beyond bringing us different wines to taste, and obviously we obliged and ordered the bottles because his recommendations were impeccable.
If you get a chance to dine here I promise you won't be disappointed! The service and ambience was very refreshing, especially since it's such a hyped scene.",1
4,"The menu at this place is one of the most ""american"" in London. It has a ton of healthy options, really good salads and fresh fish when I was there last week. I enjoyed the appetizers the most. The beef tartar was well done, with the right balance of flavors and the right cut. The key lime pie was out of this world and so innovative, it was a shell with a creamy filling and ton of flavor. 
I love the ambiance of this place and some of London's finest agree too. On my last visit, Zaha Hadid was there with a bunch of people.
The service was perfect.",1
4,"I believe this was referred by my friend via goop. 
Great find for me in London, trendy spot for brunch.  We came here on the weekday where it wasn't crowded.  Between 2 ladies we shared the pancakes (fluffy and moist), crab scramble (good not great), and steamed white egg (yummy).  All were pretty small portions minus the pancakes, so I suggest sharing or getting more than one item to satisfy your cravings! 
Will be coming back, ciao!",1
2,"Overpriced average food wrapped in a nice decor sprinkled with attitude. Awful service and manager. You always have to wait for a table even with a reservation (even a famous actor was screaming at them), service is not what you would expect for these prices. Never again.",-1
5,"Wow - food, service, wine, ambiance, pretty people....
Great experience and one of the better culinary spots I've visited in Europe in recent years. Everything was spot on from the fried chicken snack, to the ravioli with truffles and fresh peas, to the grilled imberico. The polenta with buckwheat and truffles was one of the best things I've ever had. Service was over the top - very friendly and professional.
If you have the expense budget and you appreciate fine food this is a must visit in London...",1
3,I've been wanting to come here for a while so I was really looking forward to the experience. I ordered an appetizer salad as an entre as I wasn't expecting many vegan options so that was fine. Our table ordered a few bottles of wine to share and we had a really great time. Chiltern is definitely more for the experience (the decor is beautiful and the staff are amazing) than for the food but most of my friends thoroughly enjoyed what they ordered as well. Glad I got to come once but I'm not sure if I would come back.,-1
5,"My friend managed to snag this booking months in advance- don't ask me how it's done! London's hottest restaurant is frequented by celebrities who hail from near and far. Unfortunately on a Monday night, none of them were in sight, but the paparazzi were camped outside the entrance nonetheless. Upon arrival, I was greeted by no less than 5 members of staff before I even reached the hostess, and I was shown to my table immediately to await my friends. 
They have a lovely cute drinks/snack menu for those who are waiting, and the starters on there are different than the proper starters you can later order with dinner. And the one thing that struck me is that Chiltern is surprisingly affordable- you can get a glass of wine for £5, a bottle of wine for under £25, starters for £15ish, desserts for under £10, and mains are in the £25-30 range generally. We ordered the crab-filled doughnuts as a snack and got the Grenache blanc for wine... I don't think you can go wrong with the wine list, it's just a matter of price, and the doughnuts came highly recommended and the innovation did not disappoint.  
As a starter, I ordered the grilled octopus (served with aubergine, daikon, and mushrooms) with a lovely miso sauce. One of my friends ordered the sea trout crudo, which was basically sashimi served with some sort of fish roe (I am not into that, but if that is your sort of thing, you'd probably like it). For my main, I got the spring lamb, served with black garlic, goat's curd, and grilled lettuce. The goat's curd was interesting... it was like a sour cream kind of taste and texture. Unfortunately one of my friends ordered the roasted turbot and she got food poisoning later in the night, and we think that is the reason why. And for the dessert, there is a frozen panna cotta that was positively divine... you definitely have to try it! I also had the tokaji dessert wine which was the perfect finish. 
Overall, it was a great experience, but I just had to mention the food poisoning but I hope the restaurant makes amends! Other than that, the venue is surprisingly normal and there is no need for normal people to be intimidated :)",1
5,"Great atmosphere, great cocktails, great snacks, great presentation. Sumac Water melon was amazing.",1
4,Great food in decent portions and in a really classy setting. Get the bacon cornbread and the crab doughnuts - they're a must! Amazing staff and wonderful eggs florentine too... Tourists eyeing our food and speaking loudly were a little less amazing.,1
2,"Cannot say how disappointed we were last night. Our halibut came out cold, yet tasted like someone tried to finish it at the last minute with a butane torch. All other items were bland or over-sauced. While the room and scene were all superior, we cannot suggest anyone go here for the food. Just really poor.",-1
3,"Currently, this is the place to be and be seen due to it's celebrity clientele - so jumping on the band wagon, we headed to Chiltern Firehouse for Sunday Brunch.   
While the decor is beautiful; plush booths, an incredible tiled bar where you can watch the food being made and everything you'd really expect from a restaurant with such a great reputation, I was a little disappointed.  
 The staff cannot be faulted for their manners and service, they're attentive and helpful but at times it felt like they were a little too attentive. We'd barely been sat down two minutes before they had rushed over to take our order, and the food was as quickly set onto the table in front of us.   
Honestly, I can't fault the food - it was well presented, well cooked and tasted lovely, however I wouldn't say it was any better than some other cheaper restaurants in London. When you're paying such a high price tag, you would expect something a little more mind blowing than what we were served. The champagne cocktails were probably the highlight of the meal, while the coffee was weak and a little tasteless.   
Would I recommend this place? Sure, if only for the experience of saying you've been and done a little celeb spotting while you were at it - but sadly I feel that's probably the best feature of the place.",-1
2,"To say it's hard to get a booking is an understatement. I had to wangle a reservation from someone in the know for me and my friends.
PROS:
- You might see a celeb.
- The bar waiting area is very nice.
- The starters. The Venison Sausage Rolls was flavoursome and tasty. The Crab doughnuts. Now these were raved upon by many upon research and they are OK.
- They have some lovely house wine (so much so we continued to drink another bottle after)
- We sat at a table but the area where the chefs cook you can sit at.
- The Garden as you enter. Sat outside after eating and enjoying over hearing conversations amongst the rich.
- It's situated in a lovely area of Marylebone. Right opposite one of my fav places to unwind (Monocle Cafe).
CONS:
- The tables all feel a bit too tightly compact to one another.
- It all feel a bit stiff. Maybe it feels like the place to be seen rather than a place to go eat well. And I really couldn't wait to dine at somewhere Nuno Mendes was head chef.
- The eggs Benedict. Biscuit instead of muffin. I really would prefer a posh English muffin than an American dry biscuit. Disappointed to say the least.
- The Lobster Scrambled Eggs. Was horrible in all honesty. One way of ruining an expensive ingredient with one of the most simple. Avoid.
The problem with places like this is that the 'buzz', 'hype' and 'reputation' sometimes proceeds itself. And for those prices and mark up it is not worth it in terms of value. Unless of course you saw David Beckham or some world star perhaps... ;)",-1
3,"Despite the hype, food doesn't deliver the goods. Drinks were well made however. That said a table in the garden is nice to dine in.",-1
5,Absolutely delicious meal. Worth the extra $. Atmosphere was great. Everything from drinks to dessert was perfectly flavored. Must go.,1
5,"Having been to CF for drinks I was really looking forward to eating there, and was not disappointed.  We were seated on the patio which is much nicer than the dining room which can feel a bit cramped.
Starters: the best oyster I have ever had in my life, crab donuts, bacon cornbread, and a watermelon goats cheese salad that were all delicious.
Mains: most of our group had the lobster noodles, I went with the pork.  You know that moment when everyone likes what they are eating so much they stop talking?  We had one of those.
Perfect weather and lots of rosé helped but it really was a great meal.",1
5,"So we very accidentally came to Chiltern because we had been told to go to Purl, across the street.  We already had reservations elsewhere and just wanted to pop in for a drink.  My date had noticed the cool lighting outside in the courtyard, and like moths, we were drawn in.  We managed to visit one of the coolest bars and have some of the best drinks we've had in London.  I didn't say this was the cheapest place, but you definitely get what you pay for.",1
5,"We sat at the chefs counter and watched them cook! It was a great experience. All the waiters were very friendly and attentive and the food was wonderful. We got the rib eye, roasted cauliflower, bacon cornbread and watermelon ricotta salad. All was delicious but I absolutely loved the salad.",1
4,"This place is beautiful and the food is delicious. The service is good, although a bit strange that all the servers look identical. It is very hard to get reservations but i have a little tip for my fellow yelpers....if you go early and sit in the bar you can grab someones no-show reservation. This worked 1 of 2 times i tried it. If you dont get in at least you can have a glass of prosecco, people watch and check out the beautiful space.",1
5,"We recently went to Chiltern and it was awesome! The entire staff is incredibly nice, accommodating and tres chic (the hostess pantsuits are gorgeous!). We had the most amazing meal, each plate was better than the last, and they even gave us dessert, on the house, because we were celebrating our honeymoon. Everyone went out of their way to make us feel special. The sommelier paired the perfect wine with our meal and the bar tenders make a mean dirty martini (hard to come by in London, if you can believe it). The ambience was warm, inviting and very romantic! We will definitely be returning on our next trip to London.",1
5,"Delicious and a great atmosphere! Had the Fire Drill cocktail that was so tasty. A few MUST HAVES: Starters and snacks - corn fritters, octopus and Jerusalem artichokes all amazing!! We had the Iberico pork and the cauliflower for mains that were both excellent. And then there was dessert.... milk and honey was SOOO GOOD as was the key lime pie. It took us 2 months to get a reservation at 18:00 on a Wednesday and by 20:00 they were definitely waiting to turn the table.  Definitely worth it.",1
5,"I am completely in love with this place, and so happy that Viajante's replacement is such a standout. Nuno has done it again. 
Yup, it's in a former firehouse. This new space is warm and sexy and has a sense of place -- similar to Viajante. Now that it's less of a trek to get to, it seems to be a magnet for famous people. But you should go here because it is great and lovely. The ceiling looks like it is covered with the burlap strap woven bottoms of the seats of antique chairs. 
Sit at the ""chef's table"" (the bar) and watch the action at a 10+ foot long stove, custom made by some company in America. Getting that shipped out must have been quite an undertaking.
The cocktail list is incredible. I was waiting for my dining companion and enjoyed what I believe was called ""love in a cold place"" -- all of my favorite things in a glass. 
I'd had the Iberico pork steak at one of the Portuguese nights at Viajante, and it was great here, too. 
Sadly no frozen olive oil candies, but they do give you some chocolates to finish the meal.
Gluten-free notes: Many (half or more) of the dishes on the menu are gluten-free. They know what gluten is and can help you out. Unfortunately no freshly baked cumin rolls like Viajante had.",1
5,"What can I say? This place is on another level. I love that it was a former firehouse, adds so much character! It is a trendy hotspot with incredible service and sensational food. Hands down one of my favourite dining experiences.",1
5,"A friend couldn't make her dinner and gave us her booking and oh my goodness what a treat that was! The service was impeccable, the atmosphere was great and the food divine... Highly recommended",1
5,"Very classy English style. Atmosphere and service splendid. Food also very tasty.
Out of the 4 dishes we ordered, only the rib is not very tasty, all others are awesome.",1
5,"Everything about this restaurant exceeded expectations.  I was afraid it would be a tad over hyped and it wasn't.  We ate at the chef's counter because we were not able to get a reservation for a regular table and I am glad we had this experience which allowed us to watch the chefs in action.  The atmosphere is great and the service is impeccable, friendly, and unpretentious.  The food was outstanding as well.  The zucchini starter, the crab donuts, the caesar salad, the pumpkin gnocchi, and the chicken were all delicious.  These are very talented chefs, serving quality food with very fresh ingredients in an unpretentious setting.  We even purchased the cookbook and attempted to make a reservation for the next evening (unfortunately they were booked solid, but I can see why)  This isn't one of those places that makes it difficult to get a reservation to appear desirable... the food is that good and the reservation dept will do their best to accommodate you.  Next time our travels take us to London I am making sure to make at least one reservation at this restaurant.  I live in New York City and I have never had service this welcoming and accommodating at any restaurant.  When we were leaving they called a cab for us and held an umbrella over my fiance as we walked out of the building.  These small gestures all helped make a great experience.",1
5,"It was our second last night in London and we were looking for chic London cuisine-Both Foursquare and Yelp pointed us towards The Chilton Firehouse.  After zigzagging through the streets for quite a while we finally found it.  Speaking to the Maitre d' we were lucky enough to secure two seats at the chef's table. We were greeted very warmly by Rafal who would be our server for the evening.  We started out with a wonderful full bodied Italian red. The first course chosen was the crab stuffed donuts which proved to be light and delicious.  The second course chosen was the pumpkin porridge-truly fantastic with hazelnuts and chestnuts on top.  Perfect balance! Growing up eating wild game my father hunted I was thrilled to find venison on the menu which was enthusiastically encouraged by Rafal. It was such a pleasure to watch the hustle of the kitchen as everyone worked fluidly to create some exquisite looking plates-every dish was tended to like a work of art! The venison(ordered medium rare) did not disappoint! Smoky, juicy and balanced out with a pecan pesto and a teriyaki-glazed chard. Every bite was beyond delectable! After asking us a few questions, Rafal suggested the frozen apple pannacotta for dessert and it couldn't have been more perfect! Rafal's charm and wit made our experience incredibly enjoyable. As the meal came to a close Rafal brought a picture perfect cappuccino that tasted as perfect as it looked. Shifting to the bar for a nice after dinner drink-a special Zacapa rum was chosen. The bartenders were equally wonderful, charming and a joy to watch as they mixed endless cocktails with precision and ease. Our experience will be talked about for a very long time! THANK YOU!",1
5,"This was one of the best meals I have had in recent memory. The atmosphere is fantastic, the crowd of beautiful people is nice, the service is warm and excellent... But to top all that off with this menu and the mind blowing execution of our orders? Just wow. This is a new place and I am sure the magic can't last. Does it ever? But cheers to one of the best recent restaurant experiences I've had not only in London, but in my two home towns New York and Los Angeles as well.",1
5,This review is for the lounge - just lovely. My favourite place to dance into the early hours.,1
5,The Chiltern Firehouse is possibly my favorite restaurant and club in all of London. The interior is warm and provides various nooks for private conversations. The entire building and patio are meticulously maintained.,1
4,"Went for dinner on Saturday night. Atmosphere was lovely. I'd go again just for that. Service was also good and very friendly. They told us we had to be finished in 2 1/2 hours which was a pity because we would have stayed on and had desert and more drinks. I'm not a fan of restaurants that move you out, especially if you're spending big as we were. Cocktails were very nice. Starters of crab donuts and octopus were excellent but main courses were just ok. Maple sweet potato mash was the consistency of baby food and far too sweet. Could only taste maple. Sadly, all the food was totally over salted. The whole table said so. Apart from the crab donuts (which were gorgeous), octopus and maple mash everything, without exception was salty and this is coming from people who love highly-seasoned food. Still, service and atmos was good enough that we'll be back. Also, it's a shame they save the pretty courtyard as a ""sacred space"" for hotel guests. It remained more or less completely empty whereas we could have been continuing our evening and spending money!",1
4,"Very discreet from the street; inside extremely classy and elegant. I adored the hallways and bar area was simply beautiful. I had booked a table for my daughter & myself, the staff were wonderfully accommodating with her, fixing posh juices, shaking her hand giving her a super cute little dessert! Our waiter from Spain (Pierre?) was a stand out as was the bar tender in the main bar area. Would have given 5* alas there was no soup on the menu, which on a freezing day - we were craving!!",1
5,Really good food. Nice range of dishes from the quite simple to the complex... There is also a good price range to cater for people on different budgets. The staff were also very polite and knowledgeable.,1
4,"If you follow any celeb press you will know this is THE place to be in London.  Not sure why it has such a following and not sure why the paparazzi didn't photograph me, but oh well.
The place is very pretty and if you can get near the seats by the kitchen that looks to be fun.  The space is very pretty although lacks soul and the women all walk around in these monochrome brightly colored jumpsuits that look like they are from Star Trek.  Bizarre.
For those that had been to Viajante, expect something very different--whereas Viajante was very creative, experimental and playful--this is much more subtle, orchestrated and refined.  Crab donuts, octopus appetizer, the pork and fish dishes were all very good.  No complaints.  But I wasn't wowed over either.
With all the celeb buzz good luck getting in, but sit back and enjoy if you do.",1
4,"This place is spectacular! I love that they converted this place into a restaurant-super cool. Sadly, they were too packed to seat us for dinner, but we sat by the bar for cocktails and light appetizers. The cocktails were delightful! The apps were very nice too. Next time I am here I will definitely try dinner too!",1
4,"Loved the ambiance and trendy feeling
Got a 9,30pm thru a VIP friend and had a good time. We loved the trendy and casual chic ambiance and the food was pretty good too. We only ordered a bunch of small plates and the bacon maple cornbread was the best! Also the chicken bites and the gnocchi. The famous crab doughnuts were nothing special though, Quite bland actually! But above all I liked getting to know what all the hype was about --and it was fun.
Visited October 2015",1
5,"London's current hotspot that shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon. Great scene, amazing bartenders and phenomenal cocktails. Makes for a lively (and highly amusing evening out)",1
5,"We had the snug room, the food was amazing , the staff are excellent and the drink menu and wine list is brilliant .",1
4,"It's a fun place to visit.  We celebrated my partner's sister's BD there, and we had a fantastic time.  Food was not so memorable, but drink was incredible.  After we enjoyed champaign by the glass, our sommelier did a great job recommending a beautiful bottle of Burgundy Pinot Noir.  Dessert wine was also great.  Service was excellent.  Servers were amazingly attentive for such a packed restaurant.  I will be happy to go back.",1
5,"Amazing place - old fire-house converted to restaurant. Great ambiance, amazing service and the most wonderful brunch. Not the cheapest but definitely worth every penny",1
5,"Great service, amazing atmosphere and very creative dishes. I ordered almost everything on the menu, loved the appetizers, entrees (main) was good; but I recommend just ordering a whole bunch of appetizers and maybe one main. Our waiter was super friendly, even took us on a tour around the kitchen. PS go check out the secret hidden smoking area. Pretty bad a$$!",1
5,"Came here for birthday drinks with one of my best friends. The decor of the horseshoe shaped bar is beautiful. Even though our servers took ages to bring our drinks, they were so sweet, I couldn't get upset (and I could because it was my birthday). Also there was a bulldog and puppy circling around and guests were surprisingly sweet and responsive towards the adorable animals. All in all, great experience.",1
5,"This review is for the hotel. Seriously, impeccable service. They somehow know your name from the second you arrive and go out of their way to make you feel taken care of. Oh, and the bedrooms have fireplaces.",1
5,"Wow! Beautiful place, food, people, ambiance, service!  One of the best restaurants I've ever been to hands down. Our server, Joanna was fabulous. Great recommendations, very knowledgable about menu items. We started with cornbread made with bacon grease served with a chipotle butter. Also has two bottles of excellent New Zealand sauvegnon blanc. Our appetizers were grilled octopus, oysters and burrata cheese. Everything was amazing. The seasonings really come out in the flavor, unbelievable. For entrees, I had the monkfish, daughter had halibut and husband and other daughter had the pork. All dishes were works of art and simply incredible. Our desserts also were to die for. We shared a key lime pie, a chocolate fish and a mandarin sorbet. We got a tour of hotel and rooms after dinner which was lovely. Great bar and intimate feel, highly recommend this place!",1
4,Very lovely restaurant with a classy and well mannered crowd. Food modern and delicious and not as outrageously expensive as you would imagine. Entire feel of the place reminded me of an upmarket Californian restaurant.Particularly stunning gardens and entryway. Not quite as exclusive as it was last year so a little easier to book a reservation and can often stroll up just to use the restaurant's bar.,1
4,"First things first. Everyone has a beard here. The doorman. The waiter. Chefs. The other wAiter. And not your designer stubble either. These are PROPER beards. This is a very style conscious place. But regardless, the food was great. Best bits though were the sides, the starters and the desserts. The latter were especially creative not least the key lime pie and the apple panaccota. As for the sides, try the fried chicken and crab doughnuts. The mains were solid but nothing out of the ordinary. The exception was the fillet steak, wonderful smoky flavour and so tender.",1
2,"All that glitters is not gold. The disparity between the hype and the reality of the Chiltern firehouse was so extreme it needed calling out.
This is a beautiful location and it's buzzing, but once inside it felt like you were part of a machine designed to get you in and out, and onto the next guest.
Above all, it was the lack of consistency in terms of food and service that was astounding.
Too fast to take orders & way too slow to deliver them. Food was brought to the table out of sequence. Insipid cocktails, staff with a lack of basic knowledge on the drinks / food offering. The signature dish, 'Pork Iberico', was tough & dry and, worst of all, the 'maple sweet potato' side dish was so sweet it was inedible.
The whole operation appeared almost random, apparently lacking an authoritative maitre d' to ensure it flowed professionally.
There were several highlights, including some of the food dishes (Carrot blunts, Short rib, Octopus), but way too few to warrant the price and the reputation, especially when London has so many other great restaurants.
The one saving grace was our main server, who was excellent -  she was the only redemption for a venue that has built a reputation for being coolest eatery in town, yet completely lacked the attention to detail to deserve that accolade.",-1
5,"Fun and charming place with great food. A fun night out in London if you like  a casual place, great food and a good wine list.",1
5,"Thank you so much for making my husband's 50th Birthday even more special!  I wanted to thank everyone at Chiltern Firehouse for the fabulous meal and experience while we were in London.  I especially want to thank the bartender who crafted a beautiful handmade cocktail especially for my husband and delivered it to our table with a message from our sons who could not be with us.  The restaurant and bar were packed, so I truly appreciate his efforts and my husband was blown away by the whole thing. Again, thank you for the lovely atmosphere, the outstanding food, the interesting crowd and a very special thank you to the bartender!!!!",1
3,"Sad to say that the hype may have gotten the best of this restaurant.
The small bites, appetizers and desserts were all fantastic. Well prepared and presented. The main courses we ok, but nothing spectacular. No real complaints, just nothing to write home about. While the restaurant has an excellent wine list, it is grotesquely overpriced. It's aimed towards those who want to be seen spending money, not those interested in drinking a great wine.
Our main waiter was very friendly. However, there seems to be overall poor communication between the staff. We would ask for a drink or bread and the message never seemed to be passed on - disappointing for a restaurant of this calibre. Having to re-ask for things multiple times is tiresome. The sommelier also left something to be desire as far as friendliness goes.
The atmosphere and décor are lovely and comfortable. Modern European with an open kitchen.
If you're prepared for the fact that it's over-hyped, you'll have a good dinner.",-1
5,I loved my experience at Chiltern Firehouse. Although it was very difficult to get a reservation it was worth it. The caesar salad was excellent. My fish dish was flakey and moist inside and crisp on the outside. The service was perfect and I will make a reservation long before I travel to London to go back again!,1
5,Best Eggs Benedict I have ever had. There was a little snobbiness when I asked for a side of potatoes but I quickly got over it as the food was delicious and we were able to get it without a reservation. Yum. Ambience was fabulous too!,1
1,"The decor is super and our waiter was fabulous, however, when the starter came wrong and we complained the manger Jonathan arrived who had the wrong attitude. He was more keen to prove us wrong than correct the mistake. We booked a table for 5, a few weeks ago but were given a table for 4 with a seat in the passage for the 5th. Don't be excited to visit as they overbook and have arrogance.
I think once the popularity wears out this place will be a disaster as needs to pay attention to the customer.",-1
1,"The most pretentious place I have ever eaten at. You can read all the other reviews about the decor and the setting which is quite spectacular. The place is a scene to be seen and for those to see you. From the moment you arrive you are greeted by the outside bellman/bouncers? and looked up and down before you are delivered off to another chap who walks you thorough the maze to the hostess. 
Picture this, we went for breakfast on a Monday morning with four people and there was only a handful of tables occupied with about 25 staff people milling around trying to look busy. It was amazing the number of staff present for Monday morning breakfast.
We place our order for breakfast, with only one request, that one of the egg dishes be cooked well done. (no running yokes) Simple enough for any breakfast cook.
When the dish arrived, the yoke was still runny and we asked if we could get the order done as requested. The look and attitude that we received from the waitress was "" I told them to cook it the way you wanted"". It went back to the kitchen and was recooked.
Then I took a bite of my french toast, it was totally raw inside, with the milk and egg oozing out. I asked another waitress if the chef could finish cooking the french toast and she brought the dish back to the kitchen.
About 5 minutes later our waitress delivered us the following message from the Chef. "" I will be happy to cook you another french toast, but it will come out the same way as before"" OMG Any five year old can cook french toast!  I was ready to get up and go in the kitchen and show the chef how to make the simplest of breakfast foods.
It just wasn't worth the effort. 
I guess the celebs like their food un cooked. This place is not worth the time nor the effort, especially when there is such a big disconnect between the kitchen, staff and guest.
They obviously did not recognize who we were......
but I hope for all you reading this, you don't support such an unwelcoming place that can't train its staff and kitchen about basic customer service, considering they have so many people on duty.",-1
4,"A place you come just to be seen.  I was seen and I saw.  The food which was dinner was good.  I love snobby atmospheres, and we got into the lounge after which was fun. Dinner was nothing to write home about but then again I don't write much.",1
1,"If I have to be honest, I have traveled extensively and you certainly get the feeling here that if your not a famous face your not worth much. We had a meeting in the less that par conference room and we're constantly harassed by the staff after hours as to wether or not we were staying at the hotel or not. For the over all price I do not see the value",-1
2,"This place is the worst.  The crowd is old and wannabe.  Not contemporary or for the young, successful,  and attractive at ALL. The people there did not look good.
   This place claims to be elite but probably was 2 years ago.  We had dinner there and the food was tasteless and very average.  On top of that, they said we could get to the main bar area, and after having us spend so much money on crappy food, they did not let us in to the main bar, claiming they were at ""full capacity"".  Then when trying to leave, they tried to be ""gracious"" by hailing us a taxi out of a strange back ally.  The taxi, we realized while already on the road, was cash only, and took us on a completely round about route, which cost twice as much as any taxi we had taken for the same distance.  When we confronted the taxi driver, threatening to report him,  he gave us a discount.  
    All and all, we had a terrible and expensive experience being ripped off at the Chiltern Firehouse.  Don't believe the hype. Just don't go here.",-1
5,"Had an amazing dinner saturday night at Chiltern. The full review is on my blog with loads of pictures. Usually the hottest places don't deliver on either food or service, here they deliver on everything. The food was creative and fun, the service was happy and it was as buzzy as it gets.",1
5,Excellent food. Great service but rushed a little at first. Interesting desserts. Sort of loud but in a good environment. Chocolate ice cream was strong but good. We had  very positive experience. A great way to end our London trip.,1
4,"I loved the decor and food but no where in all my travels, and there have been many, did a waiter as us to hurry it along.  Mind you, this is an expensive lunch, we certainly didn't linger long.  I guess his huff when we didn't order the moment he set the wine down should have been a clue.",1
