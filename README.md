# Sentiment Mining on Yelp Reviews

This was a project on text sentiment mining from Yelp reviews. The following techniques were used:

- Preprocessing on the review text doing n-grams, tokenization, pos-tagging, stopwords and lemmatization
- Negation to get better accuracies 
- Classification with Naive Bayes, SVM and Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM)
- Aspect Mining 
- Information Extraction
