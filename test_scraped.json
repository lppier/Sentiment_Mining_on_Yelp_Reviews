It was so refreshing, loved the crunchy texture and marinated perfectly. The frankfurters actually worked well adding some meaty sweetest to the dish, to balance out the sourness.\nChicken sour spicy la-mian noodles. \nI didn't expect the broth to be so umami and flavoursome. It had depth and a nice balance sourness as well as a good punch of spice from the chilli without being numbing. The noodles was full of bounce and generous, made long so it provided a really satisfying bite. The wood ear fungus gave a crunch to it and this was contrasted with the softer tofu. The chicken was a bit dry but that was the only compliant I have\nStewed beef Dao Xiao Mian (chopped noodles) in soup. \nThe broth was delicious and complex, once again full of flavour and depth. Sadly the noodles weren't as satisfying for me being short and doughy. It felt I spent more time chewing on the noodles than the enjoying the broth with it. Next time I might have it with the La Mian as the beef was spot on being incredibly tender and fragrant, with strong notes of the sweet soy braising marinating sauce. Nice addition of pak choi for a refreshing green taste and crunch.\nSteamed pork and chive dumplings \nThese were poorly made. The dough was too thick and chewy masking all the flavours of the meatball and the broth inside it. The meatball itself was nice and sweet, well marinated and juicy.\nFish ball BBQ skewer and lamb BBQ skewer \nThese were lovely and fragrant. It had a nice kick to it from the spice. The lamb was meaty and lean which was nice compared to all the fatty ones we've had. Fish balls were soft and bouncy with good umami flavours. It was great not to have a minimum order on them too like most places that sell skewers.\nChive and egg pie\nThis was very moreish. I love the doughy thin pastry, pan fried for a little bit of crisp around the edges. It was a bit greasy too but that kept it moist. Inside was a delicious filling of peppery chives mixed with silky eggs.\nI left so satisfied with Lanzhou Noodle Bar. For just \u00a36.50 for each of the noodle soups it makes me question why a simple miso ramen can cost double that. It's cool how you can see the noodles made in the open preparation kitchen by the chef and the skilled involved.

Initially I was really excited to have found this place but the customer service has always been awful. I thought I could just deal with it because the food is decent but yesterday was a new low.\nMy flatmate and I both ordered the fried pork chop noodle soup. The only difference is that she wanted the thin noodles and I wanted the thicker noodles. We also ordered pig ears with cucumber and some fried dumplings. When they brought the noodles my flatmate's order was correct but mine was wrong. Instead of a noodle soup they gave me greasy fried noodles. I wasn't upset at all, I used to work as a waitress and I totally understand that mistakes can be made. I informed the waitress that it wasn't what I had ordered. She started yelling the name of the order at me and insisted it was what I ordered. She eventually took the plate of noodles and carried it around the restaurant looking for the waitress I had ordered with. In a bit the waitress who brought my noodles and the waitress who I ordered with came to speak to me together and insisted that I had ordered the fried noodles. I told them over and over again I had ordered the fried pork chop noodle soup, not fried noodles. I'd eaten at this restaurant at least 5 times at this point and I always order the same thing so I know I didn't order incorrectly. At this point they started to yell and roll their eyes at me. When they turned around and started going up the stairs the waitress I ordered with began to talk badly about me and scream profanities in Chinese as she walked up the stairs. I don't think she realized I speak Chinese because I have a perfect American accent. \nAt this point my flatmate and I were kind of upset that she had rudely screamed about me in another language just 2 feet away from our table. I was debating whether or not to leave or go but I really didn't want to start any drama so I decided to wait and see if she would bring me the correct order. She came back really quickly (maybe 2 minutes tops) with a bowl of noodle soup. I was so relieved when I first saw it because I thought the drama would be over. When I looked down I was really confused because the broth was extremely dark and the noodles were brown as well. I realized that what the restaurant had done was pour hot water over the fried noodles to make it into \"noodle soup.\" It was really gross. I turned to her and asked her if they had just poured hot water over the fried noodles. She looked at me and said no that's just beef broth. Beef broth is not that dark. I pointed to my flatmate's bowl (which is the same exact order as mine) and I said that her broth was clear. I also said I had eaten here many times before and I know what the soup and noodles are supposed to look like. She continued to lie to me and insisted that they had used beef broth for my soup and that's why it was a darker color. At this point I realized arguing was futile. I told her my flatmate and I were going to leave but I would still pay for her soup and the appetizer we ordered (even though we had barely touched them.) When we got to the cashier he didn't charge us for my soup but he tried to charge us for the dumplings that we never received. I didn't even really care about the money, I was just upset with the consistent lies and scheming. I told him we had never received them and asked him to take it off the bill. He eventually did after arguing with us and the total for food we barely touched was 18\u00a3. I paid that and even tipped too.\nThe food in this restaurant is decent but the service is not.

I ordered the beef brisket (most people on yelp seems to have done that) as it was recommended by the guy at the door and I though there was a lot of noodles, there was enough beef that I was happy. They only gave me 2 pieces of veg though and I really wanted more of that.\nPrice: \u00a36.50 for beef brisket hand pulled noodles. Not bad for the price.

From the window you can see a steam table with a bunch of dishes. You know, the classics like fried rice, chow mien, orange chicken, etc. Don't be fooled. Walk in and you will see that there is a man making hand pulled noodles right behind the steam table, and there are a few tables for eating. Sit down, get a menu and order one of the noodle dishes! Also, if you're looking for some type of ambience, you won't find it here. This is no frills, the long communal tables in the back (yes, you might be sharing a table with strangers) are just there so you can eat your food and then get out. \nWe're all about the noodle soups and I love both types of noodles. If you like thicker noodles, get the \"dao xiao mian\" which is knife cut noodles. If you like them thinner, go with the \"la mian\" which is hand pulled - though you can get the la mian in different thicknesses as well (skinny to fat to flat). They're all good and always perfectly al dente. They have a bunch of different noodle soups but we usually get the stewed or sliced beef. They are both our favorite. If you like it spicy, add some of the hot chili sauce on the table, so good! The only misstep we've had (and why it is 4 instead of 5 stars) is the fish noodle soup. It was incredibly bland. The noodles were good but the broth had no flavor. In our opinion, the beef options are where they shine!\nIf you want to try some of their other dishes, we've had their mapo tofu - definitely a no. It comes with peas and carrots and isn't the slightest bit spicy. Their dumplings actually didn't fare much better as the skin was way too thick. The one standout that we have had would be the pig ear with cucumber. Totally refreshing due to the immense amount of garlic (don't eat this if you're on your way to a date, dancing, um, really anything that involves close human contact) that they mix everything in along with some vinegar. While pig ear is definitely not for everyone, I actually really enjoy it and Lanzhou makes a very good version of this classic dish!\nLastly, the best part is they are open SUPER late. If you're out in Soho for the night and want something to eat other than a kebab at 2am, this is your place. I don't know about you, but this is my perfect end-of-night meal. :)"}, "190": {"rating": 5, "review": "Difficult to find but enter a small world where you see only Chinese people sitting here and eating.

First, as we arrived to check out the menu through the glass window--since there is not an online version we took our time reviewing (I didn't want to go in straight away because it often takes my children a long time to decide what to eat). We were stared at without a greeting by a host person for a few minutes, which didn't bother me too much, but just felt odd. Upon entering we were asked how many (again even though this person had been staring at our family for nearly 5 minutes, he asked), and then promptly seated in the back on a picnic table (next to a sink full of dirty dishes). Although Yelpers had stated the restaurant takes card, I wanted to verify, and asked the host. He stated \"only \u00a320 more. Don't have, leave, get.\" Estimating that our family would easily surpass this guideline, we stayed seated. Not a big deal, but they serve both Pepsi and Coke products (\u00a31 for a can, 20p more for Coke? Strange, but okay). Now came time to order or so we thought. The waitress was friendly, but was really pushing with regards to the menu \"noodles are specially, you order noodles,\" she took our drink orders, and walked away. I totally get it, noodles are the thing here. She returned with the drinks a few minutes later. The majority of our party went for noodles. Of note, the one dish that was not noodles, was served with steamed rice (some good parts, many parts were hard and clumped). However this dish was Kong pao chicken, and the chicken/sauce made up for the lame rice. Back to the other dishes: noodles were amazing, we had a dry chicken dish and sour/spicy chicken noodle soup. No issues with these noodle dishes at all. We also had very good crispy spring rolls! Yet, back to the issues of service. Having never been there before, we were unsure of where to pay/how to pay. I got up and asked the host, and he only pointed me to the cash register, then screamed across the restaurant at the cashier. I never received or was even able to review my bill. I attempted to follow the addition on the register (everything seemed to line up until the last items), this is where a mysterious \u00a35.20 was added to the bill. I asked, and the cashier responded \"VAT, card charge.\" Card charge didn't make sense as I was never notified of this when I asked before, but not willing to argue, and ready to go, I said nothing further. Yet, I suspect this is the main reason many people can't give the restaurant better ratings: the interactions. I want to see my bill. It was a good meal, and I'm willing to pay for it, but if you cannot explain to me why I am paying x\u00a3 for my food, I don't want to return.

They'll seat you wherever they've got room (friends and I got plastic stools handed to us at one of the outside tables once...) and when you're ready, order your noodles. The classic beef noodle soup is amazing, as is the thicker cut beef stir-fry noodles. Their vegetable dishes are done well, too. One note - they only sell bottled water or soft drinks.

Even from my place in line outside of the restaurant I could see the chefs pulling the noodles by hand.  Wow that was a sight I have not seen outside of China.  The broth was very authentic and I snorted that bowl in 15 minutes.  No wonder the line moved  so fast haha.  I then proceeded to visit that noodle place every night for the next 3 nights.

We said we'd wait, then they found found us a better table and gave the other one to the next sucker.\nFood: maybe we ordered the wrong thing. Of course we got the noodles, one of each type, but I got mine 'dry' not realizing that dry meant flavourless, and that it only comes in a wide noodle. My g/f got the other noodle, fried, wide; that one tasted OK but big lumps of pasty flour tasting noodle where it obviously wasn't 'pulled' correctly, or cooked long enough.

The stewed beef was ok, but I prefer the one from the La Mian stall on Brick Lane.  A big positive is the tub of chilli on the side, I just can't resist the stuff, even if it makes my nose drip and my brow glisten.\nAt \u00a36.50 a bowl, you can't really go wrong here.

The soup was overflowing with wontons which was great, but the flavor was mild.  I expected the crispy beef with chili to have some heat to it, and it may have, but this was cut by its sweetness.

My favorite dish was the prawns, which I thought was very light but well-flavored. I also liked the monk vegetable dish, which came with stir-fried tofu, mushrooms, and other greens. The honey barbecue pork though...I wasn't a fan - it was very difficult to chew and was too heavy on the sauce, in my opinion.\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal here (despite the service in the beginning) and the food definitely satisfied my craving for Chinese food.

You get different servers who bring you what you have ordered and some of them are smiling, some of them are not - but who cares? I feel like people who leave bad reviews just because not every server smiled at them when they put the food down is just looking to get their egos stroked.

Furthermore, in order to get our last plate to come out, we tried to flag a waiter down several times, only to be either ignored or unseen. One of the members of my party had to get up and talk to one of them in order to get them to bring the last dish out.

But instead, they served them one at a time. With a crowd of 6, it was a bit awkward. Not for nothing,  it would've been ok if their servings were enough for 6, but when a dish comes out good for 1 or 2 people,  a restaurant should be thoughtful enough to think ahead.  But not Zuma I guess. The plates went from one side of the table back & forth. All of you can request them to do that next time you dine to avoid this. \nThey offer you two types of water, still or gas.  We got both. My preference was still.The server was in a rush to kick us out towards the end of our meal that he poured seltzer into my glass which totally ruined my water. Extremely a huge faux pax!\nMy miso soup was ok. It tasted like a regular. Nothing exceptional.The Edamame were just medium sized. We get plumper Edamames in the US. The Wagyu Beef, I was excited to try,  but they were tasteless.  I'm wondering if they didn't season them for a reason except drizzled peppers on top of them? So not impressive.  I'm very particular w/ my steak. The only steak so far that impressed me the most came from Ruth's Chris & John Howies. Other than that, I make my own & my kids rather eat the steak I make than to eat outside at a restaurant. This steak was a fail. As for the Sushis & Makis, we are from the Pacific Northwest & we've traveled to far & wide where Sushis almost a staple.. conveyor belts of Sushis graze airports & restaurants like a fast food joint. I've tasted the best sushis in Washington & Japan. This one was just mediocre. But I can say the seafood they used was of exceptional quality.  That is commendable. But that does not say much of its flavors. Likewise, the eggplant salad, it was ok, but nothing memorable. It didn't leave anything in my palate wanting for more.  You have to put a zinger!\nBut there is one dish Zuma did right & tasted wonderful! That's the Soft shelled crab! It was perfectly fried, cut, soft, crusted & seasoned,  perfectly presented w/a side of lemon as it should be for every seafood, & a dipping sauce.  It reminded me of the flavors of the ocean w/ a hint of garlic & a touch of citrus,  totally satisfying in every bite. I would totally get just 2 orders of that & a bowl of rice & I'd be happy at Zuma. \nFor what could've been $100 worth of a dinner in the US or at any Sushi place, we spent \u20ac350 w/c is equivalent to $485. So be prepared if you want to spend that much. If it is just to scratch off a bucket list, think twice.. I'd say totally NOT worth it. Explore the world,  there's better places to get better food out there,  you just have to discover it yourself."}, "404": {"rating": 5, "review": "Cool / fancy place to have some great japanese food!

Nice!\nFive minutes later (after about 20 waiting), the hostess found us and sat us.  The Sommelier came over to talk to us (a charming young American with an excellent pairing knowledge), and helped us make a great choice (sadly, not the Petrus). Then, the food.

All 15 dishes we tried had flavors that definitely rival the greatest restaurants around the world. You will not be disappointed. Sushi rivals Nobu & Morimoto even though the sushi portions seemed slightly smaller.  The fire grilled meat & seafood (Robata) are done perfectly every time. \n     If it's just two of you get a pair of the 15 seats that surround the grill and watch the cooks in action. You will be very impressed by the level of detail that goes into each dish. The menu is extensive, each dish is a unique creation of well paired flavors.

The receptionist indicated that they could seat us, but they needed the table back at 8:30 PM.  We indicated no problem.\nWe told the waiter that we had a time limit, he assured us there would be no problem.

Though, the service still leaves an incredible amount to be desired, considering the price point.\nLet's start with the sushi.  At best, it's \"not bad.\"  Typically, the sushi rice should be about room temperature to warm -- mine was cold, as if it had been in the fridge.  The fish should be chilled to cool, but mine was room temperature, as if it had been taken in and out of a cold area too many times in the evening that it was no longer cool or firm.  The botan ebi was mushy.  The toro was not marbled at all, and I'm confident at most places, they would simply call it tuna.  The sake (salmon) was ribbed and stringy. \nI also ordered soft shell crab.  It was good. Honestly, probably the best part of the meal, but the bar here is low. If you've had one fried softshell crab with a wasabi mayo, you've had them all.  They did not mess this up, and it was good. \nNow let's switch to the service -- three complaints -- \n1) The sushi bar was not full, is claimed to be first-come, first-serve, but they refused to seat me without making me wait for 30 minutes.  When they did seat me, they put us in two seats that had been empty the entire time I was at the cocktail bar.  I have no idea who they were saving them for since again, it's first-come, first-serve at the sushi bar. \n2) The waitress was very nice and took my order promptly, and the food came promptly, but it took multiple requests and a lot of waiting to get a bottle of still water. We were mostly through our softshell crab by the time a bottle of water finally arrived. I stopped short of going up to the cocktail bar to order my own.\n3) At the end, the waitress brought the check, and had tacked on a ton of food and drinks I didn't order.  It was our check, but like it had been merged with someone else's.  When I pointed this out, she basically made me review my own check again, instead of realizing I hadn't ordered half the things on the bill.\nIn the end, go to Nobu if you want sushi. It's cheaper and the service and quality are substantially better, across repeat visits. I should come back and try the robata grill.  For the price (which is very expensive) and reputation of this place, none of the above should have happened or been tolerated.

The staff doesn't have the attitude I saw more of in the other branches. Ex: The Dubai branch charged us a ton for ordering chili sauce and chilli pepper flakes because, as they put it, anything else you put on the food would ruin the quality of it.

Next time I'm in London, I'll be back.\nSo why only four stars?  Because the service was worse than awful.  I've been there twice at the sushi bar, and both times (different) servers seemed really irritated to have to bring people food, take orders, get drinks, etc.  Both nights (with different people) we were forgotten about for stretches of time, and both nights there were really odd pacing issues with the meal that didn't seem attributable to the pace of food from the kitchen.\nSo, while this place is worth a trip--the food is that good--the service keeps it from being among the very best of the best."}, "442": {"rating": 3, "review": "Honestly the food was better at Nobu.

Our group didn't have to wait much to be seated (reserved for 7pm), and once we were there the army of attentive staff just kept it all coming with impressive efficiency.\nZuma is all about the 'family style' arrangement of food, and the host of our particular group did just that as he proceeded to order a large selection of dishes for everyone. Once the first platter arrived, it seemed to never end as we were brought plate after plate of beautifully presented and masterfully crafted seafood, fish, and meats. My glass never stayed more than half empty either which was comforting, as the sake (they have many to choose from) was a delight.\nSince I didn't actually do the ordering I have no idea what the dishes are called but there were a few notable things you should look to try when you go.\n-Chopped scallops with a wasabi dressing of some sort\n-Black Cod (i'd heard of this in other reviews, and my god is it good)\n-sweet corn tempura dish kind of looks like popcorn and is highly addictive.\n-The sashimi is also top notch\nThe only thing that was slightly unpleasant was that we were effectively asked to make way for the next reservation toward the end. As far as I'm aware they give you some sort of warning beforehand about this, but after an enjoyable night with a hefty tab mounting it's not so nice to have to go stand at the crowded bar again when all you want to do is sit back a bit and carry on the conversation.\nHowever, all that aside, Zuma was an experience I highly recommend and the food was really quite excellent.

Therefore, working on the basis that the snitch is always right, until they spew out the goodies, I have been accommodating.\nWould I choose to eat here by myself or with a friend? No!\nWhy? Well, to be very frank, the cuisine is not always constant. Whether the owners have a dose of 'Change the Chef often before he get's lazy' or whether that character is fickle, I have no idea. I haven't attempted to grill him to find out. I only take the bright lights to put in politicians eyes, besides, Chefs are usually already conditioned to heat.\nI am presuming that the restaurant was named after Zuma Beach in Malibu, California and the owners have spent time there watching the Beach Babes and not enough time watching the staff - or perhaps too much time watching the staff nick the silver, because every time I have been there, I see new faces, but same type of menu. Which I should mention always looks superb on paper: asparagus tempura, crispy fried squid with green chilli, wagyu beef, black cod with miso, and sushi etc.\nI am prepared to say, in defence of the place that anything that hasn't been well cooked is not usually my cup of Twinings, therefore, perhaps my comments could easily be put down to seeing too many people eat Sushi. Then again, being a person who likes consistency and good service, I do try to be objective. In that department I must say they really never came up to my standards.

I was young(er) back then, but I knew amazing food when I tasted it. My opinion of Zuma has changed only slightly in the past decade, swayed by occasional visits here and there. Either the food has become even better, or my adult senses have developed more attuned receptors.\nThe restaurant bills itself as serving 'contemporary Japanese cuisine', but for some odd reason the place itself always reminds me of Africa. A weirdly jolting contrast to make, but for me that's a positive. The tables and chairs are all chunky light-coloured wood, the walls bear matching panels, there are green potted plants peppering the dining area and the base of the bar is formed from uncut stone, like an organic boulder of granite that grew naturally at the heart of Raphael Street. These rustic elements are juxtaposed with a lot of glass and the suave cosmopolitan clientele. It is hard to find a table here in the evenings, booking is definitely recommended, while at lunch time you may be asked to wait on busy days.\nThis was the case the other day, but we made it back to find the largest table in the place ready for the three of us. We weren't positioned in the main dining area, but from my seat I had a clear view of the kitchen, aromas and all.\nWe ordered the Crispy Fried Squid with Green Chili and Salt - hands down the best crispy fried squid I've ever had. Not only in taste and texture, but also in its consistent excellence (I always order it). The batter is light enough to taste the squid underneath and fine enough to form an irresistible crunch. The seasoning is sublime. It tasted so good but I was unsure about exactly which ingredient was doing all the flavoursome work. Upon asking the waiter, I was told that the fried squid is tossed with shichimi pepper, a Japanese mix of anything from red chilli pepper, Sichuan pepper, ground ginger, black and white sesame seeds and even roasted orange or Yuzu peel. A juicy squeeze of lime and I'm telling you it's perfect (we ordered a second round).\nWe also ordered the Yellowtail Sashimi in Ponzu Sauce with Crispy Garlic. The fish is soft and supple, while the flavours are strong and refreshing.\nThe Thinly Sliced Seabass with Yuzu, Truffle Oil and Salmon Roe was equally fantastic, with that distinctly appetising scent of truffle emanating from the plate as soon as it arrives to your table. Again, the fish is of the highest quality and so each piece melts in your mouth. Each slice is so delicate and dainty but altogether the dishes accumulate to ensure you are full in the nicest of ways.\nAn absolute favourite of mine is the Aubergine with Miso Paste, which probably pips Chutney Mary to the crown for best aubergine small dish in London. I will also definitely be re-ordering the new-ish Mackerel Roll wrapped in thin slices of cucumber for the delicacy and freshness of its ingredients. It's a roll without rice, which makes it lighter and more refined to taste, so that you really enjoy the soft mackerel meat and the contrasting crunch of the cucumber. It is served marinating in a dish of pickle juice, which adds a subtle tangy flavour. Such a fine and enjoyable dish.\nTwo other delicious rolls are the Dynamite Spider Roll and the Salmon and Avacado inside out roll. The former comes stuffed with tempura soft-shell crab and a dab of chilli mayonnaise on top, adding a luxury hint of creamy spice to the crispy interior - another must-have dish.\nI haven't really come across a non must-have here, and I look forward to returning again and again over the next decade to sample even more of their dishes and try something from the Robata grill. Presentation, service, decor, food - it's all cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. Zuma is the place to go to for exquisite food and a buzzing ambiance. Expect to have to book, to pay the price for the quality, the name and the location - then nothing can disappoint you. Just enjoy."}, "450": {"rating": 2, "review": "This place is a bit pretentious and overpriced for the quality of food.  I remember being thoroughly disappointed by the food.  The place is great for the atmosphere and people watching."}, "451": {"rating": 3, "review": "Dear London: if this is the best Japanese you have to offer, New York totally owns you in this category (as well as some joints in California as well). That's not to say that the food wasn't good here - it was definitely above average - but given the exorbitant cost of food here in the UK, you have to live up to some pretty high standards to make the cut...and I've been to places in NYC that cost less than half of what I paid tonight that was a better overall epicurean experience than this was.\nWe did the omakase because...well, you figure you're going to get the best the restaurant has to offer. Courses often came out two at a time, which was nice because it meant we weren't waiting for the food to come out. The first two courses were very delicious - tuna tartare on a rice cracker and the sea bass in truffle oil. The former is something that is very simple but works well, as most of the tuna tartare I have had is plain. This was lightly seasoned and had very thin cuts of scallion with it, adding a nice little twist. The truffle oil on the sea bass was a revelation (it's not something I've had anywhere else); the mushroom-infused marinade worked very well on the sea bass, and the side of ikura worked well to add a touch of saltiness to the platter. The other fantastic dish was the tempura-style langoustine with a vinegar-based dipping sauce. Regular tempura is akin to beer battered fried food, but this was done very lightly instead, with the crispiness looking more like fuzzy threads coming off of it...but it works because it doesn't dominate the dish and allows for the langoustine's flavor to come through. The black cod wrapped in banana leaves (or was it lotus?) was done well for a fairly standard Asian dish; I liked the accompanying citrus dip that took the edge off the heavily baked-in miso marinade.\nThat said, I took issue with a couple of the main dishes that were served: the wagyu beef and (very unfortunately, since this is crucial to a good restaurant) the sushi/sashimi combo. I've had amazing beef at shabu-shabu and cooked over a stone, and that is delicious. This beef was clearly cooked as a full filet and then subsequently cut up...as such, instead of all of the pieces being a tender medium-rare, a quarter of them (towards the ends, and even some in the middle) were closer to medium-well and well-done - definitely not the aspired result. The accompanying sauces were banal - a standard sesame-soy dipping sauce and a mayo-based dipping sauce that didn't have that needed kick. The sushi was disappointing because we got all of 2(!) pieces, and one of them (the yellowtail) was probably the worst quality I've had at a high-end Japanese shop. The other (a piece of aburi sushi) was absolutely delicious, which makes me wonder why there's so much inconsistency. The sashimi was equally inconsistent: the semi-fatty tuna was very good, and the mackarel was on the better end of what I usually get in this fish, but the rest was unmemorable: the sea bass was way too chewy, the salmon didn't have that fresh buttery taste or deep flavor you get from the truly fresh stuff, and the grouper (with some kind of vinegar jam on top) was bland. Bland ain't grand; it's forgettable.\nDessert was a bit on the large side (six dishes served in a huge bowl of ice; Zuma does like serving lots of its dishes on ice) and was a microcosm of the inconsistency of the main course. The best was the chocolate lava cake filled with chocolate caramel; this was absolutely delicious, with the caramel adding a nice layer of flavor to a dish that is usually chocolate on top of (and inside of chocolate). The banana cake with regular caramel was also quite tasty, although it tasted a little too much like banana bread with caramel syrup added to it. The coconut pudding with fresh fruit was tasty, but the problem here is that the consistency of the pudding was different: it was quite thin (almost liquid-like) at the top, but quite a bit more viscous at the bottom. As for the ice creams served, the vanilla was bland (I think someone forgot to add sugar or anything that would make it sweet), the green tea was green tea (i.e. unexciting without being paired with anything else, like red beans), and the coconut was the best, but the flavor of the fruit was muted (probably the same deal as with the vanilla).\nService was pretty decent, but for 96 pounds a person + 20%(!) tax + 15% 'optional' gratuity (why is it called optional when every place I've been to adds it automatically?) + 4 pounds for edamame (the most expensive edamame I've had, and not noticeably different at all) + 4.50 pounds for flat water(!!!), I could've spent the money better elsewhere. The food was alright, but if I did come back, I would save money by picking individual dishes instead of going with the tasting menu. Pick the dishes that are good, and not only will you not be disappointed, your wallet will feel better as well. That's what I call a win-win."}, "452": {"rating": 5, "review": "This is one of London's most well-known restaurants and a favourite for work dinners, nestled off the main street of Knightsbridge and buzzing with a trendy bar and delicious modern Japanese plates meant for sharing. We ordered a selection of plates for 5 people, but didn't get sushi except for a sashimi platter and instead went heavy on the cooked meat. Some takeaways: the spicy edamame much better than plain edamame (wasn't too spicy, but very good flavour), the aubergine dish was quite nice, but the creamed spinach was missable. As for the seafood, the crispy fried squid was good but nothing spectacular, and same for prawn tempura, whilst the sashimi selection was very enjoyable and well presented.  And the meat was the highlight, especially the grilled pork skewer and the seared steak. The chicken wings were tasty but had very little meat, and a pain to eat because it's nearly impossible to eat with chopsticks. I also had a watermelon martini that they are famous for, and I highly recommend it. The service was mediocre, as we had to ask a number of times to get forks, initial drinks, and drink refills. But overall a great experience and I completely understand its continued popularity."}, "453": {"rating": 5, "review": "Oh my word. \nSo, a little bit of context. We were in town for a few days and, being Japanese and having lived in the Middle East for far too long, I really wanted good Japanese food. We scoured Yelp reviews, TripAdvisor reviews, Time Out reviews for hours until I saw a couple of Asian reviews for Zuma and figured ok, let's give this one a shot (I'm sorry, white folks, I love you but you don't know sh*t about Japanese food). \nIn fact, we vetted Zuma for so long that we timed ourselves right out of a reservation! Our concierge mentioned that we might be able to get a seat at the sushi bar if we went at around 7 pm, so what did we do? We waltzed in at 9 pm on a Saturday night. Well, long story short, although they told us we could get a seat at 10:45 (at which point we had a brief and intense discussion about how badly we wanted this food; conclusion: pretty badly), we went for drinks, came back, and got seats promptly at 10. Not bad. \nWe had a hilarious waiter, who was not shy about telling us exactly what we should order. In most cases, we took his suggestion, and were not sorry that we did. In our normal ridiculous fashion, we ordered a ton of food:\nThinly sliced hamachi (like carpaccio) with green chili and garlic\nSeared tuna with chili daikon and ponzu\nSea bream, chu toro (semi-fatty tuna), salmon sashimi\nWagyu sushi (let me just take a moment to add that my boyfriend was talking to me as I put the first bite in my mouth, and had to stop for a full two minutes because I was definitely no longer paying attention--this is easily one of the best things I've ever had)\nUnagi nigiri\nLobster sashimi (oh lord, so good)\nGrilled jumbo tiger prawns (when this came to the table, it was so large I thought it was the lobster)\nRoast lobster (this was actually a mistake; the waiter heard roast and we meant raw, but we took it anyway. Very good but a tiny bit too heavily spiced)\nAnd then, when I thought I could take no more, they came with a plate of chicken yakitori on the house--I actually begged them not to give it to us because I was so full, but they put it in front of me and of course I ate it. After, the waiter blessedly came by with some green tea, winked at me, and said, \"Good for digestion.\" Good thing he did, because I might not have been able to walk out of there.\nNo, it's not Japan. The fish, while incredibly, unbelievably fresh, is still not as good as what you can get in Japan. But that's like saying that you don't like your Riedel wine glass because it's not the holy grail. \nNext time, I'd like to try the tempura, which looked slightly too heavy on the batter but otherwise good and some of the other grill dishes. We will definitely be going back. Oh, and one other thing: they have fresh wasabi.

It is part of a small world wide chain with subsidiaries in Hong kong, Istanbul, Miami and Dubai. You might be able to get away with a semi-affordable bill when ordering carefully, but in the end you will want to splash out. Zuma invites to decadence and gluttony, and at this night, for my birthday, I was part of it.\n In London, Zuma is located in a very ugly building not far from Knightsbridge tube station and doesn't look like much from the outside. When you enter it however, you feel like you have stepped into a night club or into one of these bars I never go to because I refuse to pay 15 pounds for a cocktail and I usually don't confirm with the dress code.\n Surrounded by the young, rich and stylish I was glad I had dressed up for this special occasion feeling like a real Chelsea girl, wearing something rather short together with very high heels in the form of my almost virgin golden Sergio Rossi stilettos. Sipping my Saffron and Poppy Seed Martini (10.50) I was waiting to be spoiled.\n I really liked Zuma, in fact I liked it about 1 million times more than the only other posh Japanese restaurant I have been to in London, Nobu Berkley Square.\n LIKE\n 1. Lovely staff: Even though we didn't have a reservation the lovely people at the counter found us a place at the sushi bar within 10 minutes. Friendly and forthcoming they had nothing in common with the pretentious waiters at Nobu.\n2. The menu: I liked the fact that in addition to some astronomically priced dishes they do have a good selection of dishes costing less than 10 pounds.\n3. The wine: There are also quite some wines for under 20 pounds, which allows you to maybe order a couple of dishes more\n4. The food (see below) was sublime. I loved the fresh and exquisite ingredients, the exotic and well-balanced sauces and the inventive take on Japanese food without losing the traditional touch.\n DISLIKE\n 1. I really wanted some cold sake to go with my Japanese delicacies, but they were out of the two cheapest sakes! (19\u00a3 and 29\u00a3 respectively for 300 ml). We did not go with the next expensive one (40\u00a3) but had wine instead. Wanted sake though!\n 2. The Sushi Counter: the person who designed this should lose his/her licence really. The broad stone surface gives you plenty of space for all your plates but underneath  this is a completely different story. Even I with my 5.3 ft had no idea what to do with my legs. Not only was there absolutely no space, the inside surface of the counter was ragged, which not only destroys stockings but also hurts! This reminded me of the story that I once heard about McDonalds, where they intentionally use tilted chairs so that the customer does not feel to comfortable and doesn't want to linger. I wonder if similar incentives were in the mind also of the people behind the Zuma interior design?\n3. Why don't they put prices on their website? I really don't like this, people should know what they are in for. And while I'm at it, did I mention that I HATE websites with music?\n Anyway, the most important thing is the food, here we go:\n Suzuki no osashimi (12.60)  thinly sliced seabass with yuzu, salmon roe and truffle oil  one of my favourite dishes\n Tokodai wafu asperagasu (5.80)  beautiful fresh and with delicious wafu sauce and sesame on top.\n Shitaki Mushrooms (4.80)  tender and garlicky this was a rather generous portion for not quite 5 pounds.\n Chicken Yakitori (5.80)\n Yellow Tail sashimi (8.00)  boring compared to the other dishes.\n Unagi Nigri (8.80) however, was all the better.\n Aubergine (8.60) something\n Inaniwa Langustine Noodles (14.80)  this was one of the specials, the chilled noodles with the sweet langoustine and the ripe mango were very pleasant indeed.\n Wagyu Beef Sushi with Black Truffle (27.50)  loved the raw beef melting in my mouth together with the subtle truffle flavour. Expensive but worth it :)\n Banana and Green Tea Cake with Peanut Toffee Sauce and coconut ice cream (8.80)  weird combination but worked somehow.

In the nearby listings, something crept up to the top. It had 5 stars. Out of 5. This was the average from 35 reviews. I figured Hey, this has got to be good! And proposed it to the boys. A few seconds of umms and errs quickly morphed to us all walking over round the small lancelot street to get to raphael street where Zuma hides. As we turned the corner, it looked like we might have gotten lost in an alley. Then we got to the doorway. Golden light streaked out, warming the stone that lined the walls. We walked into the warmth, spotting the beautiful hostesses who were welcoming despite our lack of reservation. We could be seated at 20:00, she said. It was 18:30. I turned to my friends and explained (in french) we'd have to wait for an hour and a half. We all shrugged. And raised eyebrows when the hostess continued our conversation in fluent French. A nice touch. We spent a very happy hour and a half at the rather crowded bar, where we watched lovely waiters handle bottles in ways you didn't think bottles could be handled, pouring double or triple beers one-handed, and generally shaking and stirring things up like nobody's business. I had a kiwi bellini. I think. Not that it matters. It was delicious, layered in flavours, and generally to be had again, and again, and again. Well, maybe one again short of that, given the \u00a312 price tag At 20:00 sharp (I was very impressed with the timeliness) we were seated. Mesmerised by the sushi masters, it took us a while before we opened the menus and drooled over the contents. Ordering was quick and painless, the food arriving incredibly quickly. We shared all dishes, being mediterranean. And frankly it's the style of the place. Every single one of them was SO delicious! A complete symphony. The sweet, the tangy, the spicy, the crunchy, the smooth melt-in-your-mouth salmon teriyaki, crunchy spicy fresh and perfect calamari. So perfect, in fact, we ordered another later on and when the kitchen somehow lost track and made a third, our waiter brought it to us, laughing, saying he was sure we'd appreciate it more than anyone else. We did. We SO did! At the end, you had to roll us out from the food we ate. And we had wine. Given our bill came in at under \u00a3100 for each of us, with the wine, and we were quite stuffed with the most delicious food we had every had (well, the best seafood, that's for sure), we thought it was an absolute bargain! We'd all go again at the drop of a hat, should anyone find a good enough excuse. Or a poor one. Any excuse, really. I just want to have my eyes roll back and my mouth be stunned at the delicious melting softness of that salmon teriyaki. Truly. You have GOT to eat there. Even if all you can afford is one dish.

In the summer the restaurant tends to get quite hot and humid if you need to sit more deeper inside the restaurant, I recommend trying to get a table near the entrance during the summer. The restaurant appearance of the restaurant is dated and would benefit from a refresh such as making all the walls more brighter and the tables/chairs being updated. The toilet is downstairs that could also do with the same treatment as it's quite dark the locks on the doors aren't strong/stable\nStaff: The are generally friendly, some more talkative than others, but always at least polite.

Also, all of the rice comes with a side salad which is AWESOME and wow...their cherry tomatoes? Only one, but so refreshing and awesome from all of the heavy comfort food. Nice touch. \nOkay, so you definitely can't beat value. Taste wise, it is also super good. Their wasabi is really weak though, which surprised me. But, that's pretty minor. I probably wouldn't recommend ordering the Zaru Soba (\u00a35.00) since it isn't really filling but it's a solid tasting dish (dipping sauce could be better). Tori Teriyaki Rice was REALLY good though, their chicken is crisp on the outside and super moist and juicy on the inside. They cook their chicken really well! The teriyaki sauce was also fantastic, just enough sauce and subtly sweet. Same goes for the Tori Karaage, which was battered perfectly! Outside had a nice crunch and was crisp while the inside still remained juicy and succulent. The rice is also amazing too, like it's nice and sticky and short grained!!! Great texture and taste, it is seriously some good rice. Tonkatsu Curry was  pretty good, but the meat itself was lean at parts. But when you eat the fatty parts...YUM. It was nicely battered and crisp with your standard curry, which was pretty good. I wish they gave you more curry though, since portions are massive LOL. Food tastes essentially like japanese comfort food, and everything is really well cooked! You really can't beat the price and the quality of the food.\nPortions are bigger than a human head and you will definitely be full and happy here! They don't skimp on ingredients and the food is really well cooked, despite how constantly busy this place is! There's always lines at your standard dinner/lunch time so if you're not looking to wait, try to come a little later or earlier than the typical meal time. However, the wait wouldn't be really long and they're super efficient and quick. Their take out is also fantastic, great packaging (they use plastic tupperwares and it pleases me greatly) and portions still!!! Anytime I'm in London and hungry, this is the place I ALWAYS go to. I brought my friend from Nagoya to eat here and she loved it and I quote, \"it tastes like I'm eating real Japanese food back in Japan!\".

Put off by the horrendous airport check-in queue, we decided to head to Chinatown at her request to try a small Japanese place she'd heard good things about.\nThus we found ourselves at Misato, a tiny Japanese cafe looking place with nary any indication it was a shop, apart from the A4 piece of paper in the window showing the name of the place. This in no way hinted how amazing the food would be once inside.\nThere was a small queue when we arrived, around 8-10 people and seeing the size of the place, we expected to have to wait ages. Luckily!, as we arrived, a table opened up for 2 people and we were shooed right in. So get this, if you want a table quickly, go in small groups of 2. Otherwise like the unfortunate people with 3 or more in their party, there is a long wait due to the limited number of group tables. As we ate during that 45 mins, the queue only got LONGER.\nThe food itself is brilliant on two levels. First, the value for money is astounding. The Unagi Nigiri (That's the Sushi wraped in Eel) which is normally a little pricy in other places was \u00a32 for 2 pieces of reasonable size. 6 pieces of sushi ranges from \u00a33-6 from California rolls to salmon. My jaw dropped. Not to mention the main dishes were served in giant portions for \u00a34-9. Katsu curry, Bento boxes...I cannot fault the value here.\nSo a place that does cheap sushi probably tastes cheap too right? Wrong. I've eaten in quite a few sushi places of varying quality and I can honestly say this place serves the most tasty sushi in the whole of london. It wasn't bland, dry, nor too cold, plus had the right amount of vinegar in the rice, good amounts of filling and the Unagi Nigiri was so succulent...and the california rolls to die for. I just don't know how they do it. \nMy main arrived, the Chicken Teriyaki and again, lettuce smothered in delicious mayonaise (I think Kewpie) a mass of real breaded chicken, big rice portion and again, delcious Teriyaki sauce. I'm just salivating thinking about this meal.\nFor sure I'll be back, and will be in a group smaller that too. I mean the important thing is that I get in. And once in, I shall feast like a king on a budget.\nSeriously, if you're in Chinatown and in a small group. At the risk of making this place even more popular that it already is, consider Japanese. Consider Misato.

Thankfully we only had to wait about 5-10 minutes before being seated. They also hand you the menus to look over in line, so we ordered pretty much right after we got seated. I wanted something light so I ordered the Tofu Steak (grilled tofu & sauce, w/ salad) and asked for the salad dressing on the side. When the dish came out I was already a bit disappointed. Not to be picky, but they didn't remember to put the dressing on the side. Ok, fine. Whatever. Maybe the dressing will actually taste good? Unfortunately not the case, as it tasted super watery. The dish also came with a mysterious brown sauce (which I assume was for the tofu). Curious, I dipped my chopsticks in and gave it a taste. It literally tasted like diluted soy sauce. Not a fan. By this point I had pretty much given up, so I was actually pleasantly surprised when I tasted the grilled tofu since it was decent, although - again, this seems like a trend but - watery. Nothing special to say about the salad either - I mean, what can you really say about lettuce and a tomato?\nOverall I was not impressed. The service was fast and I appreciated that they constantly made sure our water glasses were filled, but honestly the food was so subpar I can't even justify the incredibly low prices (mine was 4 pounds).

I ordered sashimi. The salmon wasn't bad but the tuna was. It felt like someone had defrosted it. My friend ordered tonkatsu rice...\nNow imagine, if you will, that there exists a planet beyond our solar system made entirely of eggs. Suppose the inhabitants crafted a ship and landed it on your tonkatsu. That's what happened. A huge UFO of an egg was plopped onto the tonkatsu.

What I got instead was a confusing derivative loosely based on Japanese food.\nOur party of three overzealously ordered enough food to feed five people from the lackadaisical staff who only acknowledged us when we drew their attention. The portions were quite generous, despite the fact that half of the large plates were taken up by shredded lettuce slathered in dressing. \nThe katsudon with its bland, overcooked egg, lacked any type of onions, was not cooked with the pork cutlet and was served on a plate instead of a bowl (the \"don\" in \"katsudon\").\nThe katsu curry was edible, but the pork was dry and the curry sauce was quite sour and definitely not the same slightly sweet flavour of a Japanese style curry.\nThe pork and ginger rice dish was passable, approximating the flavour of the sauce well, but the preparation of the pork seemed very lazy. The slices of meat were far too thick and rigid.\nPerhaps the most offending item was the tori karaage, which was a disastrous, soggy, greasy mess of overcooked meat.\nFortunately there were several dishes that helped save the experience. The tempura was acceptable and the tofu steak was enjoyable, though you have to question the difficulty of lightly frying a piece of tofu.\nPerhaps I am being a little harsh, as the generous portions meant that we all left with very full stomachs, and this kind of food is perfect for a quick, cheap and filling meal for lunch.

However, I jumped in and opted for the Tempura with rice. whilst Crystal opted for the Katsu with egg sauce. \nTempura was standard and for the price, decent enough. What caught my attention though was the egg sauce on the Katsu. Firstly, egg sauce just sounds wrong and this wobbly, semi solid 'mess' looked absolutely rank if I'm being honest. I eventually plucked up the courage to sample a bit of the gelatinous, globby gloop and to my surprise, if you can get over the weirdness of, it's actually pretty tasty. \nService was quick and efficient and the lychee juice was the perfect option for a sticky evening. \nBill came to just under \u00a320 for a giant meal and drinks (1 beer, 1 lychee juice) and yes, I'd def go there again for something cheap, casual and easy (sounds a bit like a description of some tacky pick-up joint...)"}, "656": {"rating": 4, "review": "If you like Wagamama and fancy bigger portions for a lower price then Misato is the place for you. Having said that, apart from the menu, the two couldn't be any more different.\n Misato is a tiny little Japanese restaurant, only slightly longer than it is wide, hidden away on Whitcomb St, right next to Leicester Square. It is instantly recognisable in that there is nearly always a queue which often stretches out onto the pavement, past the shop front and blocking the doors of its neighbours. If you weren't looking for it, you'd miss it.\n The menu is varied, from sushi and bento to katsu curry, and it all looks great. The portions are big and unless you're very hungry you're unlikely to polish off a whole curry as the volume is simply overwhelming. Some of the dishes are a little too salty for me but for the price you pay, which can be as low as \u00a35-6 a plate, it doesn't hurt much.\n The staff are great, but unless you go when it is a bit quieter, it can occasionally feel like they are rushing you out to get the next customers in, and with the restaurant seating maybe only 40 at a time, it can take a while to get to the front of the queue, but I would advise anyone to stick it out.\n My only other criticism is that it does get very hot in there sometimes due to the lack of air conditioning, but hey, good food, cheap and cheerful with a great atmosphere.

All the portions are big no matter what you order and the price of a main course ranges from \u00a36 for a large rice-based main course to just under \u00a39 for a big bento box. And all this just a stone's throw from Leicester Square where everything is poor quality and overpriced!\nSo you arrive, and size up the queue. It'll take about 25 minutes to get inside.

The menu has a trademark salad and I always wonder to myself, how do they concoct such a tasty salad cr\u00e8me? What's the recipe ? Give it to me! Another bonus is the price that is as cheap as \u00a36.50 which is a bargain considering how large the plates are for such quality foods. You definitely get your moneys worth here as well as your traditional Japanese cooking. What I would suggest is to avoid the busy hours and come in advance such as 1pm or 5pm.

When you order theyre not attentive, the waitress today didnt have the common sense to think that as there were 2 of us that wed both want drinks, so several minutes after my partner got his drink, I brought this issue to her attention and she just rolled her eyes, didnt apologise and then just dumped the drink infront of me. Then when my partner had just about finished his meal the waitress quickly grabbed his plate away before he barely had the chance to put his chopsticks down! Keep in mind this wasnt peak time, it was mid afternoon and there wasnt the usual long queue and lack of seats. Then to top it all off, when the bill came the waitress gave us the wrong change and when we approached her about it she just slapped it onto my hand, again no apology, no thank you, no goodbye etc etc. If the staff were somewhat nice then I may have just left them the 5 Pounds as a tip but theyre not even worthy of 1p!!!

Hands down. \nSketch was worth every single penny. During my recent trip to London, me and my girls knew that we had to have high tea. It was almost my birthday and my friend had recently just gotten a promotion, so we were in the mood to spend $$ and celebrate. Enter Sketch. \nSketch has 5 different dining rooms, each with their own \"special\" experience and theme. Room 1: The Glade - Enchanted forest themed, specializing in lunch and cocktails. Room 2: The Gallery - Brasserie/All Pink Everything, specializing in afternoon high tea and dinner. Room 3: The Parlour, specializing in all day dining + live music and cocktails, Room 4: The Lecture Room - a Michelin star restaurant, specializing in lunch and dinner menus. Room 5: The East Bar/Pods/Bathrooms - a small modern space themed bar, also the bathrooms. \nWe dined in Room 2: The Gallery for high tea. Immediately upon walking in you're taken aback by the beautiful pink decor and cute watercolour art on the walls. There are servers walking around in different uniforms, each with their own specific duty - \"caviar man\", \"tea expert\", and \"champagne lady\" to name a few. \nOur tea lady/main server came by and explained the menu to us. She asked if we wanted to upgrade our teas to a champagne tasting, and at that point, we said \"sure, why not?\". And so we upgraded. \nFor teas, they had a large selection of delicious teas from around the globe. Along with the champage, we each got our own pot of tea. I sampled two different ones: a Sri Lankan Earl Grey and an Indian Chai. To be honest, I can't pick between the two. Both were the best teas I've ever tried. No joke. Added a little bit of milk and sugar to them and was truly blown away. And to think this was just the teas. \nOn to my favourite part: the food. First, we had an appetizer: sea salt and butter breadsticks with caviar and quail eggs. I have never had caviar before, but I have to say, I was impressed. I see why people eat this stuff all the time. Paired with the creamy quail egg and breadsticks, I was in foodie heaven. Second, the mains: unlimited finger sandwiches, cakes, and treats. I can't even remember everything that was there, but I do know that I love everything that I tried. My two favourites: the curried chicken sandwich and the salmon and cream cheese roll. I had to get more of these because I loved them so much. I have much more of a savoury palette than sweet, so I preferred all the sandwiches to the cakes. But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the cakes. The blueberry cake was my favourite! At this point we were so full and we had completely forgotten that we had a third course: scones and more cakes. We all opted for the plain scones, paired with butter and your choice of strawberry or plum jam. I'm not the biggest fan of jam, so I just stuck to the good ol' butter. I wish I had more room for this because it was SO good. \nOne of my favourite parts about this experience? The bathrooms. You go through a pair of doors and up the stairs. When you look up the ceiling is covered in neon-coloured square lights. The bathrooms itself... are eggs pods. With each egg pod being one bathroom stall. Truly one of the best (and fanciest) peeing experiences I've had to date. \nAll in all, I loved every single minute of dining at Sketch. Everything from the attention to detail to the beautiful decor, to the delicious food and presentation to the classical band playing classic tunes, everything was absolutely perfect and now no other high tea experience will ever compare. \nPS: Make a reservation because this place books up months in advance!"}, "709": {"rating": 5, "review": "After seeing this restaurant on Instagram, my girlfriend and I decided to make a reservation here a couple of days before our stay in London. Once we read reviews off here, we decided to go with Afternoon Tea at the Gallery. \nVisually, the space is beautiful. Upon entering, it's dark, quiet, and you'd never guess that the inside of this restaurant has whimsical themed rooms inside of it. Inside the Gallery, the walls are full of art, placed upon pink walls. Pretty much everything in the room was pink, but it wasn't anything overwhelming. The waiters and waitresses were dressed in suits and costumes while a couple of violinists played every few minutes. Of course, you'd have to visit the washroom - it'll likely be the most interesting one you'll ever visit. The ambiance of the restaurant was busy, but enjoyable. \nIn terms of the food, it was pretty decent. We went with the cheapest option possible, giving us endless amounts of tea. We both opted for matcha and chai tea, which you can't go wrong with. What I didn't know is that if you enjoyed any of the cakes or sandwiches, you could ask for more at no cost. I was delighted to find this out because I assumed that I'd only be given the portions given initially! When looking at photos of the food from reviews, I thought I would be hungry leaving, due to the portion sizing. I can tell you that I left full, and satisfied. \nIf you're interested in eating at Sketch, I would definitely recommended having Afternoon Tea at The Gallery.

The host and hostess there were kind and were accommodating where possible. Second time around we were able to grab a quick bite in the forrest themed side of the cafe and really appreciate it.\nSketch has two rooms, one being the renowned pink room, the other being what I call the Alice and Wonderland themed room, both are extraordinary! We visited between 3pm-5pm when they offer afternoon specials. We ordered two sets of combos, one with regular cones and the other with sandwiches. The first came with tea but the second did not. In terms of tea, we had rose and earl grey, both were phenomenal. Rose was lighter than earl grey of course, which was perfect for me since I don't usually drink tea. It was refreshing and we asked for additional hot water to reuse the paddles and tea pouch. \nSandwiches were unique as well. The four sandwiches were a mix of devil's egg, smoke salmon, cucumber, and curry. The small plate was filled with delicate creativity and the taste blended well. The cone on the other hand sounded like a standard afternoon tea side but was not nearly as impressive as the sandwich to me. The cone was a bit dry, though they provide a few fruit jams to go with it. Would certainly recommend the former combo than latter here.\nAtmosphere and service needless to say was impeccable. Really gave us a comfortable while also classy afternoon tea feel. The pricing was also affordable in my opinion for such an experience. We paid around $50 for two people but were able to try a number of delicates while spending quantity and quality time with gourmet decoration in the view.\nHighly recommend for anyone!"}, "713": {"rating": 5, "review": "I personally think this place was worth the money.

The place I found was Sketch and I couldn't wait to go.\nAt the entrance is a hopscotch so you can hop your way in, me being uncoordinated thought it best I keep both feet on the ground lol\nWe walked towards the hostess desk for the Gallery to be shown to our seat, and when we walked in the gallery, I knew this was going to be a great experience, beautifully chevron floor, lush velvety pink benches and chairs, white linen tablecloths, soft pink walls, funky hand painted art on the walls, it was everything I expected it to be but so much more, and that's just from walking into the room, the experience just kept getting better.\nService was impeccable, everyone looked sharp in their uniforms.\nWe did the afternoon tea for 58 pounds. It came with unlimited choices of teas, I wish I remembered the names of the teas, but I did try a vanilla tea and Darjeeling black tea (one of my favorites). \nThe afternoon tea comes with a lot, we started out with caviar and quail egg and cheese bread, next a beautifully presented tray came decked out with little finger sandwiches and sweets, everything was too pretty to eat, but don't worry, I did eat them. My favorites were the chicken and egg sandwiches. And we learned the sandwiches are unlimited, what? That's crazy!  Then we were treated to warm scones with fresh clotted cream and fig & strawberry jams. Is there anything better than a warm scone with fresh cream and jam? I think not!  But wait we are not done yet, but sadly we were full and asked if the dessert from the trolley could be packed up to go.\nEverything at Sketch exceeded my expectations, I truly was tickled pink by the entire experience.  Even the egg pod bathroom lived up to the Instagram hype."}, "720": {"rating": 3, "review": "I went here for the first time about a month ago.\nLOCATION: It's in Mayfair, which is a nice area of the city. 4/5\nATMOSPHERE: The ambience is amazing. We were in The Gallery (so I can only really speak for that), which is the most famous room of theirs (they have four main rooms). There's pink furniture and decor everywhere, and interesting/cool art on the walls. It's also very clean and pristine. I love it. Also, the iconic bathroom is super cool. So if you don't know about it, check it out if you go because it is an experience -- egg-shaped toilet stalls, colorful lights -- take an iconic mirror picture. So yeah, the atmosphere is definitely supreme. 4/5\nSELECTION: So we went during dinner time when they serve their \"a la Carte\" menu, and not their famous afternoon tea menu. So the menu is fairly small, but I do appreciate the few labeled vegan options. However, I wish there was more, or at least a better/more unique variety, rather than a salad, a soup-type dish, and a tofu dish. Also, I was going to order the salad, but was told that I couldn't unless at least one other person ordered it too, I guess? That was a bit of a disappointment, but I dealt with the soup-type dish -- more on that below. 3/5\nWHAT I GOT: I got their \"Green Le Puy lentils, button mushrooms, snow peas\" dish. It was basically like a soup. It comes out as a shallow bowl of lentils, mushrooms, and peas, but then they pour some sort of broth thing over it right in front of you. It was alright overall, but definitely not anything worth raving about. I liked that it wasn't oily or salt. And, the ingredients tasted fresh and good quality. But, it was very small and not filling. They make it seem like a bigger portion by serving it in a larger looking bowl, but it's actually super shallow, so it's literally like half a cup's worth. I know it's a nice, fancy dining establishment, but it's a ripoff to pay \u00a320 for no more than like half of cup of veggies. They should at least put like some grains in it or use a deeper bowl to make it more sustaining. That's my opinion on the dish. 3/5\nSERVICE: The staff seemed nice, but their service was kind of awkward. First off, when I went to the front desk to say that I had a reservation, the man said to wait five minutes and then come back to ask again. I came back five minutes later and still had to wait a bit, but then we were finally seated a few minutes later. Ok, so that wasn't too bad, but then it's confusing when you're seated because you have a waiter/waitress, and then a drink person to take drink orders. But, they don't really explain that. Anyways, after figuring that out, the waitress we had would either hover around our table or disappear throughout our dinner, which was strange. Or we'd be talking about the menu and she'd keep coming over, like asking if we had questions and whatnot a bunch. On to the drinks guy: one person I was with with ordered a Pimm's. Normally, you'd expect that when you order a Pimm's, you get the drink with the Pimm's, lemonade, and fruits. However, a glass of straight Pimm's, the straight liquor, came out. We tried Googling it, and found that the only thing it could be called was a Pimm's Cup, so we looked for someone who looked like they maybe knew about drinks better, and found a young guy. After explaining the situation and the different names and all that, he seemed to understand what we were expecting because about 5-10 minutes later it finally came out as expected ... I mean, whenever I've been to pubs and whatnot in the city, there were no questions asked, and a Pimm's comes out properly, with the lemonade and fruits mixed in. Maybe we're missing something and at nicer places you have to call them Pimm's Cups? Anyways, that was our experience with the staff/service.

My girlfriend had a carafe of wine, to be honest I don't know which one, but she enjoyed it none the less.\nFor appetizers, we had the white asparagus which was pretty good. The best part was the herb veloute sauce it came in. We also had the Potato and Thyme bread which was yummy as well.\nFor dinner, I had the Aubergine and black garlic tortellini. It was delicious! The baby aubergine and zucchini that accompanied the tortellini were delicious. My girlfriend had the Veal Milanese and a side of mashed potatoes. I tried a bite of the veal which was tasty, but the mashed potatoes were dry and I thought I would choke trying to swallow them. \nOverall, I'm glad we came here.

The waiter never came to check on us, only to serve us our different courses. He also forgot to bring the additional food that I had requested (I ended up being full by the end so gave up on asking for it). It ended up being about 250 pounds for 2 people (quite pricy IMO).

I didn't ask them to do this; but when they came out with the food they clearly explained the substitute sandwiches and even put cauliflower rice balls on a spoon so I could pretend to eat caviar. Cauliflower is not caviar, but it was a kind gesture! \nI'm not sure how much you can escalate tea sandwiches, but this level of the 3-tiered serving platter was the most enjoyable for me. The presentation was perfect, yet nothing really blew my mind. I liked that you could get more of the sandwiches that you liked best. The deserts were fabulous -- even if I found some of them too rich/sweet for my taste buds. I should have saved more room for the scones. If you have a sweet tooth, this is a MUST experience. \nYes, the bathroom was insane.

But this dining experience was literally SO far below our expectations that it was baffling. We only had a few days in London and we searched all over months in advance to make reservations at spots that seemed worthwhile to us. We thought it would be fun to dine in an art gallery after visiting the Tate Modern, and in that regard we were right. \nThe gallery atmosphere of sketch is absolutely mesmerizing, with not a single detail ignored. It features the witty and comical art of David Shrigley on the walls and within the dining fixtures themselves, brightly-colored pink chairs, and the famous toilet pods (which I'm convinced are a large reason for many of their visitors' 5-star reviews). The atmosphere is incredible and warranted at least 2 stars. But unfortunately the rest of our time at sketch fell flat. \nWe did the champagne afternoon tea, which we didn't realize only came with a single glass of champagne. That's fine, but based on the dramatic price increase we didn't realize that. (Maybe because we are heathens who normally drink cheaper champagne, but nonetheless it didn't feel worth the additional \u00a334 or whatever it was.) The three tiers of savories and sweets for the tea *looked* absolutely beautiful, but there were only a couple of items that actually wowed us with their flavor while the others seemed like whimsical placeholders that tasted dull and unimpressive. \nService was questionably slow and disjointed, which made no sense because we often saw wait staff just hanging around chatting with one another. We placed our tea order about an hour before we received it...long after our 3-tier snacks were consumed. This was frustrating. Flagging someone down was nearly impossible even though it was a Tuesday and the place was relatively empty. There was a live strings trio playing music that did NOT fit the vibe of the establishment at all. And that kind of helps to sum up our whole experience...I couldn't decide what vibe or what identity sketch was serving up to me, and I think somewhere with such a unique image should have a well-defined concept with background music that matches, service that is at least satisfactory, and food that blows you away. \n\u00a3300 later we were still hungry and largely unimpressed by the food and tea we had consumed.

We all had the tasting menu. Two of our party were very sick later that evening and the next day. The two people who were sick had nothing else to eat in common, and had only met that night, so it seems unlikely that anything else would have made them sick, other than the meal at Sketch. \nWe emailed the restaurant to make them aware that two in our party were sick and appear to have had food poisoning. They referred us to an independent consultant. That consultant asked what else we had eaten and if we had been to a doctor. As we noted earlier, both people had eaten other things, but not together, so it is extremely unlikely that it was anything but Sketch that made them sick. We made this point to the consultant. And noted that neither person went to a doctor for treatment. Though one of the people sick is a pharmacist. So she could clearly take care of herself. The independent consultant determined their investigation was inconclusive. Which is a disappointment. \nA restaurant of Sketch's caliber and reputation should take responsibility for its actions. We have no problem paying for a good meal. And the food was good and experience nice.  Other than their getting sick. But we don't want to pay to get sick.

The service was terrible; in fact, we were too polite to say anything, but the French guests next to our table walked up and demanded that the waiters attend to us, as they noticed how we were being ignored amidst the other guests. It was super bizarre, as we always bend over backwards to be nice to waitstaff, and were excited to be there. \nIt took 2 hours for one drink each as well as a few small foods (nuts, etc.). \nThe only thing that will have me return to this place is for a meal in the main dining room; I hope the second chance eradicates the bitter taste in my mouth."}, "770": {"rating": 4, "review": "Definitely a unique high tea experience to try at least once while in London. \nBefore my trip, I booked a reservation a few weeks in advance for Saturday afternoon tea.

The tea pot, cups and sugar bowl are amusing to read with random words or phrases and the pictures in the menu are quite cute.\nAfter a filling meal, it is a must to visit the iconic egg-shaped bathroom stalls - just be sure to walk up the correct staircase since there isn't a clear divider between the mens' and womens' stalls.\nThe service was quite slow, but very polite and courteous - a lot of the waitresses were speaking French too. What was also nice was that there was live music playing in the background from a female string trio. \nA little pricey experience since it is at least \u00a365 per person depending on which high tea option you select.

The chips that came with my fish tasted like they had been forgotten in the back of the freezer for the last decade. The couples on either side of my table were equally displeased. From my perspective Sketch is trying to offer too wide an array of food. They have British, French, and Italian items on their menu. I would suggest they simply pick one type of cuisine and stick with it. The waitress was lovely and I felt bad she had to endure the customers to my right berating her about how bad the food was. \nSo, if you have 40\u00a3 to spend on a subpar meal than you should absolutely go to Sketch and get a picture of yourself with their fabulous decor!"}, "772": {"rating": 5, "review": "Worth every penny.  4 rooms, all distinctly and unique in their own way.

The food featured cakes, warm scones, caviar, finger sandwiches (that were made vegetarian upon request). They had many types of teas and you could try them all if you so wished. The servers were highly knowledgable about all of their dishes and made the act of serving tables an art, rather than a job.The overall price per person was not cheap, but considering the service, the quality of the food, the abundance of dishes, the creative ambiance, and the wonderful afternoon, the price is well worth it!\nI recommend making reservations ahead of time.

The tea was prepared fabulously and savory bites were all extremely delicious, the custard cheese egg and the mushroom sandwich being my favorites.\nUnfortunately, the sweet bites were all too sugary for my palate and they kept coming.  I wish the savory hadn't been outweighed threefold by the cakes and sweets.  When it came time for our final gluttonous duo of desserts, it seems the staff had turned over and we were left without service for an unfortunate 45 minutes.  We were trying to flag down members of the staff but perhaps the lunch crew was intent on leaving or setting up for dinner service and kept busy-bodying past us.  By the time we had finally flagged someone down, our appetite was long quelled and we were late for our next rendezvous.

I had a great time, and despite my husband's initial above statement after being seated, I know he did too. \nI ordered the afternoon tea option that included the infused tea champagne (\u00a379) and he had the Exotic tea (\u00a378.) The glass of Earl Grey-infused champagne was really good, but sadly no refills -- though the tea and main course offerings are endless.\nWe're served a creamy (comte?) cheese with petite breadsticks to start. The cute dishes have words and phrases on them. \nI'm taking in the infamous pink room and began to see a pattern of funny characters, from the interesting wall drawings to the rest of the staff themselves. I'm feeling all 'Twin Peaks.' \nThere's this guy, see. Dressed in a ridiculous pink full tweed suit. He's their caviar mascot, it seems, handing you a scoop of their caviar for your plate before happily twirling off. Dr. Jacoby. Yes; he's like a young Dr. Jacoby. \nNext comes a guy that reminds me of the Giant from Twin Peaks, who would sometimes serve as well. We couldn't understand a thing he said, and you know: I felt like he knew it lol I know the gals next to us couldn't understand him. I'd like to think he was telling us clues 'the owls are not what they seem.' \nLater, I notice a patron across from me has his head unfortunately placed next to one of the drawings, and I can't help but get a picture of him. \nAnd then the main courses arrive! Curry chicken, cucumber, smoked salmon sandwiches at the base of the tiers. Above that, the Battenberg cake, chocolate caramel cake, pistachio Petit Choux, and at the tippy top, homemade marshmallows and rhubarb cheesecakes. It was good; I tasted all the desserts not finishing them. I'll say that I enjoyed the sandwiches more (the curry chicken was my favorite) so I ordered more of them.\nNext course are the scones, with clotted cream and jam (his favorite thing always.) And last is my favorite dessert, the Victorian Sponge cake. \nThere's a two-hour time limit to afternoon tea noted when you make your reservations, which I recommend doing as far in advance as possible. A notable thing to mention is that my husband loves tea. The variety is excellent here, and he ordered a few pots over the course of the meal. Two of the pots he had are from tea bricks (pu'er tea) and are normally \u00a325 each serving there, but you can have it during afternoon tea. I felt it tasted like dust and prefer the pu'er we have at home.\nOne last thing: I couldn't not talk about the RESTROOMS. It really capped off the experience of Sketch. Through the room's pink door, up the pristine white stairs (a bar is in middle of the floor) you'll find the restroom pods. Men's = left staircase; Women's = right staircase. The pods are placed in no particular order, and sinks are found along the walls -- hiding behind pods.

The display of the food is pretty so you will definitely get an \"insta\" pic, but the taste was subpar.

The price didn't matter because we were paying for an experience. It started off pleasant because we came at a time where it wasn't the peak hours. Once people started coming in the service became non existent. Funny, because there are tons of servers. For the price you expect better service. I do not understand how service people can be so snooty. It is always better to treat people kindly, rather than act like you'd rather be elsewhere. It took us 20 minutes to try and get the bill and we were sitting right in front of the bar where ALL the servers walk by. We hailed someone down and she just forgot, even though we are right in front of her.\nThe ambiance is different than the typical high tea. It's more modern and of course looking at the bathroom you can tell. The bathroom is co-ed - I say this because it does not have a wall to divide between male and female and you need to guess which side is which. Let me help you not guess. Follow the pink lights ladies and follow the blue light guys.\nThe food was presented beautifully. Of course you will always have favorites but of the many choices we only really liked two items.

All the way down to the bathrooms, this is easily one of the most entertaining places to dine in London. \nSketch was designed by a modern artist. Their are several different \"themed rooms\" you can dine in and like all of London, they operate heavily on reservations. I went for afternoon tea and sat in their most popular room...it's a \"whimsical gallery\" with a whole lot of pink. Their is no detail that goes unnoticed. The wall is covered in quirky art, the acoustics are perfect, pink and rose gold everywhere and the waitstaff dress like they're citizens from the hunger games universe. \nAnd I almost forgot...The Bathrooms. These are seriously from the future. Left is boys and right is girls but its' all the same room. You basically do your business in a space pod. Also, their are french maids hovering around cleaning up. Pretty immersive if you ask me.\nOkay, not to the dining. So it's expensive but you go for the whole experience. Afternoon Tea is 58\u00a3 a person. Most other fancy tea places were about 35\u00a3+ so it's really not that crazy of a price but know before you go.\nWhat you get: Unlimited tea, sandwiches and sweets. Go hungry but don't eat so much you ruin your day. I was very conscious of doing this since we had sites to see! All of the food is brought out on a beautiful desert tray. Personally, I liked the sandwiches more than the french inspired sweets. The sandwiches are amazing. And of course, the tea is great as well. If you're wanting to add a little extra you can pay a 20\u00a3 (ish) extra per person and get champagne added to the experience. They also have cocktails you can order a la carte. \nOverall one of the top three things I did on my recent trip across the pond."}, "800": {"rating": 5, "review": "It might be basic but I loved this place. #noshame\nAfter getting multiple recommendations to go here from my girlfriends and seeing the instagram photos on here....I knew I had to book a reservation to check it out.

The 'great room' of the establishment, with a bar of gilded gold, rose gold copper countertops and backsplash. Pink velour and leather seats. The gallery's perimeter walls are lined with whimsical and random black and white sketches. There is a trio,  or quintet (who counted?) playing Satie, and vaguely familiar music from car commercials and films. The parlour next door is another room from Alice in Wonderland. The walls are trees papier mach\u00e9d in layers so that you are staring at dimensional paper woodlands.\nFood: First, who knew tea sommeliers (masters) were a thing? We each selected a tea for our palates. The moods at the table were: Rose, Oolong and Green-all delightful. The dude from Great Expectations gave the condensed biography of our caviar: Russian sturgeon raised in Italy. These were ceremoniously served in mother of pearl spoons before the tea complements arrived in three tiered splendour. Then the tea cakes, scones, and sandwiches came in waves: chicken, salmon, tomato confit, duck eggs, cherry, pistachio and sponge. There was joy and also apricot cheesecake.\nTea accoutrements, the honey, sugar and such, came with clever witticisms marked on the pottery. \nService: Their attention to detail is demonstrably excellent. The only downside to dining was the 30 minute wait before our orders were taken. And yet. Five stars. We filled the time with ogling the egg pod shaped futuristic toilets.

My first initial thought when I walked into Sketch was: Wow, this place is huge! There are three rooms from what I saw when I walked into the doors: them being, the Gallery, The Parlour, and The Glade. The Gallery is where you can order \u00e0 la Carte, desserts, and its famous afternoon tea sets. The Parlour and The Glade are where breakfast and brunch are served. Even though Sketch is famous for its afternoon tea, I actually did not reserve seats to try the afternoon tea, but to try their brunch. Surprisingly, it was really tasty. \nWhen my friend and I looked at the menu, there were so many options and we wanted to try all of them because they all sound so good; however, of course we did not do so. We ended up ordering two main plates and one dessert: fish pie n\u00eemoise (\u00a317.00), grilled var salmon with dundee pinky sauce (\u00a321.00), and a victoria sponge cake (\u00a36.00). The fish in the fish pie n\u00eemoise was salmon and I thought the texture was kind of funny and interesting, but the dish was delicious! The salmon of the grilled var salmon with dundee pinky sauce dish was super juicy and well cooked. The dish I actually loved the most out of the three is actually the victoria sponge cake. It has raspberry jam and a few raspberries on the top of the sponge cake and a vanilla chantilly layer in between the sponge cakes. When I bit into it, I did not know what to expect because I was not too fond of raspberries. However, after trying that dessert, I immediately change my opinion on raspberries and I quite like them now. \nA downside of this restaurant is the service. Even though there were a lot of servers, we still had a hard time calling for them and had to do it a couple of times before they would come and take our order.

There's the main tea parlor, enrobed in rose petal pink, whose chairs look like ladyfingers and where you feel positively doted upon by all the servers. While you wait for your seat, you might have a drink at the spherical bar in the back, where seating goes around the perimeter and the ceiling is decorated with unconventional drawings. Their cocktails are good and not overly strong. The famous space-age egg bathrooms are above, and when you use one, a recording of a 1940s pilot speaking on the radio crackles through hidden speakers. Then you have the Glade, personally my favorite room, decorated like a woodland fairytale as if straight out of a Lorrain landscape. And upstairs, you find the trippy disco bathrooms that fascinate me even more than the egg bathrooms - a small, dark room filled with flashing, twinkling, revolving lights, accompanied with similarly twinkling music, that make you feel like you just walked into an acid trip. No matter what room you're in, you can be sure it'll be thoroughly decorated and every detail thought of.\nYou might think all the excess in decor is there to mask subpar food, but the thing is, afternoon tea more than holds its own here. For two people, you get a large three-tiered stand filled with delicate tea sandwiches of different flavors and several desserts as well. Is it the best food you've ever had? Resounding no, but it's still much better than you might expect for such an outwardly flashy place.

If I could go back every month, I would. But alas, I live in New York and we don't have a Sketch.\nIs it a wee bit overblown re its reputation? Probably. But I think the hype is well-deserved. You walk in and the hostesses at the front (who, by the way, are designated for that area) greet you and walk you to the next point after you give your name on the reservation (MAKE A RESERVATION). The next group of hostesses/host then lead you to your table in this giant pink, modern, artsy, chic room. There are giant pink couches and hilarious white/black prints all over the walls. You get seated and a new set of waiters come to take your order.\nIt's obviously a set menu for high tea, but you can add champagne options (which we did). The food and tea are refillable - we definitely overdid it on the refills, but HEY, it's vacation. Where do I even begin? The sandwiches are delicious and the various different kinds are great for a diverse palette. The desserts are also not too sweet and everything just looks amazing to accompany the great tastes. \nWhen you're there, don't be ashamed of taking a million and one pictures of the food, the decor, and the people you're with. \nTake a selfie in the strange pod-rainbow bathroom - everyone else is doing it, too.

Ascend the white staircase & feast your eyes on egg-shaped pods & colorful ceiling aka their co-ed bathrooms. One dining room -- a forest of teals & greens; another room -- pale pink & gold & ultra femme. \nApart from the adornments, Sketch offers very little in the way of an exquisite dinner. His sirloin was tough & flavorless. This isn't the place for a quality steak. As for my cheese plate, there were interesting bits & bobs such as a creamy brie & an accompanying green apple gel, but nothing screamed unique or amazing -- sadly, a stark difference to how Sketch's surroundings made me feel. \nMy advice to those curious & intrigued -- indulge in every online pic you can find of the restaurant, immerse yourself in the fun, artistic details...& then spend your pounds wisely by having dinner elsewhere.

The problem lies with the presentation of it all and the service. We opted for the champagne afternoon tea which came out to 108 USD per person with no additional add-ons.

We had to ask multiple times for more water, more tea, etc. and were never offered it, but always had to ask. Finally, the last \"course\" of the tea was a slice of cake, which our waitress first asked if we would like to split one piece -- a strange thing to ask when we are paying so much for the afternoon. Finally, it felt as though we were rushed out of the table. Again, afternoon tea is meant to be drawn out and to not feel rushed in the slightest, but before we were even done with our cake, without asking if we would like anymore tea or anything else, the check was brought.  We didn't feel as though we ourselves were eating or drinking quickly, and we actually tried to take our time, but they had us in and out in under two hours.

The tea selection seems not as special, just your run of the mill teas you can find anywhere rather than the rare & exotic flavors from our first time. The desserts were inedible, the only one eaten was the blueberry cheesecake, otherwise they were all artificially sweet with ZERO texture to them. Even the macaroon, shabbily stuffed with runny icing was left untouched. Overall everything had either a bland or too sweet taste.

Our first food offering was a small plate with slices of toast, a small serving of caviar and a ceramic egg with some kind of yummy cheese, my wife did not want the caviar and instead was offered a veggie version.  Next we were brought a 3 tiered tray of yummies, one tier of lovely finger sandwiches and 2 tiers of sweets, they were all quite delicious! They give you the option to order extra helpings of the food but be careful because there is plenty more to come! Next we were offered a choice of scones, with or without raisons, these were accompanied with wonderful clotted cream and 3 choices of jam. After the scones were were offered Victorian Sponge cake and Banana Toffee cake, the sponge cake was the winner as far as I was concerned.    We enjoyed 4 or 5 pots of different tea and they were all very nice. Overall it was a wonderful experience, the ambiance was very nice, the servers were very friendly and helpful. As wonderful as it was I would say it was a bit of a novelty, something that would be nice to do once a year or so. Be prepared to pay for the experience, this was not an inexpensive meal but to do it every once in a while it is well worth it. After a few pots of tea you will of course have to visit the toilet which are quite memorable at Sketch, they look like giant eggs or pods, I called them Disco Poo Pods for obvious reason, well obvious to me anyway.

We tried to read as much of the sketches/cartoons as possible. People literally come for egg pod toilets. Unisex and elevated on another level by the stair case, this place takes a bathroom experience to a whole new futuristic level. The elevated level felt like a nest for these eggs. I had some risotto that was covered in green sauce and mustard ice cream for dessert. All the flavors are dynamic and interesting. Not something you would find anywhere else.

We sit down,l and  no one came or offereds us water for 20 mins. I dont think you realize how long 20 mins is until you just sit there at a restaurant. It also took us 30 mins to get our bill.

If you want to eat here, go for it but I'm sure you will not want to come back. Our dinner was at 10:30pm by the way, so not during what would be considered \"dinner rush\" either. If this restaurant wants to keep repeat customers, you need to staff more wait staff to keep the tables turning. They're still basically full with the exception of a couple of tables so you should not have two or three waiters for the whole room. The decor is quite beautiful and you get pretty photos, but we all have Google for that now. Save yourselves $120 (for two people, we skipped apps as we were starving by the time they got us our water and cocktail menus).

Making a reservation was easy. I did mine online, got an email confirmation, and then also a phone confirmation the day before. \nUpon arrival, we were greeted outside of Sketch by a very polite gentleman who showed us inside. We asked to have a drink at the bar because we were early for our reservation. I had the Cable Car (I think that's what it was called) and it was delicious. It smelt strange because of the egg, but it was quite tasty and very flavorful. \nAfter I finished my drink, we went back out into the main hallway and were escorted through a roped off set of stairs up to the restaurant. The door was opened for us and our chairs pushed in at the table. We were seated in the room closest to the street. The chairs were incredibly comfortable and the ambiance was nice. It was quiet and nobody was ever very loud. I did feel like I had to speak more softly than normal, despite the distance across from my boyfriend being rather wide. \nI ordered the vegetarian tasting menu, while my boyfriend ordered the regular tasting menu. Both had the same amount of courses and the same timing, although mine was about 20-30 pounds cheaper. We were offered champagne but we declined. This was our first ever Michelin experience and we were very excited to start trying the food. \nEach course was mostly timed well. It gave us time to digest in between, although toward the end we were so full it became hard to finish the courses. Rather than go through every course we had, I'll just speak in generalities. \nBefore eating, I had expected that this would be one of the most flavorful and best meals of my life.  While the courses were indeed flavorful, none of them blew my mind. I hardly do fine dining, but I can still recognize amazing flavors and great taste. Most of the courses were good, but again, not life changing. My favorites were the asparagus ice cream/soup dish, goat cheese ravioli, strawberry dessert, and chocolate mousse (not sure what all was in it) dessert. My least favorite was the very dry pancake. All in all, I would rate the food about a 7/10 in taste, 8/10 in unique combinations and flavors, and 9/10 in presentation. \nService-wise, everything was great for the first 2.5 hours. Our waters were always filled (not free water btw), napkins folded when we left the table, doors opened for us on the way to the bathroom, courses explained (sometimes hard to understand the thinker French accents), and chairs pushed in for us. Around the 3 hour mark, our service began to decline. Some of the people who arrived after us and were on the same eating pace as us began getting their courses ahead of us. We waited quite a long time between the last course, the desserts, and the petit fours. \nAlso, after we were clearly finished with the final petit fours, we sat around and waited for 30-40 minutes to get our check. That really was the worst part of the evening, as it was nearing midnight and we were ready to leave. It's like everyone just checked out and forgot about us. We were the last to leave in our room, despite having finished our food at the same time as everyone else.  \nService for the first 60% of the dinner: 10/10. Service for the last 40%: 6/10. Should have been amazing the entire time. \nThe food was good, but nothing special. I probably wouldn't go again because nothing was very memorable or mind blowing as I had expected. Perhaps my expectations were too high for a Michelin experience, but I just wouldn't spend the money to eat here again.

So having scheduled to be in London for only 24-hours on my recent trip, I made the effort to book reservations at Sketch for quintessential afternoon tea. I made reservations online approximately three weeks in advanced and easily booked the designated time I had wanted for the Gallery (the pink room). \nAfternoon Tea is preset for person at \u00a336. It includes sandwiches, scones, and desserts, at minimum one piece of each item on the menu for the number of people at the table, and a pot tea of your choice. Any additional cocktails or champagne is outside of the set price.\nDon't under estimate the sandwiches and desserts! It's all very filling! The pesto panini is the only warm sandwich on the menu, so it's suggested that you eat it first. Service is oddly quick. The scones are wonderfully crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. The earl grey macarons are great too. My favorite sandwiches were the panini and the salmon with cream. If you happen to like more than the rest, you can ask for more! We sure did with the panini sandwiches. \nFor anyone booking late in the afternoon, tables have to be returned by 18:00. I had reserved a table for 16:30 and the hour and a half was easily enough time. Beware - there is a cancellation fee if you don't show up! Its just as much as afternoon tea per person(\u00a330)!!!"}, "899": {"rating": 5, "review": "I absolutely adore this place. When I walked in, I knew that was my type of place.

It's a fascinating gallery, but for high tea in particular, I don't want to pay 70 quid to look at art that a 10 year old could have made while constantly struggling to flag down my server.

Crank up your camera's ISO and you'll be fine. :D The service is impeccable; smiling and awfully polite staff as it should be. Soon after being seated I was informed that they were having a \"special\" afternoon tea event  (extra charge). I didn't really understand but didn't complain; I was just looking forward my treat. But I do recommend checking carefully before booking as the surcharge was substantial.\nTeas were delicious and you can chose from an interesting selection. The crockery fun and it's available to buy, if you can afford it. :) Usually the weakest part of an afternoon tea for me are the sandwiches, the same boring classics your nan would've put on your lunch box, often dried out bread + meagre fillings. Not here: the offerings are interesting, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. I was indeed very happy that they give you refills. The scones were nicely done, warm and the perfect texture; the cakes were more like desserts, not the classic slices you'd get at traditional places (and not the best part, in my opinion) but tasty enough and very well presented. thankfully not a tacky cupcake in sight here. \nIn the end we were offered one extra sweet and then finished our teas at leisure.

I actually had to do a double-take as she stood even taller than me, wearing 4-inch platform heels, cropped trousers, statement necklace, bright lips and a completely bald head. I had to stifle an embarrassing gasp as she stepped out of nowhere, almost android-like, and referred to her iPad. I was simultaneously relieved I'd made an effort with my own outfit and excited about seeing the rest of the place after this start.\nIt didn't let me down - we were seated in the outer garden-themed room by the bar, which was open and airy thanks to the skylight and decorated with leafy vines and greenery. It all felt a little Alice in Wonderland (though without a mad hatter in sight) as we sat on cutely mismatched garden furniture; I took my usual spot next to the bookshelf :)\nTea was delicious - though be warned it's heavily biased to sweet over savoury versus other teas in London. The sandwiches were fine but over quickly and it's two tiers of sweet tooth heaven from then on. The key component to impress me on is always the scones, which arrived separately and were fabulously soft-not-crumbly here and nicely warmed through, with generous amounts of clotted cream (always a must). After that, the third dessert chapter was also delicious, but - and I can't believe I'm saying this - possibly too much?! There's 2 full tiers of little cakes and dessert pots which are all so incredibly sweet that it's difficult for even a seasoned after tea-er like myself to finish everything they offer you, let alone any refills.\nThe service was attentive and friendly throughout, and I was glad we were seated in the light garden room, particularly when I walked through the larger inner room which had a different feel completely - more cave-like and much dimmer. That walk led me to the now-legendary toilets here, which reminded me of that scene in Godzilla when Matthew Broderick finds the eggs in Madison Square Garden. Only with multi-coloured lights on the ceiling and very bright white 'eggs'. In fact each pod is a toilet cubicle complete with its own sound system - mine seemed to be playing an old radio broadcast whilst my sister's played animal noises. It's a little confusing (still not sure whether there's separate guy/girl pods) but makes going to the loo an adventure in itself!\nIt all added to the slightly wacky arty vibe that shows they have a sense of humour behind all the serious art on the walls, and meant we were very happy to while away a few hours sipping tea refills, people-watching the very well put together crowd, and trying to find more dessert stomach space. It's a relatively reasonable price tag of \u00a335 for the full package you get, and my fave for a slightly quirky afternoon tea in London. They rotate the artists and room themes too - yet another reason to go back again :)"}, "913": {"rating": 5, "review": "The Sketch is an amazing place. \nI was visiting London for the first time and afternoon tea was a must during my visit.

My club sandwich had beetroot jelly and crayfish in it. Usually I like a club sandwich with chicken, bacon and mayo in it. My tastebuds were shocked but not in an entirely terrible way.\nWe visited the parlour, which is less formal than the other two eating rooms in Sketch. You can order what you want when you want, unlike the other two rooms which are more suitable for lunch, dinner and afternoon tea. As you walk in, you see a bar with lots of delicious looking and colourful cakes stacked high. Try and avoid that temptation. We couldn't! After my club sandwich I had a chocolate and coffee tart, which was heavier on the coffee side than the chocolate. That disappointed me a bit as I don't think you should ever have less chocolate in your life...\nIn the room, I was mesmerised by the different types of people. There was a fabulous old lady near us who had come in alone for a martini and cake and was reading a book. I want to be like that in a few years. There were some bloggers taking pics of their cake and cocktails and there were groups of friends. For some reason, there were very few men in the room. Maybe that's because the portions are on the small side or maybe it's because men don't appreciate  the quirkiness - they come to eat, then leave.\nIf it were for the toilets alone - individual cubicles shaped like eggs where men and women share the same wash basins it would get five solid stars. Six if I could give it six. The cubicles play bird song music, for goodness sake.

When we finally flagged down someone to take our orders, they were friendly enough, but took about 20 minutes to bring over the drinks. The cocktails were fine but nothing special. Given that we had popped in for a quick drink before dinner elsewhere, we ended up only having a few minutes to finish our drinks by the time they finally arrived, so it was disappointing to feel rushed. \nIn conclusion- I'd recommend sketch when you want to treat yourself to a nice afternoon tea, but would probably skip the cocktail rooms."}, "918": {"rating": 5, "review": "great experience here for afternoon tea! size of afternoon tea is definitely big enough, great selection of tea choices"}, "919": {"rating": 5, "review": "Such a fun environment!!

We dined for afternoon tea in the Gallery in September 2015.\nI originally intended to have dinner at the Gahban O'Keeffee-designed, two-Michelin-Star rated Lecture Room & Library, menu devised by the renowned Chef Pierre Gagnaire, yet an evening reservation with Dinner by Heston Blumenthal overruled. Nevertheless, I am ecstatic with my decision to have afternoon tea in the ethereal Gallery.\nThe pastel-pink color scheme and eclectic wall art made for great conversation. The prix-fixe afternoon tea menu featured a nice selection of tea choices, along with assorted finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries. This is an ideal venue to relax and catch up with friends over the course of an afternoon. See below for a more complete review.\nReservations:\nHaving originally held a booking for dinner in the Lecture Room and Library, we decided an afternoon affair would better suit our schedule; I made a booking for late afternoon tea. \nD\u00e9cor:\nSketch is located on the lovely Conduit Street. Upon noticing the oversized menu and illuminated red Sketch sign, we made our way inside and walked on a hopscotch board outlined on the floor-- I knew the afternoon would be filled with fun and good food. The soign\u00e9 hostesses greeted us with exceedingly pleasant vibes and lead us to the Gallery.\nOur eyes immediately met the vibrant pastel pink walls and couches. The walls are also covered in art by David Shrigley-- examining each would take quite a while, but I encourage you to look closely and carefully-- some are more interesting and risqu\u00e9 than others. This overall nouveau style created a chic setting for an enjoyable afternoon.\nTea Selections:\nThere are opportunities to order and sample a variety of teas. As with most afternoon teas, selections include green, black, white, oolong, herbal, and puerh. The teapots and cups feature intriguing thoughts and words.\nFinger Sandwiches, Scones, and Pastries:\nSome of my favorites include the cucumber and ricotta sandwich, sultana scone with traditional clotted cream or strawberry and fig jam, and chocolate mint cake. By the end of the afternoon, you'll hardly be able to finish the selections, even though the staff will continually bring more of whichever item you desire.\nService:\nThe staff was pleasant, yet in typical British fashion, maintain an overall hands-off approach, which allowed us to enjoy the afternoon with minimal interruptions.\nSummary:\nWe had a fantastic time enjoying Afternoon Tea at Sketch. From the splendid, unique d\u00e9cor to the delicious selection of finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries, Sketch provides an enjoyable afternoon outing. While most likely no longer a secret, you must visit the bathroom or, as they referred to in the UK, the toilet or water closet-- the egg-shaped pods and psychedelic rainbow roof elevate the overall Sketch experience. \nMy Recommendation:\nGo. While Afternoon Tea at Claridge's is still the ultimate afternoon tea experience in my opinion (see my review on Claridge's London), Sketch offers a great selection of afternoon treats and teas amidst an intriguing atmosphere. I will certainly return for tea in the Gallery; I also hope to return for dinner in the Lecture Room & Library. 4 Stars\nMichelin Stars: Two (2015)"}, "941": {"rating": 4, "review": "Sketch is a collection of fancy toilets conveniently located nearby a restaurant.\nFor anyone who is not familiar with sarcasm, it's a restaurant with fancy toilets.\nSketch is definitely an experience.

The only risky part of making a reservation is that if you don't go, you'll be charged the full amount of the tea service per person included in the party. I can understand this, since the turnover time for afternoon tea can be pretty slow. \nThe hype over the interior is not un-founded. Coming here is like walking onto the set of a Wes Anderson movie, and the fact that there are no windows really gives the effect that you've stepped down the rabbit hole into another world. There are differently decorated rooms (and a very interesting bathroom!), which will make for cute Instagram photos if that's what you've come here for. But me, I came here for the tea.\nOverall, the food was REALLY close to perfect. Everything was so tasty and fresh, and you can really tell that everything was made to order. I believe the price was 30 or 35 pounds per person, or somewhere around that range. It is completely worth it. You may order as many desserts, or sandwiches as your afternoon tea-loving heart wishes, and the waitresses do it speedily with a smile.

I personally cannot eat a huge amount in one sitting so I don't know if I would pay extra for all you can eat again, but it is good value for money in general. You can also add champagne to the deal for an extra 10 gbp. Definitely suggest to make reservations online a few days before to secure a spot. \nThe ambiance is to DIE for. There are a couple different rooms available for seating but we were placed in the big pink room which basically made all my little girl dreams come true.  That, along with the cute tea sets and the awesomely designed restroom pods all came together to create a really awesome experience. I am giving four stars because the selection of savory bites were a bit off for me and my friends which disrupted the experience a bit, but the delicious desserts made up for it. \nIf you're looking for a classic and traditional afternoon tea experience, I wouldn't recommend sketch- but if you're looking for a hip, trendy place to hang then this is definitely the place."}, "974": {"rating": 5, "review": "The food was phenomenal and the tea was perfect (though I'm a novice when it comes to tea).\nFirst off, I walked in without a reservation around 3pm on Sunday and it was a 40min wait. I had also tried the Saturday evening and they weren't taking walk ins. I highly recommend calling to make reservations. You must also wait in the building but it was fine b/c there's a cocktail room you can sit and enjoy the decor while you wait.\nOnce seated, I opted to order off the menu vs the pre-fixed afternoon tea (\u00a345 pp). I was so happy with the food - duck leg and beef roast - it was absolutely incredible. The tea was great as well - I ordered the jasmine. And, finished with chocolate and coffee cake.\nThe entire place is charming and visually intriguing. You must see the pink room and use the bathroom. The staff was really friendly, BTW.\nI was dressed pretty casually with jeans and heals. I was comfortable though a lot of other patrons wore dresses. I'd wear whatever you'd feel comfortable in but dresses and hats wouldn't be out of the norm for tea.\nOverall, I highly recommend this place; food, service, and general interior design."}, "975": {"rating": 4, "review": "Trendy and restaurant, food was pretty tasty as well.

They come deshelled and were delicious\nChantilly Lace (w/ black rice, basmati rice and lobster bisque): They pour the lobster bisque over the rice and its an experience to see\nSteamed Cod demi-sel (w/ mussels and grilled baby leeks): Fantastic especially if you like seafood\nDessert: Sketch Chocolate - soooo yummy, it was not too sweet, definitely should like chocolate though\nSERVICE:\nEveryone was very attentive, even if they were not our particular server, they still came by to check in with us.  They don't waste any time when it comes to taking your order though, we had to ask a few times for more time to decide.  This is definitely not a bad problem to have though.  \nAMBIANCE \nEach room has their own decor and vibe.  Outside of the food, the restaurant itself is beautiful and quirky at the same time.  Definitely view the other rooms, especially the bathroom."}, "988": {"rating": 4, "review": "Everything about the atmosphere here is quirky and unique. The washroom is filled with egg shaped pods and they play the sounds of geese at you while you do your thing. The walls in the pink room were all plush and, well, pink.

All the decor when we walked in oozed character, not to mention the hostess that was pretty much speaking the proper queen's english. \nOnce we walked into the dining room it's a completely different vibe.  Really abstract sketches were on every wall, and made for great reading if your eyes decided to wander during tea.  Tea service was everything I expected.  You get little finger sandwiches with smoked salmon and caviar and little dessert things.  Everything was top shelf.  Then you get your fancy tea with scones and jam.  On top of the food and tea being great the service was top notch.  You could tell that they were professionals.  Our waitress was on top of everything without being overbearing at all.  \nI couldn't review this place without mentioning the bathroom.  You pretty much need to check it out even if you don't have to go.  Imagine a staircase that leads up to a white room where like 5 giant eggs sit.  These eggs have doors so you can step inside where the toilet is.  On top of that, there are speakers inside the eggs that play ducks quacking at you.  It's crazy.  \nOverall, sketch might be a little pricey but the food service and ambiance are more than worth the price of admission."}, "992": {"rating": 3, "review": "Maybe Sketch is for you but it's not for me. To give you an idea if you might like Sketch, here are some of its most important characteristics: \n- The dining room is all pink! Everything is pink except for the art on the wall which is black and white\n- The bathroom is so weird, it gave me nightmares. It's an array of egg-shaped toilet pods that evokes the movie Aliens, except the monster hatching inside is your poo. Inside the egg pod, there are loud rainforest sound effects with a man counting down numbers which made me feel like the egg would hatch open if I didn't hurry. Not the most relaxing toilet experience  \n- Food and drinks are mostly tasty but all came out a bit unexpected. My BF had the filet mignon and it was good. For my main dish, I ordered chicken. Except the chicken was diced up in BBQ sauce with popcorn. Straight up microwave popcorn and literally popcorn chicken with BBQ sauce. You should probably avoid that one if you can.\nIt's an eclectic place that's for sure!"}, "993": {"rating": 3, "review": "I was taken to Sketch by my boyfriend as a part of my birthday treat. It was our second visit. As we're both David Shrigley fans, we wanted to visit the place again in the current incarnation.\nI love The Gallery, I imagine I'm in a Wes Anderson film for 2 hours.\nWe had  booking for 6.30 and when we arrived 10 minutes before the time, we were told to wait along with another few guests for the evening service, which we were told starts at 6.30 (although there were already people inside). Literary 2 minutes lady a posh looking couple arrived, storming the door and were immediately escorted into the main room. That wasn't nice. \nI recommend coming at the very beginning of the serving time as the place is mostly empty, so it's nicer and quieter, so you can enjoy the place more for yourself and take photos without  feeling embarrassed and risking catching come c-celebrity in your selfie.\nI started with the sashimi, which was meant to be an homage to the artist in residency, but was nothing more than an average and over-salted sashimi at a double price. The started was followed by a prawn dish, that was tasty, but not very big (literary 6 prawns with a spicy sauce) My boyfriend had a fish pie and that was much better and very filling. After two average dishes we found it hard to pick desserts as most of the descriptions weren't convincing. In the end I picked up what was sounding at least half exciting, but turned out to be one of the most fun desserts I've ever had. It was a creamy milky soup with pink bubble gum tasting ice-cream, tiny marshmellows, and pop candies. As a birthday babe I also got two tiny sweets. \nThe wine by glass is well overpriced. Even if good quality, you get a tiny amount in a huge glass that last for about 3 sips and then you have to order again.

Speaking of staff, they all wear designer outfits which were remarkable and so fashion forward I would have totally bought one.

When you first walk through the entrance of the building through a black curtain you come across hopscotch drawn on the floor what a way to enter but instead of walk in hop in.  You then pass many pieces of different art work on the walls.  You can check your coat in at the reception area before entering the restaurant.  The Gallery (restaurant) when you walk in you are blown away by the colour pink, pink and more pink.  Basically everything was pink from the comfy cushy chairs to the waitress's uniforms which was designed by a top designer.  When me and my friend was given the menu and we opened it up this pop up of knifes and forks made out of paper came springing up what a novelty and such a surprise.  The menu was quite hard to understand with its wording but the waitress explained it well.  I opted for the lamb dish and my friend the prawns and for a side we had mashed potatoes.  My lamb was very nice and the mash was the best mash I have had but for \u00a35 I feel it was overpriced.  My friends dish was also very nice and sweet and different but for four prawns at \u00a328 with some salad around them again overpriced.  For dessert I opted for the pavlova which was done differently to a normal pavlova and she opted for the chocolate dessert which looked like a chocolate U.F.O .had landed on her plate.  Again desserts nice but again perhaps a tad overpriced.  Whilst you are there you should go and check out the toilets.  Firstly you go up a lit staircase pink for girls and blue for boys.  You will then come across loads of pods like an alien has planted them there.  Inside the pods is the toilet and music so odd and different but then afterall Sketch is all about art.  Even though we had a nice time and we loved the atmosphere of the restaurant as it had such a buzz and was packed and this was at 6.30pm and that is rare to see a restaurant packed at this early time I would not go back purely because I feel it is overpriced for what you get to eat BUT saying this it has to be done to be experienced especially for the unusual toilet area."}, "1008": {"rating": 5, "review": "I went to sketch for afternoon tea back in December to celebrate my birthday.

The Parlour is wonderful, no two sofas match, and everything inside is an eclectic, bohemian collection of furniture. Everything is pretty to look and rather interesting to check out. Everytime I go I'm greeted by a hopscotch game chalked onto the floor, which I always use when I think no one is looking:P \nI never leave without making sure my visitor has seen the bathrooms here, because they are really fun. One is covered in swarovski crystals (even the flush is a crystal you push), and on the way there you pass a statue of a sitting woman completely made of crystals. \nThe second bathrooms is even more fun. When I walked in, my first impression was of a blindingly white space filled with egg pods and odd noises. It is a bit disorienting to realize that each egg pod is a bathroom. The atmosphere is really different than any other bathroom I've been to, and the first time I went I was greeted by the sight of a girl dressed as a Victorian maid scrubbing the shiny white steps for all she was worth, and I wondered for a mad moment if I had been transported to a Victorian futuristic alternate universe. If I was coming for the first time, I wouldn't leave without going here, and hoping to see the cleaner lol.\nThe decor changes everytime a little, and I'm sure it is different for everybody. My favorite time was the first time because to get to the bathroom i had to pass through a room that was dim and had a video projected on all the walls of someone climbing trees with the loud and creepy sounds of the rustling trees and people. I was expecting lunch, not art, and the surprise was really fun.\nSpeaking of the lunch, the menu changes everytime I go as well. The first time I went I had the high tea, which was wonderful. They had the loveliest, fragrant jasmine green tea served in pretty tea cups, and a hazelnut chocolate cake that my husband and I fought over because it was so good. \nThe next time i went, the cake was gone and the other desserts though decent, were not quite at that level. Another time we tried the lunch and I had tiny black sandwiches which were quite fun although not that yummy.

Sketch is a great place to take people as it's very different - one of a kind place you'll see in London. Definitely worth a visit. In what looks like a very small establishment on the outside, there are many different rooms on the inside including a 2-michelin star restaurant.\nAs for the Afternoon Tea - it's your pretty standard Afternoon Tea you'll expect at any London hotel with a more funky Sketch spin to it.  Of course you've got the tea to choose from.  Lots of tea choices. All good.  You've also got a variety of cakes they bring out... probably had my week's worth of sugar in that meal but all worth trying out.  Their finger sandwiches are very unique - for example their egg sandwich had a very small sunny side up egg on each sandwich. Nice attention to detail.  The scones were available afterwards (not much space on the table as there were 3 of us) and they came out warm with jam and clotted cream. Very tasty and above average for the food tasted.\nI would expect paying close to 30 quid for tea the service would be exceptional.  If I compare to other Afternoon Tea establishments for at other luxury hotels for roughly the same price the service is sub-par.  For example, tea was provided but not poured. We had to ask for sandwich refills rather than just being brought them.  These are the tiny things I'd expect. The staff, however, was nice friendly and we had a good meal."}, "1033": {"rating": 5, "review": "This place is soooo cute- makes sense since I initially saw it on a list of the most instagrammable places in London.

Also ordered an extra earl gray macaron and this raspberry rose macaron base tart (the one with full on rose pedals on top). Do recommend this over that puny droplet of earl gray macaron although the earl gray flavor was a nice touch in variety.\nOverall, very satisfied with my experience at this posh and chic place, a little pricey, but consider it worth it regarding all other aspects!"}, "1040": {"rating": 5, "review": "My dad and I went here for afternoon tea.

We waited over 20 minutes just to be greeted and receive a menu but noticed the server attend the table next to us at least 4 times in the same time span. Our order was never taken and finally we moved to the parlor. The server was more affable in that room but the service was still painfully slow. We had to wait another 20 minutes just for our coffees. It seemed they had one server for the entire room when they know the rooms will be full given you have to make a reservation beforehand. We noticed other tables complaining about the service and looking miserable as well. The menu was overpriced and the cheese and crackers was a complete rip off. Three of the thinnest crackers I've ever seen and some small cheese cubes on a plate for 12 pounds. The rest of the food was ok.

Obviously, the jelly was pre-made and put in the fridge and they just put the fish on top when someone orders it. It was quite blend. \n- Then came the red prawns which was actually quite good. \n- Foie Gras ravioli came after. I am a big fan of foie gras and I was not very pleased that they actually screw this one up. First off, putting foie gras in ravioli means it is not off the best quality, otherwise, you will never mess with it that way; secondly it was in a curry sauce which overpowered the nature taste of foie gras. I was not a happy camper. \n- Roasted pollock. It was a nice piece of roasted fish, and there was a bit of a surprise as escargot was used in the sauce. \n- Veal with sweetbreads wrapped in lettuce. They were served separately and I was wondering what the connection of these two flavors were. \n-Lastly, we were presented with 6 Pierre Gagnaire's desserts. They all looked very pretty, but there was one problem: except for one or two, they were not made onsite.

The asparagus in the cucumber sandwich lacked any seasoning whatsoever, and the mozzarella and pesto croque monsieur was surprisingly greasy and tasteless.\nThe scones and cream were probably the best thing about the whole meal - the scones are large and came to the table still warm, albeit with not quite enough clotted cream to go round. The fig jam was also delicious (and I say that as someone with a long time antipathy towards jam in general). \nThe cake selection is disappointingly free of British flavours and the cakes themselves are horrifyingly small - the coffee eclair was about the size of my little finger (and I have relatively slim digits) and the raspberry meringue...let's just say I've seen bigger engagement rings. Call me a greedy beggar, but if you can eat it in one mouthful, it's not a cake, it's a petit fours, or in this case, a disappointment. Both the pistachio macaroon and the berry tartlet could have been quite delicious but (like so much else about Sketch) suffered from a wearying overkill with the addition of an unnecessary berry jam/compote in the middle. \nYou do at least get free tea refills, but the staff dropped the ball by bringing my flowering tea out after it had infused, thereby denying me the visual pleasure of watching it bloom (which is pretty much the whole point of ordering a flowering tea).\nOverall, I might have been reasonably content with the food were it not for the disproportionate price tag which appears to be a function of the achingly pretentious interiors and service. Call me old-fashioned, but I'd much rather have my food served up by polite, friendly professional wait staff without legions of wannabe models floating around purposelessly in utilitarian chic shirt dresses."}, "1124": {"rating": 1, "review": "it's okay.

It looks like a trendy nightclub at the entrance (I think there is a bar on the ground floor).  We were led past the velvet rope, up the stair case and went past a few heavy curtains to arrive at The Lecture Room where our table was waiting.\nTheir surroundings are just what I want to see in this kind of restaurant.  Rich, colourful carpets and decorations flowing with luxury.  Comfy seats.  Dining here is an experience. The service was friendly and efficient, not stuffy. They made some jokes with us, which makes a nice difference.  We also got a mini menu to take home with us.  Another nice touch.\nWe opted for the 7 course tasting menu. There was a vegetarian tasting menu and a la carte options available too.\nBreads. Served in a bowl, warm and crusty, but there was only one type of bread. There were two butters: citrus and a regular one.  The citrus one didn't quite sit right, it tasted like you were eating a lemon creme biscuit.\nAmuse bouches.  A mini macaron with blue cheese cream, a disc of goat cheese and a mini roll which tasted like melon.  There was also a little bowl of crunchy parmesan bites.\nEarth and sea 3. Great contrasts of flavours and textures. Looked like a raviolo, but it was a blanket of cuttlefish over the other ingredients (squid, pineapple and crunchy fennel). I liked the look of the mini lettuce filled with crab meat.\nCrayfish served with onion and turmeric jus. Came with spelt which gave the disk a nice texture.  The crayfish was obviously the hero of the dish and were tasty morsels.\nPascaline.  I'm not sure what pascaline is (!) but this dish was firmly based around scallops, which I love.  We had fried scallops and fresh (raw) mushrooms on top of a scallop mousse and a mushroom sauce.  It tasted just as it sounds. I liked the scallop mousse the most.\nHake, Savoy cabbage and razor clams. Nicely cooked fish and cabbage, I liked the clams. They were like prizes. The crumb coating on the fish tasted like lawn, which is not a bad thing.\nJellied sardine, fois gras, celeriac, frozen raspberries. This was the most interesting looking dish of the night, with the huge cubes of jelly and the star-shaped dish.  Unfortunately, it was not entirely my cup of tea, but it had solid flavours.  It felt like a lot of sardine jelly to get through.  I would have preferred simply fried sardines, but I could see how this may have been too close in nature to the previous course.\nHereford beef fillet, with turnip gratin and crispy aubergine.  The beef was cooked nicely, but for me the most interesting part was the cripsy vegetable chip on top.\nPierre Gagnaire's Grand Dessert.  This was six desserts which came out on separate plates, 3 at a time.  They covered a wide range of tastes and textures, with my favourites being the chocolate ones.\nPetits fours.  There was a jelly, a mini tart and a chocolate.  Nice, but not too special.\nI had been looking forward to our visit here for weeks, but when the date arrived I had been sick for a couple of days and had a sore throat.  It was a shame because I wouldn't have got the full taste experience.  It was an expensive meal, but in line with my price expectations."}, "1128": {"rating": 4, "review": "I'll be upfront, the stars are mostly for the decor and the bathrooms.

You are paying for the decor and what decor it is. Over the top in all ways both good and bad. \nI came here for lunch so I can't rate the dinner service. The tea service was also going on while I was there and it looked quite nice if I on the dainty side. I would still like to try it as would I like to try the overpriced dinner service.\nI ate lunch in the parlour, it's probably the most boring room but still charming, there is the main dining room which was closed for lunch and the garden room which is very charming and of course the toilet which are egg-like free standing pod in a elevated white platform. \nI got the haddock souffle which was surprisingly good if very overpriced at 14 pounds but compared to the 46 pound dishes on the dinner menu, it's steal.\nThe service was horrible even more so since they automatically add a \"discretionary\" 12 percent service fee which as a North American I would have a hard time asking a server to remove. But seriously the manager had to yell at the server to actually come over and take my order as well as the person next to me. I had to flag them down to get the bill and this was in a room with only four table occupied. It was my first time encountering a discretionary fee being added to the bill without my approval although it appears to be a horrible trend in service lacking London. Again if you are going to charge for service, you need to actually provide it.  \nSo if you want to check out the decor without spending the big buck eat in the Parlour.\nThe bathrooms are not in any way wheelchair accessible and the whole space is not designed for any kind of accessiblity."}, "1129": {"rating": 5, "review": "Lindsey in Wonderland!!!!!

The opulent townhome has served as the headquarters for the Royal Society of British Architects, the atelier of Christian Dior, and is currently home to the 2 star Michelin-rated French restaurant run by Executive Chef, Pierre Gagnaire.\nEven if French food isn't your cup of tea, if your pockets are deep enough, I suggest that you at least pay a visit to check out the unique ambiance. The d\u00e9cor is parallel to none; with each room in the space taking you on a journey that is evocative of trippy dream. There are three different dining rooms--each one offering a different menu and price point--as well as two ultra posh cocktail lounges. The whole venue is a riot of color and an onslaught to the senses. But the loud and quirky design makes this Michelin restaurant feel, dare I say, comfortable?!\nAfter studying all of the menus, I chose to dine at the Gallery, which is the more informal restaurant space with more reasonably priced menu items. British artist, Martin Creed, has transformed the space into a serviceable museum of modern art with eclectic chairs and one-of-a-kind dinnerware.\nTo start, I ordered the Chestnut Velout\u00e9 with white truffle oil, and pan-fried squid saut\u00e9ed with garlic and cherry tomatoes (\u00a315). It was velvety, rich, and every bit delicious. I cleared the bottom of my bowl with the trio of freshly baked breads that were brought to the table (\u00a34).\nThe second appetizer that I tried was the Dublin bay prawn tempura with haricot beans and aubergine, accompanied by an Osframpi sauce (\u00a325). The prawns were delicious but sadly, there were only three of them--typical French portions! I didn't expect the vegetables would also be deep fried, and I found them a bit bourgeois in contrast to the otherwise haute cuisine. The osframpi sauce was magical, however, due in part to the fact that I've never tasted one before. Essentially, it is a puree of wild berries balanced with some sort of lemon acidity to cut the sweetness. I did not use it for the prawns, but rather as a spread for the breadbasket.\nFor my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the Cannon of lamb roasted en cr\u00e9pine, Ni\u00e7oise socca, swiss chard pomponette (\u00a328). The lamb was cooked to perfection and the sauce dressing the plate was to die for, but I have had better cuts of meat before. I cleared the plate none-the-less, which easy to do at a French restaurant--oftentimes in just two bites!\nThere was little hesitation when it came to choosing a dessert; naturally, I opted for the chocolate one: Sketch Chocolat, which is a dark chocolate box filled with vanilla cream, nougatine, dried fruits, caramel syrup and coffee genoise. On the side, of the box was a little shooter filled with pistachio ice cream with pineapple and mango coulis (\u00a310). I also got the suggested after-dinner drink, The Whisk Away, made with Laphroaig Whisky and Kalua (\u00a37). The coffee notes in the dessert and cocktail complimented one another beautifully.\nAll in all, Sketch is about the experience: the art, the atmosphere, the service, the exotic bathrooms! Sure, the food is very, very good, but it is the ambiance that is over-the-top. I would certainly return, possibly in some high heels next time, with slightly lower expectations of the food."}, "1132": {"rating": 5, "review": "Never disappoints !!!I love visiting this place , its classy with a very different artistic touch !!

Sketch is one of those places that would almost be most enjoyed if no one had ever told you about the details of it's decorations and you stumble upon it yourself. Although this restaurant has apparently been a London classic for nearly 10 years, I first learned of this restaurant after making a reservation for Pierre Gagnaire's original restaurant in Paris. When I asked around, everyone in London described that it's decoration alone is worth a visit, especially the loos. I jumped on this chance when I had friends in town who wanted to meet for breakfast (reservations taken before noon at the Parlour).  \nThe Parlour is probably the most tamed/classic of all the rooms. It is a tea room and stays true to that. A walk through the other rooms and the design element didn't disappoint. I'd say imaginative, arty, and eclectic (part Sandusky hotel, part vintage). I wish no one had told me about the loos and left me to discover it myself, so I'll leave out details here. \nA few other patrons were having afternoon tea and it looked decent. We ordered lunch (burger, tartare and salads) and it was OK. 4 stars for the decor (even with the hype) and 3 stars for the Parlour food. Tea selection was good.  I think you take Sketch for what it is. Perfect for bringing guests looking for a surprise element but I wouldn't go for those looking for a classic Chez Gagnaire food experience.

We started off with a tomato soup and bread brought in a Lego basket. Then, I had both the pate and foie gras burger. Both were fine, but not exceptional. The presentation on both was phenomenal.

The scone was spot on. \nWe sat in the parlor room, which had a very interesting chandelier and paintings that demand more than a passing glance.

Be aware of the price point.\nI'm glad we booked up in the Lecture Room; when we got a tour of the rest of the premises, the other dining rooms were much louder, much more buzzy, and much less, well, classy. (Also, the pod bathrooms are cute, but they didn't smell or look particularly clean on a Saturday night; I'm glad that the Lecture Room had its own facilities, which were bling-tastic but impeccably clean.)\nWhen I visit a new place like this, I generally opt for the tasting menu to get a broad sweep of the chef's style. The food here is very much nouvelle Continental. You won't encounter anything particularly exotic or flamboyant, but you can generally depend on classic flavours done right.\nI felt that some of the menu items shone, like the venison, whilst others were a touch off base. A couple of the sauces were too bland, and the kamut (or spelt; I can't actually recall) was overly salty. Portions were small, as expected, but very slow to arrive; overall, we were there nearly five hours, including the 20-30min tour of the building, which is quite a long time for a seven-course meal.\nService was mostly impeccable. One of the waiters was less than willing to make a substitution for one member of our party, which was a touch off, but the chef came up with a compromise. Likewise, the sommelier butted heads with me on a few of the wine choices, despite my explaining to him that I was choosing them to be in line with the more conservative palates at the table.\nDessert was visually pretty but all components were overly sweet and not particularly refined. \nI would have liked to have seen a greater overarching story to the meal; instead, it felt like individual components cobbled together in only a roughly increasing degree of intensity rather than gastronomic cohesion.\nEnjoyable, and a good choice for a celebratory dinner, but I can't say that any of the dishes were memorable enough to make me rush back."}, "1142": {"rating": 1, "review": "Terrible service, mediocre food, weird and tacky decor.

The food was good - egg sandwiches are always a winner and nice to have vegetarian options for afternoon tea. Tea was out of a tea bag, not PG tips mind but still out of a bag.

The salmon came in a separate side dish and was melt in your mouth delicate, with an accompaniment of lightly cooked tomatoes, and toast. \nI liked that all the constituent parts were on separate plates enabling you to build your own breakfast as you ate, and it meant that the toast stayed crunchy, the salmon kept cool and the tomatoes didn't leach into the eggs.\nOther options include their take on a full English or continental breakfast, eggs benedict, pastries, porridge, muesli and fruit, so there's a decent, albeit fairly traditional, selection on offer.\nAnd of course given their focus on afternoon tea, they have an extensive range of teas and herbal infusions available, although on this occasion I went for a cafeti\u00e8re of one of the \"rare and exotic\" coffees, which was just right. \nI will definitely be finding a reason to brunch here again!"}, "1155": {"rating": 5, "review": "The Sketch is such an amazing and interresting place.

The next two levels were different sorts of pastries - all delicious. My favorite was the pistachio. Next came scones with cottled cream and fig and strawberry jam.

This is probably the only reason I'd tell anyone to visit Sketch which is really quite wrong. Big giant pods with maids cleaning around it. A real-life bizarre dream. \nSketch has different rooms with different atmospheres and a restaurant between the bars. The bar which you would first walk in has a calmer ambience with elegant yet crazy furniture. The room on the far end is very small and much darker with a bar in the middle of the room. The bar sits lower than the ground floor so that you are much taller than the barmen. \nPrices are quite shocking but the cocktails were nice. Definitely not amazing. And it took at least 25 minutes for two cocktails to come. \nThe service was top notch. Great staff, handsome men at the doors and between each bar standing straight and elegantly. \nSketch"}, "1165": {"rating": 5, "review": "Woah.  Sketch is a work of art which contains works of art.\nCame here with a small group to celebrate my 32nd (ugh) birthday a couple weeks ago.  We had dinner in the Gallery.  Sketch is a larger building comprised of several different portions.  There's the Parlour where I believe they have afternoon tea, the Gallery, in which we sat and ate and gawked and marveled, upstairs is the Lecture Room which boasts a Michelin star.  There are also a couple smaller bar areas, one of which looks like you stepped into a fairy tale forest, and another which I unfortunately didn't discover!\nThe decor in the Gallery is everything I could ever aspire to dream of in a future home.  The furnishings are completely mismatched.  No fork looks like any other fork... same can be said for every other utensil, glass, chair, table, etc.  Oh, I love it so!  It's a feast for the eyes.\nNo complaints about the food or drink either.  I had the Chantilly Lace as a starter which is basically lobster bisque with a tiny tower of tri-colored rice in the middle which was black rice (squid ink), red pepper rice, and regular basmati rice.  It was fantastically delicious.  Roast leg of lamb main, which was basically tiny chunks of lamb with bean and a gorgeous broth, and the \"Lemon\" for dessert.  It's just called \"Lemon.\"  And it delivers on the name.  Again, every plate is a carefully constructed work of art.  I wish I could shake the hand of that pastry chef because man, was that Lemon something to see.\nAs we were leaving, a gentleman caught me and a friend gawking at the art (which we found it is commissioned specifically for Sketch), and quickly started telling us how he'd worked there for years and Sketch was his passion and he very nicely showed us around to the rest of the building!  He snuck us upstairs to the Lecture Room and let us peek in, told us the history of the building (it used to be the House of Dior), and told us more about the art and showed us the equally spectacular bathrooms on the upper floor which are meant to be the inside of a jewelry box.  Quite the contrast from the crazy insane egg-pod bathrooms near the Gallery (all bathrooms attended by ladies in stereotypical \"french maid\" outfits, bee tee dubs).\nMy only complaint is that they were completely out of their famed hot chocolate!

When she came back to take our drink order she was visibly annoyed when my sister and I (we were with our mother) requested sparkling water and no cocktails (my mom ordered a martini). It was clear that from this point forward we were an afterthought as we were not a high \"money making/bill running\" table (since we were not planning to drink.) As she kindly described the menu and specials to other tables around us as they sipped their cocktails, we were simply asked if we were ready. We ordered at 9:40 after being asking twice and our meal was delivered by 9:50. It was clear our table was being rushed out the door to turn us over quickly. we felt very upset as this was our last night and we wanted an experience and not to be rushed in and out. My mother asked to speak with a manager and he was so arrogant and rude that it was inexplicable. the customer is never right at sketch!!! he gave her a great deal of attitude when she explained she felt upset.

That's the kind of thing you want to stick in people's minds.\nThe parlour itself is beautiful, like a funky dream place from Alice and Wonderland. Filled with interesting things to look at, we tucked into a table near the window and enjoyed the sun while we waited for our orders to be taken.\nHere's the tough part: we waited.\nAt a place like Sketch, especially for lunch on a Thursday where the parlour is maybe 1/3 full, waiting shouldn't be part of the equation. Much less should we have had to flag down service each time we wanted something.\nWe ordered the burger, chips, and the macaroni cheese. I was pleased with my mac-cheese, but my friend was disappointed in the size of his burger. As a guy, I understand, because it was nowhere near enough to fill a person, much less for the prices we were paying. I especially dislike letting down people with my recommendations, which is another strike in my mind.\nThe decoration is of course cool--I had the chance to walk through and look at the other dining rooms on the way to the coolest bathroom in London (though I do have an issue with the idea of having such an obviously hip, gender-neutral bathroom color coded in pink and blue... stereotyping much?? What about individuals who don't identify as \"blue\" or \"pink\"?). It seems like a nice place for a really great experience, at a really high price.

The starters were good but the main dish (we both got the same - chicken fricassee) was bland and flavorless. It was as if the chicken was boiled. Perhaps the other dishes are better.

My rosemary martini tasted nothing like rosemary nor a martini. Reading the ingredients, it was expected, but still, rosemary would be nice. The other half wanted another cocktail, so the waiter brought him the cocktail menu (for the Lecture Room). There weren't many and they were way too expensive. It was close to \u00a350 for an old fashioned, and while it was with really rare bourbon, it seemed a bit too expensive. So the other half asked if he could order a drink from downstairs. He was told no. He was told he could go downstairs and get one, but they wouldn't make one upstairs nor bring it up for him. (Annoying). He went downstairs. The maitre d' saw him going downstairs. He was with other people, but eventually caught up and told him that they would take the drink to him upstairs. And they comped him because he should never have been told to go downstairs and get it. The comp was nice, but it was annoying he had to go down and ask for it in the first place.\nAt the table, we were told we couldn't use both the voucher and the promo code. Which made no sense. A voucher is money they already have. It's not like we were trying to use 3 promo codes or anything. Nava agreed that we could use ours. My other half had to talk to them at the end of the meal. The manager agreed that we could use both, obviously, but the fact we had to actually discuss it with them was annoying. (The trend here is annoying, in case you haven't noticed.)\nThe food was actually pretty good. Most of it. However, they left the plastic backing on part of my food, which I had to eat around. Really two-Michelin star restaurant? Plastic? I also had a bone or plastic in my fish as well. Two courses in a row? It's annoying (and puzzling). The chicken curry was fantastic. They really enjoy giving you two or three dishes at once. (Or in the case of dessert, SIX. Yes we had six different tiny plates surrounding each of us. My other half was overwhelmed and felt rushed to eat it because it was all there at once.) And they liked to whisk the plates away at random times. I'm used to dining in the UK where they take plates away all at once, but the constant whisking away of plates was a bit unnerving. The hot chocolate was good, very good. Not the best I've ever had to be honest. Given that good chocolate is fairly new to the UK, I can understand why people would think it's the best. I'd have it again to be sure, but I've had far better in the States. The seaweed butter was to die for though. I've never had it, and I kind of fell in love with it. We ran out early, and had to ask for more. Irritatingly. We were almost out of butter and they kept bringing us bread. It's not hard to notice that more butter was required.\nThe wine. It was really good. So good we do what we often do and see if we can find it to have at home (because wine at home is usually about half the price. There's a markup, I get it, I don't mind paying double for a bottle when you're at a restaurant). We couldn't find it anywhere in the UK, but they were about \u20ac15 a bottle on the mainland. Now I'm pretty good at math, but you don't really need to be great to figure out prices. I know it's more expensive for booze in the UK (thank you taxes), so \u20ac15 a bottle equates to about \u00a325-30 a bottle in shops in the UK. Now double that, it's pretty standard at a restaurant. That's about \u00a350-60 a bottle if you're out. Now these wines were about \u00a375-90 a bottle. That's a triple markup. I shouldn't be surprised since they were selling glasses of Balfour sparkling wine for \u00a330 a glass. I can get it at home for about \u00a340 a bottle. Do the math. Six times \u00a340 is \u00a3240 pounds. That's way more than a triple markup. Triple markups are a bit too much for my liking.\nThe decor is pretty fab though. All the rooms are decorated differently and you can tell they spent a lot of work making it look the way it does. The big cushy seats in the Lecture room were also great for eating dinner in!\nSo overall, I had a good time, the food was good. The service needed a lot of work (so very surprised with the two-Michelin star rating). It seemed the servers needed a lot more training to understand what Michelin star service should entail. I'm probably not going back when there are lots of other places to try and since I wasn't wowed by my experience, I'll be moving on."}, "1210": {"rating": 5, "review": "I've been dying to go to this place for ages, mainly for the bathrooms that everyone keeps raving about. What finally got me here was it being the 1st stop of the Mayfair chocolate tour as Sketch is reputed to have the best hot chocolate in London.\nVerdict? Yep definitely some of the best hot chocolate I've ever had, and by far the best in London. It's rich, creamy, full of deep chocolate flavour, but light enough not to weigh you down. It comes in posh porcelain tea cups which is a little odd as I consider hot chocolate best served in a mug with little marshmellows but then again that's usually when made at home or around a fire.\nThe bathrooms are just hilarious, and fittingly odd for the place. To put into context, you first walk up a short flight of stairs and in front of you is a beam of light which changes colour periodically. Cool but nothing special until you turn your head away from it and a word flashes out at you from the corner of your eye. It's almost as if you are seeing things but it is just a strange optical illusion definitely sets the scene. \nThe sculputures around the restaurant, cafe, and club areas are a bit disturbing and what I imagine the artwork of Chucky to be like. My favourity was the slim female figure in an almost Thinker pose with a big afro. Which wouldn't be that unusual until you realise that the \"afro\" is made up of hundreds of syringes stuck needle first into the head of the figure.\nThere is a Michelin starred restaurant above (didn't make it there, but planning on it soon!) and a large open room that you can easily see being a dance floor at night. The room is ringed with projectors that can cover all four walls with pictures and movies although in this dark open space with white couches, the only playing was a indie art flick that I could only describe as the lovechild of the Ring and The Twilight Zone. Needless to say I didn't linger in this room and rushed to the bathrooms just next door. \nThe bathroom area is actually above a sunken spherical bar and boys go left while girls go right but a curving white staircase. In contrast to the room of horrors of a club, this is pure dazzling white. You pick an egg, cocoon yourself in side, and go about your business. Oh and don't be scared if you hear voices...everyone does.\nOverall, loved the unique atmosphere that Sketch delivers and just walking around is a rush.

I've never been so amazed with a toilet in my life.  The pods are like big fancy port-o-potties in a sense, though much cleaner and you don't feel like the whole thing could topple over.  After exiting the pod when your business is complete, there are maids standing around to offer any assistance you need.  Now that is service!\nI was only here for my office Christmas party, so I can't say that I've truly experienced Sketch in all its glory.  But, it is definitely cool.

When we arrived the following day for lunch, we were seated in the Parlour until our table was ready, and the staff was ready to assist. We were greeted by the maitre d' who told us that the chef would be ready shortly, and then gave us a tour of Sketch, and the history of the establishment. He led us upstairs into the Lecture Room and Library where our table awaited with a full-on french staff ready to assist. \nI was given a stool for my purse, and the napkins were placed in each of our laps. In the background you can hear music playing. Very similar to a finger piano, which has an almost eerie sound. We both went with the fixed lunch menu, which was three courses, plus palette cleansers, and after dinner espresso with chocolates. Overall the presentation was breath taking, and every dish was very creative.  \nThe service was impeccable! Our pretty french waitress was on point the entire meal. She wiped every crumb from the table, and instructed us on proper consumption of the more bizarre artistic entrees. For example: when I thought I was supposed to eat some sand at the beginning of the meal that was holding thin crackers. She informed me that I should not be eating it, awesome lol... I'd also like to brag about their cheese plate selection, it was the finest I have ever seen at a restaurant. After lunch, we were allowed to explore the art studios in the back where different events are held each night.

I had a few surprise visitors from home (NYC) and I wanted to make sure they didn't leave London without having afternoon tea.  I also didn't want a boring traditional afternoon tea either.  I've done the traditional swanky afternoon tea at the Ritz and I did enjoy it but its some place I'd take my mom.  This place was just what the doctor ordered. The main comment I got from my friends is that they felt like they were in Alice In Wonderland (good thing the Mad Hatter's Tea at the Sanderson was booked up).  As soon as I got there there was a doorman with tophat and I got a little nervous because of my attire (its summer and I had \"stylish\" flipflops on) but I trucked on in anyway.  My friends were waiting from me and I was immediately pleasantly surprised by my surroundings.  I passed the cafe - for the sorry sods that weren't smart enough to book - and walked into can only described as a tea room in a red forest.  the lighting was soft red and I passed some truly artistic trays of edible art.  Our party each decided to have the Afternoon Tea \u00a325 but I decided on the champagne tea which came with 1 glass of champagne (Pommery Ampanage) along with unlimited tea at \u00a346.  I don't think that is particularly worth it but the presentation of the glass of champagne was definitely something to see.  We all chose different teas so we could sample each others. Mine was jasmine, but the ladies ordered berry hibiscus, vanilla, and rose hip tea.  I liked all but the rose tea.  Now for the sweet and savoury goodies... WONDERFUL. Anyone who thinks they won't be full is terribly misguided.  We had servings for 5 people and we left with 2 beautiful takeaway boxes because we couldn't finish it all.  The Assorted finger sandwiches were smoked salmon and Jacob's cream cucumber, ricotta and asparagus, MY FAVORITE mozzarella and pesto croque monsieur, and egg and mayonnaise, quail egg, caviar were seriously tasty and is NOT your everyday egg salad sandwich.  It also came with 5 warm and buttery Sultana scones\nserved with clotted cream, bitter orange and strawberry jam. All the jams and creams were so fresh I didn't care that I felt the pounds literally developing as I ate.  And finally, the edible are which were the sweets selection of pistachio macaroons, almond and berry tartlet,coffee \u00e9clair.  We ate our strawberry cheesecake in a glass because we knew we couldn't take it with us. The only thing I didn't like and its only because I am not a big marshmallow fan was the mousse malabar marshmallows which tasted like spongy chalk but again... I am NOT a fan of marshmallows and other people will probably love them. There were other sweets but honestly I can't remember the names and here's a warning: these pastries are meant to be eaten THE DAY YOU GET THEM.  Not that you'd be able to resist but as I said we were so full we had to go boxes and after tea went shopping, by the time I got home my macaroons lost their air so they shrunk and of course wasn't as pretty but just as tasty.  Our waitress was super sweet and I only have to say you have to SEE the restroom in order to believe it. The bathroom mirrors are just a small part (they say: You're beautiful and remember I'm a mirror so I can't tell a lie) of how awesome the bathroom is.I am going back there again and again again and I highly recommend."}, "1217": {"rating": 4, "review": "Coolest loo in all of London!  \nThis place is just dripping with coolness.

At Sketch - as one of the rare exceptions in\nLondon - a club membership is not needed for having a good\nnight out.

The sommelier was very helpful in choosing a wine that paired with our food selection.  We had the lobster bisque as a starter, the venison for our main, and the chocolate cake for 2 for our dessert.  The lobster bisque was very well done with the rice, lobster and bisque all being mixed in front of us.  The venison dish was only okay.  By the time dessert had arrived, I had forgotten what I had as my main.  The main was not worth the value, but given the ambiance and quality of the other dishes - it was alright.

This is not your standard grab a quick dinner establishment, but a highly sophisticated dining enlightenment that was truly savored over the course of almost 3 hours.  I have to pay a massive compliment to our host Sebastien, who really took us on a journey of some of the finest foods London has to offer.  Let me offer up an example of Sebastien's amazing attention to the guest as well as details.  We ordered the cheese course to start the evening (i was treating one of my best friends to a Birthday dinner), and the normal thought process would be that the restaurant brings out a cheese board with a variety of breads and spreadable flavors.  Sketch takes it to the stratosphere by rolling out 4 separate mobile cutting boards and presenting the diner with a cheese entourage from around the world.  We probably had over 40 different types of cheese to select from, and Sebastien took his time to review everyone of them. We took his suggestions (all of them) and he cut very generous pieces from each selection, and then suggested the order in which to appreciate them.  This in itself was over an hour, and the whole process was fascinating.  I cannot throw out enough positive adjectives regarding the entire dinner experience, as every course, including the artfully crafted desert, was stunning.  Now, here is where Sebastien and Sketch go over the top to secure themselves in my own personal Restaurant Hall of Fame.  Sebastien comes over to the table, asks us to put down our napkins, and follow him.  How do you not comply with this request? Sebastien walks us back to the kitchen to meet the head chef and the brigade... AWESOME!  I felt like we were walking the Hall of Honors, and the Chef could not have been more gracious to us.  How was the rest of the service? As outstanding as it could possibly be.  From the gentleman pouring the water, to the waiter who refilled the bread and to the management that checked on us, as well as gave us a tour of the entire complex, we felt like the red carpet was specially rolled out for a personal experience unlike any other.

As many of the reviews here rightly point out, the venue itself is amazing, and there's something extra special about turning off a busy Regent St and ducking into this charming maze of quirky grandiosity. But I digress. \nThe afternoon tea itself was really delicious. I should disclose at this point that  gluten and I do not get along, so afternoon tea always requires a bit of compromise for me. However in the course of my fledgling love affair with this quintessentially English way to spend the pre-twilight hours, I have learned that the swisher establishments can usually cater accordingly. My lovely wife has no such handicap, so she was able to enjoy the full offering as the chef intended it, and it looked delicious - particularly the sweetish glazed smoked salmon buns. Not that I'm bitter. Really.\nThe first problem was our seating. We were in the parlour, which is where they accommodate the overflow from the front room. It's a nice room in itself - warm pinkish tones and pleasantly spacious, but we were tucked away into a corner behind the door and the effect wasn't so cosy. There were three staff in the area but they seemed to struggle with the demands of the room. \nThe real problem was with the presentation of the food. They brought out each person's entire meal on a lovely looking cake stand. While this looked good, it didn't really work because the scones come out warm, as they should, but they're not the first course so by the time we got to them, they were cold.\nMy sandwiches were nice, but the gluten-free bread was nothing special. But the real disappointment for me was that when I asked for more, I was told that I would have to order off the menu. Now I've only eaten afternoon tea at two other places, but both times the extra sandwiches flowed freely. And at \u00a327 per person, I reckon Sketch can afford to get a little more generous with their precious sarnies. \nThe sweets were delicious, and so too was the tea. But we were hustled out after an hour and a half, when we could have done with an extra 20 minutes or so.\nBasically it was good, but not great. There are a few too may buts that need to be addressed before they can be considered in the league of places like Claridge's, which definitely served the best afternoon tea that I've ever had.

I think the fact that we were there on a Wednesday night (making the place almost empty) may have added to the strangeness...

There's a lot of work that goes into looking that nonchalant, kind of in that way where the indie crowd spends hours on their hair to make it look like they've just rolled out of bed. \nVisually, I do love the place, but I think my visits are going to be sparse in the future as it's just not something I could justify the spend for on a regular basis.

It is expensive, but you get what you pay for!\nI was lucky enough to attend a dinner here last night hosted by business contacts. \nOn entering the main hall the general bar is the the right on the grouns floor, a long, open room riotous with colours and quirky artwork. On meeting my group we went down stairs to the rear of the venue to the Glade room for drinks. This bar is a bit quieter and makes talking a lot more simple. Ceilings are equally as high, with reddish-pink walls decorated with crystals and sequins in swirling patterns. Odd squat 70's furniture reminded me a little of my grandad. Don't worry, you're not being targeted by snipers - the circular rotating mirrors in the walls seem to reflect red lasers for some reason. All part of the 'artistic license'.\n After drinks we moved into the main Gallery restaurant, much more to my liking. The whole space is white with projections beamed onto the upper half of each wall in an ever-changing display. All furniture is white, whether it's high tables with cocktail chairs, low sofas or glossy laminate tables.\n Just off the restaurant the VIP bar looks like a James Bond-esque snug - all black leather around a circular bar and curved walls. Up the curving staircase are the egg-shaped toilets that everyone raves about.( see pics uloaded). Yes - they're cool, but slightly unnerving to hear applause or Ave Maria sung by choirs on completion of your time 'en oeuf'. Apparently the sound effects differ per pod and the lights strobe through the full rainbow spectrum so you get a different experience at different visits.\nNow, on to the food. \nLuckily, with all the pomp and pretention, the food is still excellent. We tried the set menu ( which seemed to have some kind of apricot theme throughout! )\nI tried baked pollock on a bed of aubergine and a square of apricot jelly-esque side spread. This was followed by the rib-eye steak, done to perfection as a medium-rare, with vegetables and a polenta cake with some whipped, cocunut frothiness on the side. Finally a cake concoction stacked with diced apricots, apricot sauce and a brittle, nutty disc on top. All in all, a great food standard peppered with friendly and prompt service.\n I think that the main reason this place has stayed 'de rigeur' for more than 6 years is more down to this level of attentive and professional staff and high-quality food than to the 'quirky' or trendy styling."}, "1254": {"rating": 5, "review": "Sketch is a Bar and restaurant just off Regent St. This Establishment never fails to give you the wow factor from it's ever changing Gallery Restaurant (This has different artists to commission unique digital and traditional works and themes) to the excellent East bar that is housed in a dome with great atmosphere and the craziest most unique toilets that you will ever encounter.

Let me say this much - the place is very large, with different rooms with different themes, and so much to look at that it borders on the distracting (but in a decidedly good way). First, I'll say the one bad spot regarding Sketch ... the service is a little erratic, and sometimes takes a while to get noticed if you're drink is needing replacing or you need extra attention to your meal.  That being said, let me move onto what I can describe as the magic of Sketch!\nWe got seated proper at 8.30 on a busy Saturday evening in the Gallery Room, and the maitre-d was an incredibly charming French gentleman who said everything with a insouciant flourish of his well-manicured hands and his impeccable smile. A giant lamp made out of children's toys and action-figures and dolls painted entirely white is by the entrance. Near the coat-check is a porcelain statue of two mating greyhounds. In the entrance is a hopscotch painting in the floor, and one of the doors off to the left appears to be melting, cascading thick red resin down a petite flight of stairs. Outside is a merry-go-round of \"out of work\" ashtrays that spins and empties themselves into a urn. Cathy and I were seated next to a softly lit wall set in the centre of the room that was impaled with chairs, pieces of antique tables and chandeliers, and one of the first things we noticed was the projections of the Paris skyline rotating slowly on the upper parts of the walls. A DJ was spinning some wicked house music with a lot of bass, and everybody was beautiful.\nWe ordered a bottle of Veuve Cliqot, which arrived quickly, and received two little shot glasses of a vegetable puree which was then poured over a little shaving of raw tuna with something that resemble lentils. Cathy's entree was a little radicchio salad with slices of Chilean Sea Bass and a balsamic vinaigrette, I went for more of the tuna!\nMain courses came a bit later. I dropped a knife once and a server caught it as it bounced off the floor, and immediately replaced it. Good reflexes! I had a rib-eye steak bloody with dauphinois potatoes and leeks, whilst Cathy had a fish dish I can't remember.\nAfter we had this blowout piece of lovely hot chocolate cake, I took off to the toilets. All I can say is ... WOW. You go through a door in the back and you see in the centre of this massive room a small dugout bar surrounded by two semi-spiraling staircases that envelope the bar as they go to the next level. One is back-lit blue for the boy's toilets, and the other one is pink. You ascend the staircase, and come across these pods that look like escape pods mated with the transportation pods from \"The Fly\" and the eggs from \"Alien\". The door opens with a gentle hiss, and closes behind you. Everything is bathed in a soft blue (or pink if you're a girl) light, and gentle soaring sounds surround you as you complete your business.\nI recommend saving some space in your evening for a last glass of champagne in the little dugout bar when you've finished with your meal.  It's rather small, and looks like something out of \"Star Wars\". The gently domed ceiling is covered with little sketches, the bartenders were friendly, and a single portal in the centre gives way to the blue/pink lights from up above near the pod toilets.\nA very interesting, fun, and fabulous evening, I highly recommend it!"}, "1274": {"rating": 5, "review": "had tea (actually champagne and cakes)  in the parlour.  what a cool place.  lovely calm atmosphere.  relaxing.  cute manageress and really helpful staff! should be for the price I spose :)\ngreat place to go though and we will be back. oh and, of course great loos; ha"}, "1275": {"rating": 4, "review": "I don't have anything in particular to say about the tea, but the scones so good!

They start you off with a selection of bread and butter. Their water was 6 pounds which makes sense for the restaurant to charge that much. Afterwards, they bring you 3 small complimentary appetizers. Their molecular gastronomy techniques are excellent. Hard for me to describe the taste so I will leave photos of them after the review. Next was the 20 oz steak with jalapeno peppers and finely cut potatoes. They wrap a small bundle of rosemary to enhance the flavor of the steak. This steak was and still is, the best steak I have ever had. On the side is their famous smashed potatoes and it definitely has an exquisite taste. Lastly they gave me complimentary desert that was a great palate clenser. All for only 55 pounds. If this was a 1 Michelin Star restaurant, I can't imagine what a 3 star will taste like.

For me, the highlight was the dessert which consisted of \"chocolate wonderfulness\" that defies an adequate description!

We booked a 10:30 PM slot. When we arrived, our table was not ready.  We were sent up to a lounge where we were given menus for cocktails. No one ever came by to take our order while others were being seated and helped. Finally, after 30 minutes, someone came by. He was extremely apologetic and provided us with a complimentary glass of sparkling wine.  About ten minutes after that, and fort minutes after our reservation time, we were seated.\nSomeone promptly came to give us menus and bread.  There were no bread plates, so after several minutes we had to ask.  My friend ordered a diet coke.  The waiter took our order and then a few minutes later someone else came to take our order.\nWe ordered the eight course tasting menu.  My friend's diet coke never came, so after a few courses, we had to re-order. I ordered a cocktail, the Secreta Negrita around the first course. It came around around the seventh course. That was ridiculous. I didn't get it until I threatened to cancel the drink order.\nOur dessert took forever, at least 25-30 minutes after we finished the last course, which was strange because the other courses came out at a nice pace. By this time, people were banging pots and cleaning without seeing if we needed anything. I kept having to flag down people for water.\nWe had the eight course tasting menu.  \nCourse 1: Tempura - This is not your Japanese style tempura. These were fresh vegetables wrapped in a light tempura batter.  Simple and delicious with a light cucumber and mint cream.\nCourse 2: Caviar - The caviar was served over crab with potatoes vichyssoise. This was beautifully plated on a plate with palms painted on it and a bowl of ice underneath the dish.  Very beautiful.  The caviar was on top, and then the potatoes vichyssoise, and underneath was the delicious crab. The combination was superb. \nCourse 3: Seared Scallop - This was beautifully presented on a half shell on top of potatoes mousseline. The scallop was seared perfectly. The texture and flavors were supreme.\nCourse 4: Gyoza - This was a chicken and leek gyoza in a hibiscus broth. The broth was slightly sweet and acidic. It was so good that I didn't leave a drop in the bowl.  The gyoza was my least favorite.  It didn't taste any better than the dollar dumplings in NYC, aside from the soft (vs dollar dumplings' rubbery) texture!\nCourse 5: Foie Gras with a similar hibiscus broth/juice from the previous course. This was my favorite!  It was a generous portion, and it really melted in my mouth, truly a wonderful experience.\nCourse 6: John Dory with a tandoori-lime emulsion. This was my second least favorite course. It was good, but the texture was a bit rough. I never had John Dory before, so maybe that's how it's supposed to be. I really liked the broth, and it came with baby clams.\nCourse 7: I had the lamb cutlets. My friend had the quail stuffed with foie gras. Both came with a mashed potato that was to die for. It was the thickest and creamiest mashed potato I ever had. I had my lamp medium well. It was tender and savory. \nThis was around the time I got my drink, La Secreta Negrita.  It's truly a dessert in itself, a creamy mezcal drink with a chocolate treat inside.  \nAt this point someone put a bowl of the mashed potatoes in front of us and didn't say anything.  Several minutes passed by with it sitting there, so we asked about it. And the waiter said he ordered it by mistake. We gratefully indulged!\nCourse 8: Herb sorbet and kiwi puree with a light Sorbet AND Chocolate Mousse with Oreo cookies.  This was worth the wait. \nOverall, a beautiful venue with fresh vegetables serving as decor and strong red colors that make the ambiance.  The food is divine.

However, The vegetarian courses were quite heavy and complex, but in a way I found overwhelming and \"tried too hard.\" The beetroot and poached quail egg dishes were nice.  \nAside from the somewhat disappointing food courses, the service was very patchy. We asked to see the sommelier a few times before she appeared, a promised dessert wine never came, and courses took a while to come out even when we were the last people there and they were cleaning to close. \nThe worst part was that we saw at least one mouse running about the restaurant. One if the waiters stomped his feet to scurry away the mouse. When that mouse or another one reappeared, another waiter blamed it on the door being left open. The hostess said, \" don't worry madam-- it's a mini one.\"  That statement did not work in their favor. The door was not open and seemed unlikely that the mouse had run in from the outside as this was pretty far into the end of the restaurant and there are two separate doors by the entrance.

It didn't wow us as much, possibly as our bar is always moving higher.  The service, however, made us feel unwelcome.  We were about 10 minutes late to our reservation due to traffic, which we apologized profusely for.  However, I don't think the service thereafter was justifiable.\nThroughout the night we were consistently ignored.  We weren't sure if there was a dedicated server for us, as no one had introduced themselves as we were seated, and several folks rotated on our needs.  It took roughly 5 minutes after we were seated to get a menu.  It took another 10 minutes for someone to take our order (we got the tasting menu).  The older couple next to us had a blast talking with many of the staff, which is great for them, but my wife and I were paid no attention to for drinks or feedback on the food.  At the end of our meal, it again took a long time for the bill to arrive after we had asked, and no one bothered to take away our dishes after bringing us the bill.\nAt some point we wondered if we were ignored because we looked younger or because of our ethnicity (we saw other tables also ignored according to a pattern), I'd rather not assume discrimination so we'll chalk it up to just bad service.

The location is in the heart of tourist London, but L'Atelier is hidden in a smaller street so it's not crowded.  \nAll the foie gras dishes there are really good and perfectly cooked.  I especially liked the lobster dumplings with foie gras sauce, since the lobster was really sweet, the foie gras sauce gave it just the right amount of bitterness it needed.\nI also really enjoyed the veal steak.  It was also cooked to perfection and was tender as fuck mate.  They have a sommelier there if you dont know your wine shit, but make sure you are specific when you tell them what you want otherwise they just gonna suggest the most expensive shit.\nWould probably come here every time i go to London because french food is bomb AF"}, "1319": {"rating": 5, "review": "Utterly incredible.

The food was good, don't get me wrong. However, the food wasn't great, and for the money that we paid to eat here, we expected and should have received great. \nWe ordered a range of things from the menu including the foie gras, scallops, miso cod, and lamb. The foie gras was done excellent and so was the lamb. Surprisingly, the best part about the lamb was the mashed potatoes that came with it. Unfortunately, the miso cod was very average and we have had much better. However, the biggest letdown were the scallops. The presentation was beautiful (as it was in every dish), but they smelled and tasted fishy, to the point where we couldn't even finish them. They were also in a very harsh flavored sauce that did not go well with them at all and couldn't even cover up the fishy taste enough to swallow them. \nI am happy we tried L'Atelier after hearing so much about it, but I highly doubt we would go back after the mediocre experience we had there."}, "1322": {"rating": 5, "review": "This might be my new favorite restaurant.

We started with crunchy spring vegetables in tempura that was a perfect light first course.  The second course was a crab royal with vichyssoise and caviar.  It was basically parfait of vichyssoise with delicious crab at the bottom and topped with caviar.  It was excellent.  The third course was a seared scallop and was lovely but suffered by comparison to our crab.  The fourth course was a chicken and leek gyoza that was excellent in a tasty broth.  The foie gras course came next and was excellent with fresh cherries.  We then moved onto the black cod that was good but set the stage for our main, the lamb.  The lamb was excellent and flavorful.  For dessert we had mango with a passionata sorbet followed by a herb sorbet with chartreuse cream.  \nAll in all, a wonderful meal and even if you dont eat some of the things on the tasting menu, I would suggest you go for it.

I am 110% satisfied with the experience I had here. Right when you walk through the door, you're greeted by a friendly host who gladly checks your winter coat. I came here for lunch yesterday with a friend and we both had an amazing time. The atmosphere is dark, dim, and especially trendy. I loved the back where the wall is covered with tree leaves. We were seated at the bar, which was lovely because you can see everything the chefs are doing. Every dish is carefully crafted and none reach the table unless it looks absolutely perfect. And yes, it tastes as good as it looks.\nIt was lunchtime and a prix-fixe menu is available with a few options at different price points. We opted for the one-starter or dessert and main entree for \u00a328. We both went with starters and a main entree.\nStarters\nL'\u0152UF DE POULE - Poached egg in a crispy rice batter served with black truffle &Iberian ham; This was incredibly delicious. My friend said it reminded her of hash browns & breakfast, which isn't a bad thing at all.\nLE C\u0152UR DE SUCRINE - Heart of lettuce with chicken breast, crispy bacon & parmesan shaving; Very light, but still very tasty. All the elements of a caesar salad, not the most unique dish but still very good nonetheless.\nMains\nLE CABILLAUD - Cod fillet served with flat parsley ravioli and vegetable broth; Very light and flaky but very tasty. The vegetable broth was amazingly flavorful, the fish was steamed cooked to perfects, and the ravioli cover gave it a nice touch.\nSPECIAL OF THE DAY, PORK FLANK - This isn't on the menu, but it was most definitely the best dish we ordered. The pork was tender and juicy and packed full of flavor. It was one of those dishes that with every bite you take, you roll your eyes back and savor each bite. Yes, it was that AMAZING.\nNot only did we have an incredible lunch, but to add to the already amazing experience, the service was just as good. I guess I shouldn't be surprised given this restaurant has 2 Michelin stars, but the waitstaff kept bringing us little sides throughout the entire time. Compliments of the chef, we received an amuse bouche to give our tastebuds a teaser, fennel & mashed potatoes as sides for our entree, and a little dessert to end our meal. We spent a good two hours in here and we were never rushed out even though we sat and stewed for a while after our meal was over. \nI'm a big fan of this restaurant and I'll gladly say that this was one of the best experiences that I've had at a restaurant in London.

I can't wait to come back next time I'm in London!"}, "1335": {"rating": 4, "review": "Regular Tuesday evening at work and a senior colleague declared that we would be doing a 'spontaneous' team dinner after work. I volunteered to organize. Knowing the nature of the people at dinner, I knew I needed to look at the top end of the range - Hakkasan, Galvin Bistrot, sketch, L'Atelier de JR. Amazingly, sketch and this place had seats available - the bosses preferred good food over funky atmosphere, so we settled on L'Atelier. \nFree team dinner at Michelin restaurant - yes, please! But oh no, I have some medical restrictions for a few months on alcohol, raw food and delicacies like caviar and foie gras - oh so sad (What a strictly upper middle class first world problem :P)\nWe were seated upstairs in a dark gallery with dimmed lighting, stylish decor and a view of the kitchen. We provided plenty of logistical challenges to the restaurant between my dietary constraints and one of the party arriving 45mins late, which upset some of the rhythm of the multi-course menu.\nAfter some confusion, we finally placed our orders. The tasting menu comes in 5-/8-courses with two different types of wine pairings (Sommelier's choice vs. French pairings) - we decided to brave the 5-course menu with Sommelier's choice(not for me!)...but as I started reading through the details of the menu, I realised I could have almost none of the courses without replacements, so despite the \"strict\" rules about the entire table ordering the menu, I was allowed by the chef to order off the 'small tasting dishes' menu. The other alternative was to order off the vegetarian tasting menu but frankly, what's the point? \nAfter running into foie gras in the most unlikely places, I finally picked 4 small dishes (with dessert to follow!) to keep pace with my colleagues' 5-course menu. A nice balance of veggie, pasta, fish and meat with non-alcoholic drinks.\nVerdict:\n1) Spiced Carrot Juice - excellent. Light, gingery, quenches thirst perfectly without overwhelming the palate or weighing me down.\n2) The amuse bouche with port reduction, egg etc- hmm, oh yes, readied the palate very nicely for a grand meal afterwards\n3) Slightly smoked aubergine caviar with vegetables and spicy tomato coulis - Tangy and sour from the tomato coulis, just the way I like it, the aubergine was of a smooth texture with crunchy veggies to balance out the creaminess. I like.\n4) Capellini with tomatoes and a m\u00e9li-m\u00e9lo of crunchy Spring vegetables - a cold dish of stringy pasta in tomato sauce presented pleasingly with a range of veggies. This was certainly the most underwhelming dish of the evening for me. It made me wish I had gone for the lamb, cod or crabmeat instead.\n5) The Apple Mint Soda took a while to materialise, some chasing was required - I liked the first few sips but soon, it was ghastly in its sweetness and it overpowered my palate and appetite so much that I had to drink water to wash out its flavour before eating\n6) John Dory fillet on a tomato reduction with avocado vierge sauce - I hadn't had a dory in a long time, so I enjoyed the dish. It was a bit more-ish which is perfectly fine as I was starting to get a bit full. I would venture to say that a tomato reduction is a fairly strong flavour, not always ideal with fish, but this worked. In the future, I'll keep in mind not to order two dishes (aubergine caviar and this) in the same range of flavours - both dominated by the sourness of tomato\n7) Gyoza of braised veal shank with spinach and harissa - This definitely felt like a 'main'. For one, there are 4 substantially sized gyozas where one might expect 2 or 3. Also, the meat is bursting with flavour and tender, so you can't just inhale it without noticing the quantity. The gyoza was made perfectly, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. \n8) The bread basket was fabulous!\nAha, dessert. While the rest had to go with their menu-dictated choice (something boring with raspberry), I could pick from a wide range, and I decided to go for the Warm Guanaja chocolate souffl\u00e9 and Sicilian pistachio ice cream, despite their warnings that it could take 15-20mins. It didn't take that long and oh my gosh, definitely the highlight of the meal! The souffle was the BEST I have had in life. It was light as air, the chocolate was dark and intense, the texture was flawless...I almost didn't notice the pistachio icecream because I couldn't get over the souffle, ooh la la.\nI noticed my colleagues enjoyed a wide range of wines from various regions, including an unusual Riesling from Luxembourg. \nSo. Why the 4 stars, and not 5? Well, when my dinner costs a small fortune (over 700quid for 4 of us, and I wasn't even drinking), I would like to not feel like I'm inconveniencing the chef through my dietary constraints. If foie gras is merely a garnish in a dash, can they not exclude it? Even chain restaurants are happy to customize so this was unexpected. Service was friendly but a bit confused. Even so, excellent place and quite an experience!"}, "1336": {"rating": 3, "review": "It must be me. Or maybe they were just having an off night.  I have eaten at amazing restaurants all around the world and people talked about L'Atelier like it was the second coming or something. I thought it was just OK. \nFirst of all- there is a ton of pretense. I can be as pretentious as the next person but there was attitude abounding in this place. First the reservation. We called a month in advance and still could only get a 9:30 seating. We got there early and were seated in the upstairs lounge drinking very pricey cocktails until our table was ready around 9:45. \nA quick note on the lounge as it was quite lovely.  There is an outdoor area with the walls covered in ivy.  Inside are several grouped seating areas- one around a large fireplace with leather sofas and chairs.  We grabbed a corner table relaxing in the club chairs that surrounded it.  Another nice touch?  They put down black napkins for your drinks and adorn them with a red rose petal.  Very classy.\nOnce our reservation was called, because there were 4 of us- we were not seated around the kitchen which is the norm (allows patrons to interact with the chefs)- but got one of the very few tables in the place. This place is small. It gives the illusion of being bigger than it is with mirrors on every wall but I think there may have only been 4 or 5 tables in the whole place. Most of the seating is at the counter where you can see the food being prepared sort of Japanese style. \nService was SLOW- slow even by European standards (I get that everyone thinks we Americans are always in a rush but we were hungry!) And our server kept commenting on our choices as if we should be ordering something else. \nThe menu is broken down into two areas- smal tastings on the left facing page and entree sized portions on the right. But don't think you can share the tastings.. These are little tastes. If you want to share- you need to order more than one- and at these prices . . .it adds up fast. \nWe ordered a variety of the tastes: soup, john dory, squid, mini burgers, the salmon (which never came) and the egg cocette. We also ordered the beef tartar from the entree side of the page. While most were good (forget the egg cocette if you want my opinion and order more of the john dory- now that was good!) this was not food I was going to rave to people about. Nor would you be full. Four people split the above and if not for the bread- we would have walked out hungry. \nBut since one in our party had been there before- we had a special treat for dessert. Picture a ball of chocolate (About the size of a softball) filled with fruit and ice cream. At your table- they then pour hot liquid chocolate over it which causes the shell to break apart and reveal what is inside. This was the highlight of my entire dining experience and truly unique. \nI would have a hard time recommending this place to friends as I think for the money there are better places to eat in London. Those that know me, know that I am not on a budget when I eat out. But I also like to think that the place that I am spending my money wants me as a customer. I didn't get that feeling here at all.

Actually, it's probably my favorite restaurant in London! However, I should point out that compared to the locations in Paris and New York, I found this branch to be slightly behind, quality wise.\nFor my meal, I had the the beef carpaccio, the langoustine ravoili, and the beef and foie gras burger with caramelized onions. \nThe carpaccio was scrumptious, lovely cuts of meat simply complimented with gorgeously flavored olive oil, garlic and chives. The langoustine ravioli was very good, but it didn't blow me away. I could barely taste the langoustine and the portion was so tiny I didn't get much of a second chance to try and search for more flavor! Finally, the burger was good, but a bit of a disappointment. The flavor of the the foir gras was outstanding, but the beef was a bit non-descript, and overall, as a concept, it just didn't work for me. They also gave me an \"order\" of fries, that had about 4 fries in it. I realize you go to a Joel Robuchon for the taste not portion size, but c'mon! Four f****** fries?\nFinally, I just want to note that our waiter (or whatever you call the guys within the Atelier) was a bit obnoxious when talking to us, quite a contrast to the other Joel Robuchon's we dined at where they exude professionalism. I wish I got his name, but since I didn't Ill just say that the guy was coarse and made a few inappropriate jokes which I felt had no place in this type of environment.\nOverall, definitely four stars, but surprisingly, not five due to slightly disappointing food and an oaf of a waiter.

Even upon entering the interior of the sleek restaurant with Asian-inspired decor, I still had no clue. Let's face it, I googled it just before I began this review. According to the free dictionary (yes, had to use the free one because it turns out places with apostrophes in the name are as expensive as they sound), L'atelier means \"A workshop or studio, especially for an artist or designer.\" It all fell into place when I read that... \nWords to describe our experience and the food at L'Atelier: Superb, fabulous, wonderful, delicious, beautiful, surprising, gorgeous, yes-I'll-have-a-dessert-even-though-I'm-full-and-will-be-late-to-my-west-end-show-licious. First off, the service was wonderful. Not stuffy or overly formal, but friendly and extremely professional. I do think the Frenchman delivering our food may have amped up his accent just a bit to play the part of the French waiter, or it could be that in contrast to my ridiculously English boyfriend, it stood out. Disclaimer: The sommelier was also helpful and accommodating with regard to the price range we felt comfortable with. \nThe food...scratch that. The Food (yes, it has to be considered a proper noun - it's that good) was spectacular. We began with a rich amuse bouche and a basket of 3 types of wonderful bread - traditional baguette, savoury olive bread and a sweet fig bread. If I could have bought a loaf of each to take home, I would have. We opted for 4 courses. I went a little egg crazy and got a cheese souffl\u00e9, followed by a crispy poached egg served atop parmesan mousse. A CRISPY poached egg! How does that even happen? I was sitting there while they made it in the open kitchen and I still have no idea what frankenstein science was used! All I know is that I want it to happen over and over again. I had duck for the main and it was every bit as delicious as I could have hoped. This is where my only criticism comes though - the orange sauce that came with the duck was far too sweet for my taste and reminded me of a melted down hard candy. I just ate around it and enjoyed the duck in a slightly purer form. I was, however, reminded of the time when my dad was making a \"new recipe\" which was \"orange chicken\" and when we didn't have real orange juice, he used Sunny Delight instead. We ended up eating pizza that night. \nMy boyfriend was equally as happy with his dishes - a lobster salad with a very generous portion of lobster, a shitake chicken broth and a 'spit roast of the day,' which happened to be lamb and (surprise) happened to be delicious! We were also given a complimentary pot of the smoothest, creamiest mashed potatoes either of us had ever had. Despite running short of time, we decided to squeeze in dessert because, well, we are greedy, disgusting gluttons but it somehow seems more acceptable when it's not burgers and nachos... We had the same - chocolate fondant with a mint sorbet. No points for creativity here, but from the first bite it was obvious this had been perfected and shouldn't be messed with. \nThe really outstanding thing about this restaurant is that they so artfully prepared ingredients, we each enjoyed things we otherwise wouldn't have touched with a 10 foot pole. Case in point: My boyfriend hates eggs so much that I had to get a hysterectomy (ok, not that much but you know...). He ate and ENJOYED the savoury cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e amuse bouche. (*sorry Ed, you ate eggs. I didn't want you to spit your food up at this civilised establishment so didn't tell you).  I hate sea creatures and am actually scared of them. This probably all goes back to when I got sea lice as a kid but that's another story for another time. I ate a piece of lobster and didn't even flinch! Neither of us particularly like olives, we pounded all the olive bread like it was the last bread on the planet. \nL'Atelier is one of the best restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of dining in. It's clear that there is a real passion for food, art and creativity here. It's front of house is well managed and they even walked us down the street to get us going the right direction to the show we were attending. It's not cheap and it's not everyday fare, but it's worth every penny and great for a special occasion or a good ol' fashioned splurge.

They offer two tasting menus (either 5 or 8 courses), both available with or without wine pairings.  They also offer items a la carte, including both small plates and entrees.  Like most places, they expect all members of your party to do either the tasting menu or a la carte but not a mixture.  We ended up ordering a la carte and asked the sommelier to pair wines with each dish.  The sommelier totally nailed the pairings.

The first floor restaurant was less busy, and we were told to have the same menu and food as the downstairs - L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.  \nThe 2 of us had 8 dishes to share, and created our own tasting menu.  The bill including 3 cocktails, which were also very tasty, came to GBP138, which I thought was reasonable given the great food and the Michelin 2-star status.\nThe night before we went to the Gordon Ramsey Maze, and the price was about the same, and the food was terrible in comparison to the food here.\nDefinitely worth a visit."}, "1360": {"rating": 5, "review": "I had my Graduation meal there last night with my parents and my partner and I can't even find words to describe how amazing it all was.\n Firstly the cocktail list is very intelligently put together and I had an apple sour that had a shot glass full of Moscato Jelly! The textures and the sweetness offset the sourness of the apple cocktail beautifully. It was so clean and refreshing on the palate and very well mixed so there wasn't such an alcoholic back draft after each sip.\n The Rooftop bar too made all the difference especially in this hot, sultry weather. It was tranquil up there as well as nice and cool. L'Atelier is seriously one sexy place in terms of decor as well as everything else.\n If you want to take someone here to impress them then this would be a sure fire way. From the moment you enter the doors to the moment you are seated, the place seems to do a good job in seducing you in every single way.\n The food is a great concept too. We opted not to have the tasting menu on account that there was a bit too much Foie Gras in it (3 dishes had it in there) and we wanted to sample the other things a little more.\n My only criticism is that I felt that the tasting menu lacked imagination to provide 3 dishes with Foie Gras and before anyone states the obvious, I know it is a French restaurant in essence!\n That aside I felt between us we all chose well. We had a crab guacamole which was delicate and very beautifully presented, scallops and squid that were cooked to absolute perfection - I have never had squid melt so gently in my mouth. If this was to be a food erotica gastronomical moment then I would have sent my taste buds to Coco De Mer to be whipped, teased and tingled to a culinary orgasmic afterglow.\n There was another scallop dish too which had a baby leek, caviar, gently seasoned seared scallop and a lovely buttery lemon sauce that was like eating a slightly savory equivalent of something like lemon curd. It was delicate and gentle but gently cleansed the palate against the salty caviar. I could have eaten that dish a million times over.\n We tried the little hamburgers that had some foie gras and to go with that we had a lovely bottle of Pomerol. It is my absolute favorite red wine ever and it was so smooth it would have given James Bond a run for his money. For our mains we had Black Cod that was divine, some Veal that was beaten and topped with a salad and the veal was so good and so vegetarian friendly that it was more than suitable as a veggie option for one of our open minded members of our party.\n We were also served a delightful pot of mash that was so velvety and rich we literally found ourselves licking the pot clean. The french really know how to make potatoes taste good!\n We also had cheese, which was nicely ordered and slightly strong that was accompanied by some rather divine walnut bread.\n But for me the Chocolate Profiterole with vanilla ice cream and chocolate shell was the most amazing dessert ever. They poured chocolate over a chocolate shell which made the sauce that covered the profiterole and to say it was fantastic would be a complete understatement of the century. I rarely eat chocolate desserts either but this is going down as the best one I have eaten ever!\n There was also a yuzu mousse that was zingy and that was accompanied by a raspberry sorbet as well as a rum baba and meringue sphere that was accompanied by a 'multivitamin' sorbet which I suppose was there to make the diner feel a sense of some health after consuming the delicious calories offered.\n But saying that when you go for a dining experience like that it is about the food and the calorie counts will go out of the window.\n I would definitely go back again and it was certainly a graduation to remember!"}, "1361": {"rating": 4, "review": "Jo\u00ebl Robuchon is kind of a big deal, as he's pretty much the most well-respected chef of his generation and was named \"Chef of the Century.\" He's got restaurants all over the world, most of which have one or two Michelin stars. The two-starred London location is right by Piccadilly Circus, and upon arriving for my 1:30 pm seating, I took a seat at the bar, which is set right in front of the open kitchen. After placing my orders for the \u00a328, three-course lunch prix fixe menu, I was served an amuse bouche, which is another thing about fine dining that appeals to my inner cheapass (more food!). Consisting of a spoonful of a potato-fish pur\u00e9e, the amuse bouche tasted very much like a white fish spread, and it was a tasty first bite. Served a bread basket consisting of white, wheat, and olive breads, I found myself going back for the olive bread again and again. I must have gone through four or five pieces of the olive bread before my meal was done; that's how good it was. And also because, well, unlimited bread!\nFor my first course, I went with what the waitress described as one of the restaurant's signature dishes. Described as \"Egg cocotte topped with light wild mushrooms cream,\" this dish was mind-blowingly good, and it's no wonder that it is a signature dish. A soft-poached egg nestled in a bath of creamy soup along with mushrooms and asparagus slivers, this was the highlight of the meal and had me using bread to sop up every last drop of soup.\nMy entr\u00e9e, described as \"Razor clams fricassee with confit tomatoes, sweet onion, and macaroni,\" (pictured at top) was like a refined version of a pasta dish that you'd find at The Cheesecake Factory. I don't say that to slight the dish, but it just wasn't as creative or elaborate as the other courses I enjoyed. The creamy sauce actually tasted very similar to a vodka sauce, and the razor clams were cooked nicely. While I usually am not a huge fan of cilantro, I found the cilantro-bread crumb mixture on the razor clam shell to be quite refreshing.\nFor dessert, I ordered the \"Fresh strawberry and pistachio cream cake with mascarpone ice cream.\" The beautifully-presented dish was just as appealing to the taste buds as to the eyes, as the moist interior of pistachio cake was really quite tasty, especially when paired with the fresh strawberries and sweet ice cream. I wasn't particularly crazy about the outer pastry layer, which I found to be a bit tough, but everything else about the dessert was superb.\nWalking away from my meal at L'Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, I can say that I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food and service, which was friendly and helpful throughout the lunch. Okay, so perhaps the restaurant would be better served by not applying foam to nearly every dish, and \u00a328, or about $45, is definitely close to the maximum amount for how much I'd be willing to pay for a three-course lunch prix fixe, but all in all, I was quite pleased with my lunch. Whereas Restaurant Week prix fixes tend to be disappointing and underwhelming, year-round prix fixe deals at restaurants like L'Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon mean that there's no need to fight the crowds and muck your way through mediocre food. Overall, this is a good-value prix fixe that gets my recommendation."}, "1362": {"rating": 4, "review": "The food was mouth watering as was the preparation and delivery.

This kept us entertained as we watched the kitchen staff put together our meal.  \nFor my starter, I had the warm asparagus salad with nuts and iberian ham.  It was well balanced and tasty.  My dining partner had Scottish salmon carpaccio, which I enjoyed more.  It was both refreshing and texturally interesting.\nFor the entree, I had the roasted cod bouillabaisse which sat atop a potato disk.  The bouillabaisse was really nice, with just the right amount of seafood flavor.  The fish was cooked expertly and I enjoyed the texture of the potato in the mix.  Our other entree was the braised pork belly, mild spices and served with celeriac mousseline.  This was very rich, unexpected in flavor, and all around enjoyable.\nLastly, the highlight of the meal was the dessert - Coulis and mousse of mango, Joconde biscuit and exotic sorbet.  The different textures of the mousse, sorbet and biscuit made the perfect, fruity, not-too-sweet bite!  I loved it!\nI felt extremely satisfied after my meal here and can't wait to go back and work my way through more of the menu (and maybe re-visit that mango dessert)."}, "1364": {"rating": 5, "review": "There is really only one experience from my first year in London that is worthy of my 100th review.  We went to L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon back in March when we were first getting our feet wet in the London food scene.  Of course, I've been writing and rewriting the review, and it's been sitting unfinished in my account for nearly a year now--what can I say, I have an amazing talent for procrastination.  I wasn't sure (am still not sure) that I can do our experience the justice it deserves.  So, without further ado... my best London food experience of 2010.\nThe hubs and I made a pact that our time in London is going to be one of great experiences.  Chalk the first one up for Mr. Robuchon, one of the greatest culinary minds in the world.  We went to London's L'Atelier for my birthday in March. My husand has been to the one in Tokyo several times, and absolutely adores it.  We were seated near the far end of the sleek and sexy bar on the ground floor.  I was a little perturbed that we hadn't been seated in the empty seats smack in the middle of all the action.  My mind was quickly changed.\nNearly every seat at the bar has an amazing view into the kitchen.  Sitting to my right was a very well dressed Frenchman chatting it up with the sommelier.  Next came another European couple that took the two seats next to my husband.  Both impeccably dressed... the girl about twenty and the man somewhere in his late-40's.  Of course, I suspected the worst.  But after a couple glasses of champagne, we discovered that they were actually father and daughter, and the guy was Robuchon's business partner.  At which point, Robuchon made an appearance from the rear of the kitchen. He chatted with us for a few minutes. We mainly discussed the amazingness of the Chicago dining scene (he's tried repeatedly to open a place in Chicago to no avail--please keep trying! is all I have to say to that).\nAt this point, the evening becomes a fairly booze-fueled, and rather surreal experience.  We started the meal with the menu decouverte with the wine pairings.  This, however, was derailed after a few courses, because having made friends with the Monegasque father-daughter pair and the impeccably dressed Frenchman, who turned out to be one of Robuchon's most regular customers on the face of the planet--hey, if I could afford it, I'd make this place my own personal Cheers, too!--suggestions on what to try were made.  And wow, best, recommendations, ever! \nWe ate rounds of butter-laden mashed potatoes and wondefully divine truffle dishes. The Frenchman was our ticket into samples of amazing, 20-year-old, first-growths served by the awesome Bulgarian sommelier. Of course, then he introduced me to \"Francois' Yuzu Souffle\". There really is nothing sexier than a Frenchman talking about souffles. And of course, Robuchon's pastry chef, Francois is a super crazy diva--a man diva, but a diva nonetheless. The man wears sunglasses in the restaurant and hits on the gorgeous women sitting at the bar in his spare time. Like I said, man diva. Anyway, it was one of the best things I have ever consumed. Done so perfectly, it was absolutely incredible. I cannot even do it justice talking about it. You'll just have to try it for yourself. \nBy the end of the evening we had an open invitation to hang out in Monaco; a Polaroid with Joel Robuchon, that my husband proudly displays on his desk at work; and a bill that could have been far worse than it was (it was still the most expensive meal I've ever eaten). It was hands-down the best dining experience I've had in London so far. And while I can't promise anyone else the same experience, it is still my favorite fine dining restaurant in London, and my first recommendation to out-of-towners looking for a great experience. Robuchon is one of those chefs who wants his diners to love food as much as he does. And that in in itself is what makes this place so brilliant."}, "1365": {"rating": 5, "review": "If you love Fois Gras, and amazing wine, and service, and ambience.. in fact; if you like food - you will LOVE this place!

Which means that :\n1) they take reservations.\n2) you can wait in the lounge if no place is free!\nFor those who do not know Robuchon:\nHe is the most renowned French chef from the past quarter century. No less. You will not get very rich French classical cuisine. (and definitely not the over-creamy rendition offered to foreigners all over the world). But modern French cuisine at its best. You will be blown away.\nFor those not familiar with L'Atelier :\nSimilar restaurants been opened in Vegas, Hong-Kong, Taiwan and Tokyo. This is not the flagship 'High-cuisine' Robuchon restaurant ('La Table de Joel Robuchon', Michelin 3 stars), but a more convivial, less formal setting.  The Paris restaurant does not take reservations, for example... this one does.... \nYou will still get a very refined and modern take on some French and international classics. \nA bit like tapas, you get to choose between small 'bites' and larger dishes. Mix and match, as much as you like / can afford.\nThe menus range from the 27 quids 'pre-theatre' offer to the gigantic menu Decouverte. \nThe pre-theatre formula (27 quids) is definitely the best quality/price ratio food you're ever likely to get.\nMy advice is simple.

It has the appearance of a high end sushi bar, but with a warmth that you don't generally find in Japanese restaurants.  The majority of the seating is at the bar with a few scattered tables throughout the downstairs.  I believe the upper levels are all table seating.  I would recommend sitting at the bar.  It is a unique setting.\nThere is an open kitchen that is actually inside of the seated bar, but separated by a small run in which the waiters and sommelier's pour drinks, take your order, and expedite your food.  Essentially, you still see the Chef's working, but you get a real waiter.  The service was spectacular.\nThis was one of the largest wine lists I have ever seen for a small restaurant.  They must have somewhere between 200 to 250 wines available by the bottle.  They have both red and white wines from every major wine region in the world, but (of course-Joel Robuchon) the majority is made up of French wines.  I am not very well versed in French wines so I requested the assistance of the sommelier.  I gave her a very short description of what I like and she immediately pointed us to a 2008 Sancere that was a perfect choice.\nThe first dish was a black truffle and endive salad followed by a scallop carpaccio in lemon oil.  Both were amazing.  The next was a pumpkin soup, it was my least favorite.  I want to be very clear in saying \"least favorite\" as opposed to \"worst\" because even being my least favorite; had this dish been served in 98% of the other restaurants I frequent it would have been the best dish.  We followed with a lobester ravioli with savoy cabbage and a foie gras reduction, which was flawless.  Finally, we had black cod with a cauliflower puree (it was the tits)..\nNo flaws to be found anywhere in the service, atmosphere, or food.   We ate at \"Gordon Ramsay at Claridge's\" the previous evening.  That restaurant was good, but not great.  It was what happens when a really great chef is no longer in the kitchen; some laziness in the dishes.  The best dishes at Ramsay's were the off menu amus bouche and pre-desert.  IThis had me greatly concerned when we went to Joel Robuchon's the next night.

I had a country terrine with fresh bread, pickled mushrooms and redcurrant chutney, followed by haddock and mussels with pasta and a shelfish sauce.

How else would one be able to regularly dine at Michelin starred restaurants in London without for instance being a stock broker (before the credit crunch) or a professional footballer? One of these restaurants is L'Atelier de Joel Robouchon in the middle of the theatre district in Covent Garden just next to The Ivy which offers a 2 course set menu for 22 pounds, 3 courses for 27 pounds. The French chef Joel Robouchon who has achieved more Michelin stars than any other chef (25 if Wikipedia is to be believed) has restaurants all over the globe. Two of these stars are held by the London joint of L'Atelier Joel Robouchon. So believe me  my expectations were higher than high and I was looking forward to a stunning meal.\n The restaurant is impressively beautiful. The elegant and stylish dining area is dimly lit and decorated in a red and black theme (I was not so sure about the apples in the big bowl (see below) but what do I know about interior decoration?). There are high tables and bar stools and, around the central kitchen area, patrons are seated at the counter and can watch the chefs preparing their dishes.\n Sometimes the service in high end restaurants can be a bit patronizing but the service at L'Atelier Joel Robouchon was absolutely perfect. Obliging and polite and, when they brought as the wrong main course, three people came one after the other to apologise (which was maybe slightly over the top). Also a very nice touch was that, when the wine we had ordered was not available, the somelier exchanged it with a (very delicious) cheaper one. Even though we 'only' had the pre-theater menu, they did not rush us at all to leave after we had finished.\n Unfortunately the food was not as enjoyable and exceptional as I had expected. Of the 3 starters and 3 mains to choose from a very autumn-style, mushroom-based menu we commenced our meal with Egg Cocotte Topped with Wild Mushroom Cream. The soft-boiled egg was at the bottom of the glass topped with a very tasty mushroom cream. It was nice but did not blow me away and I did not like the consistency too much.\n The second starter also embraced the autumn theme: Wild mushrooms served with Puff Pastry consisted of perfectly cooked, delectable wild mushrooms on light pastry. This was rather enjoyable dish but again not terribly special.\n We choose two different mains: RS really liked The Razor Clams served with White Wine Emulsion and Leek Fondue. I only had a small taste of it, far too much dill for my liking.\n The Crunchy chicken breast with Curry Sauce and Pilaw Rice was rather mediocre. The nicely cooked chicken was too salty and the combination of elements of chicken katsu curry and the Indian influences of the Pilaw rice were not convincing, especially for a 2 star restaurant.\n Now the question is  if you have a pre-theatre/ good value set menu in a Michelin star restaurant, would you expect the set menu to be of the same quality as the a la carte? I do, and L'Atelier Joel Robouchon did not deliver. Does this mean now I have to save and go back to try the a la carte (assuming that the Michelin inspectors know their job)? Or do I just give up on old Joel?"}, "1390": {"rating": 5, "review": "L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon was the best thing that happened to my fiance and I on our recent visit to London. The best thing that happened in our dining experience, that is. Being the foodies that we are, we did alot of research before we embarked on our trip and part of the process involved making reservations at must-eat places before we left Chicago for London. Needless to say, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon was in our must-eat places.\nWe were seated at the bar. Actually, it's not really a bar either since you're not sitting in front of the bartender, but it's a high top counter that allows you to see all the action going on in the kitchen. What a fantastic experience seeing the kitchen crew prepping appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I had baked clams with minced garlic and mushrooms and the clams were served on a thick bed of sea salt. I ordered an entree of spaghetti which will make you think, \"What?! You ordered spaghetti in a 2-Michelin star restaurant? How boring!\" But wait til you hear what the spaghetti came with: sea urchin! Sea urchin and spaghetti = divine. I've only had sea urchin sashimi-style in sushi restaurants and have always loved it. And now having sea urchin Joel Robuchon-style tops it all. The sea urchin was used to make the creamy and there were also bite-size pieces of sea urchin hidden in the sauce. When I bit into it, the texture reminded me of foie gras. I think they don't always have sea urchin on the menu because it seems like they constantly change what goes into the spaghetti. My fiance had fried langoustine, duck liver pate, and octopus salad which he all loved very much. For dessert, we shared the Rum Baba which was absolutely divine. The sponge cake was soaked with rum that you can actually taste very well. in fact, the rum was pretty strong. This was what stood out for me because it's not one of those desserts that claim to have liqueur in it although you can't really taste it. We also got Irish coffee to go with dessert. They have several types of alcoholic coffee drinks, depending on the several countries of origin of whiskeys they offer.\nThe service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and helpful in answering our questions. This place isn't pompous or pretentious at all. You can dress up fancy here or show up in jeans and you won't feel out of place.

It's definitely a little expensive for a 3 course meal, but it's actually not too bad considering the fact that it's a very famous and renowned restaurant.\nThey started my meal with this amazing French onion soup.  The soup was served with crispy cheesy garlic croutons floating on top.  The crunchiness of the croutons was definitely a nice complement to the creaminess of the soup.  For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered their flat iron steak, which was cooked to perfection, topped with caramelized onions, with creamy potato gratin on the side.  I have to say that it was the best flat iron steak I've ever had EVER!  It was tender, juicy, and well flavored.  I could tell that they used very simple ingredients to season the meat because the natural taste of the steak was preserved and didn't get over overpowered by the seasonings they used.  The potato gratin was very delicious as well.  It was very creamy and cheesy, yummy!  At last, they served this chocolate mousse/ice cream thing for dessert.  I still don't know the name of the dessert or exactly what's in it until this very day.  All I know is that the dessert was so amazing that it blew my mind away.

We were given a bread basket to start with, with no butter or oil, the French bread was so stale I would have reservations about feeding it to pigeons up the road in Trafalgar square!

The French chef, who is originally from Lyon in the Rhone River valley, became famous in New York after moving there in the early 80s.  Boulud's centerpiece - three Michelin star restaurant DANIEL is located in NYC - but his empire spans the globe with locations in Florida, Singapore, Beijing, Montreal, Toronto and London. Bar Boulud sits in the ground floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park hotel, one of the poshest addresses in London's Knightsbridge area.\nThe Boulud American-inspired French bistro concept is a majorly relaxed and welcoming environment. And unlike many other restaurants in this price range, it attracts people who aren't dressed to the nine's and just want a chilled out, but very nice meal.  The slightly-underground Bar Boulud is designed to feel like a French wine cellar with vaulted ceilings and recessed, red-leather booths.  It's open kitchen does make things more lively than your average wine cellar.\nI, of course, had the burger.  Bar Boulud features four delicious burgers on their regular menu, priced between \u00a317 and \u00a324. Now, this is pricey - it's prohibitively pricey.  And considering just a few short years back, the Boulud burgers were priced between \u00a313-19, Boulud has realized that there is money to be made in a delicious hamburger.  \nHowever, I do say that these burgers are worth it - considering the Hawksmoor burger for \u00a315 without fries; Bar Boulud includes the pommes frites, and it's on par with Hawksmoor.  Boulud's beef comes from the Castle of Mey; aged Aberdeen Angus Cross chuck steak (grass and silage fed from the North of Scotland).\nTheir burgers include: the Yankee (\u00a317) - a classic beef burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle on the homemade glazed brioche bun.  The Frenchie (\u00a319) is topped with confit pork belly, tomato, and dijon on a morbier peppered homemade bun.  The Piggie (\u00a319) piles bbq pork on top of the beef patty and then includes jalapeno mayo and cabbage on a cheddar bun.  And finally, the pi\u00e9ce de r\u00e9sistance is Boulud's \u00a324 BB: a beef burger with foie gras, short rib meat, horseradish mayo, confit tomatoes on a black onion seed bun.  \nThey also serve up a sampler of three burgers, cut in halves so you and some select friends can divide your attention amongst these four 8oz. burger delights.  The beef absolutely melts in your mouth and remains the focal point of the experience.  Even though the house-made buns are exquisite, they are purely a bit-player to the beef.  Even the toppings, though fresh and wonderful, are purely there for slight variation, not to overpower the burger patty.\nYou can read my full review here: \nbeeffanatic.com/2015/12/\u2026"}, "1434": {"rating": 5, "review": "Bar Boloud is just amazing.

The texture was divine and there was just the right amount of lettuce and tomato with a delicious burger sauce. There are some more adventurous burgers on the menu, including one with foie gras inside, but I stuck to a Yankee burger with cheese and salad. Not that three bits of lettuce can be included as part of your five a day, but it probably saves some calories.\nSaving calories on the main course is important as you'll want to indulge in a dessert. I had the chocolate lava cake, and held my breath to see if molten chocolate would oooze out as I've had some disappointing experiences with chocolate desserts recently. Thankfully, a river of chocolate flowed over the plate and I spooned up every last drop. A raspberry sorbet cleansed the palate so I could keep going back to the chocolate.\nNot only was the food divine, but the location was a plus. As it is inside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge, which is just down the road from Harrods and Harvey Nichols, I expected it to be much more expensive than what it was. My Yankee Burger was just \u00a318 though so it was cheaper than Burger and Lobster and some gastropubs.

Senior maitre d' Paulo de Tarso, which eventually turned our evening into a special one, told us the origins of the London version from its humble basement beginnings at the swanky Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge\nTo be honest, the evening didn't start well. The first 4 of our party of 10 Yelpers arrived to find that they had split us up into tables of 4,4 and 2 and that they were unable to sit us close together. Having now spent an evening in the buzzing and impressively full dining rooms, I'm still not sure why our tables couldn't be placed closer together\nThe other unfortunate policy at the restaurant is that no photo taking is allowed, especially of the food. At the end of the evening, we all agreed that it was a real shame that they didn't allow us to take photos of the food, which was beautifully plated and presented. A little bizarrely, they did offer to let us return to photograph the food with professional photographers and they would set up the food professionally, which rather goes against the spontaneous joy of Yelp. I really hope that they re-consider this policy as I, in common with a lot of others I'm sure, have chosen to eat somewhere when we've seen the beautiful photos of the food\nHowever, once Mr de Tarso worked out that we were serious foodies, he did put in a lot of time with us to share his obvious passion for the food and to make sure that we had an enjyable evening. He was the perfect host\nWe had some nice cocktails to sip on - my non alcoholic 'Exotic Breeze' was a nice combination of lychee juice, fresh berries and tonic - as we perused the menu\nVery generously, Mr de Tarso sent over some complimentary charcuterie boards as he wanted us to try the terrines, which reflects Daniel Boulud's rustic origin and style of cooking though elevating it to perfect execution and appearance. Despite it having a bistro air in the dining room, they don't skimp on the quality of the ingredients or cooking\nThe many terrines and hams on the board weren't shy on flavour, which was nice. The mustards served alongside added some lovely bite but the pickled veggies could have had a little more zing\nBeing Burger Quest, we all went for burgers. I had already decided beforehand on their signature BB burger which is a beef patty, foie gras, red wine braised short ribs, truffle, fris\u00e9e, horseradish mayonnaise and confit tomato all on a sesame black onion seed bun, costing a reasonable \u00a319.50 considering the top class ingredients. Yinnie C bucked the trend on our table by having the Piggie burger, which was personally recommended by Mr de Tarso\nSo, the BB. It was very good but just a couple of notches from perfection. The beef patty is made in-house with a carefully measured ratio of fat to meat and this results in a wonderfully light patty. The foie gras and short ribs were nice too but as all these main filling ingredients are of the same consistency and flavour, everything just merged into an amorphous mouthful, nice though it tasted. I felt the foie gras was wasted in this mix and extracted it to be eaten separately. Similarly, the truffle was a bit lost in the meat feast. Linzi M had requested no horseradish in her burger and I did wonder if they leff it off mine as well as it did lack a little bit of different texture or a a little kick, which would have elevated it into the great division\nHowever, Yinnie's Piggie burger was a little star. With the addition of barbecued pulled pork and chilli mayo, it had interesting contrasts on the palate\nHappily, the truffle in the truffle mash was more obvious and was my favourite side. The fries, mushroom fricasee and cauliflower cheese gratin were good fillers but not in the same class\nSomehow, we found space for a dessert each. These were yummy. We had a nice range with pineapple souffle, chocolate tart, peppermint chocolate sponge and mango with orange mousse\nMr de Tarso had a last surprise for us with a batch of mini madelaines fresh from the oven. Though we were stuffed by then, these all disappeared and I even spotted some fellow Yelpers pouring chocolate sauce into them!\nSo a big thanks to Mr de Tarso for being a perfect host and making our visit special"}, "1450": {"rating": 5, "review": "This was my best restaurant experience during my recent trip to London.

My water glass was never empty and our bread basket was always full of a delicious mix of fresh, warm, breads. \nI had the fruit de mer grilles--a mixed grill of scallop, octopus, prawn, heritage tomatoes, lobster croquette, and basil mayonnaise. For dinner I had the volaille rotie-- a chicken breast perfectly prepared with polenta, roasted peppers, feta, charred courgette, and harissa vinaigrette. For dessert (of course I had dessert!) I had souffle baie des ronces--an incredibly light raspberry souffl\u00e9 with thick tangy raspberry jam in the bottom of the ramekin and a side of fresh, nutty pistachio ice cream. \nOthers in my group tried the sole limande--a whole roasted lemon sole with brown butter and lemon and capers (it's typically served on the bone, but she requested it boned and it came completely boneless). And one person had the Prix Fixe 3-course meal and adored every course. \nEverything was perfect: the atmosphere, the temperature in the restaurant, the staff and service, the timing of the meal, the drinks, the food (OMG the food!), and the desserts. \nI am dying to go to the Bar Boulud in NYC now and cannot wait to go to London and eat at this Bar Boulud again. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful."}, "1451": {"rating": 5, "review": "Clean and classy with top quality food and a suckerpunch of a 5 star customer service experience is exactly what this restaurant is all about. \nAmbience/D\u00e9cor:\nThe way in which I can describe the ambience and d\u00e9cor within this restaurant would be of a subtle nature. The restaurant (in my own opinion) is in a league of its own with having the ability to be well lit, calm, peaceful and down to earth, yet also possessing the qualities of having an air of elegance, class and of high quality to it's list of ways to describe the experience and memories it leaves with you.\nFood/Dessert:\nDue to having a semi full stomach, I decided to skip the starter and head straight for the main.\nFor the main course, I had one of the notoriously talked about burgers, the \"BB\" burger which consisted of: the beef patty, foie gras, red wine braised short ribs, truffle, fris\u00e9e, horseradish mayonnaise, confit tomatoes and black onion seed bun. I can honestly agree with all past reviewers about why the burger is London's best. The beef patty, foie gras and the ribs all complimented each other. The burger had a unique and overly satisfying taste. It is of decent size, packs in a lot of ingredients, flavours and good quality beef patty with it being filling, yet won't leave your stomach bursting with agony. I would definitely  recommend this to anyone who knows about good quality burgers.\nFor dessert I had the 'Coulant Au Chocolat' which consisted of a chocolate lava cake, raspberry sorbet and vanilla milk. What a collaboration of flavours and textures. This dessert is just one of those desserts that is better tried than described. The warmth and sponge like texture of the cake with the flow of hot chocolate mixture pouring out of it is to die for. It is sweet well baked and having the raspberry sorbet on the side is definitely a plus. The raspberry gives you a wake up call and definitely shockwaves your tastebuds back into action with it cold temperature and raspberry sour kick flavour. Great portion and really closes the meal in the best way possible. \nPrice:\nI guess there is not much to say really apart from you get what you pay for. What I can say though is if you want a meal that is like an experience then that is sure what you are paying for. On the plus side, I didn't think the pricing was expensive at all and the food was by far definitely worth it.\nCustomer Service:\nIt is rare to receive such customer service that has you talking about it for days. The waiters & waitresses really show that they care about ensuring you get the best experience possible. The waitress who served on the day I attended was very informative about the menu, very patient and engaged in general conversation. Customer service is just one of those things tjat in order to understand, you have to experience ir yourself, but, being an active restaurant diner, I have seen my fair share of customer service and yet still, when you receive a new moment of excellent customer service it does leave you in awe.\n***Non-pretentious, chic, elegant and top quality restaurant serving top quality food with the sprinkle of excellent customer service in a modern building in the heart of London is where you need to be. Bar Bould is the restaurant where you need to be.***"}, "1452": {"rating": 4, "review": "Burger Quest 4.0 has descended upon Bar Boulud and have also left with lighter wallet. The minute we walked in, it was clear that these people were serious about their food, and they only seem to serve tables of 4 and under because it means it is more intimate. So as a party of ten, we split into 4,4 and 2! Also no photos of the food please. It is THAT serious and crazy classy. \nThe Maitre d' Paulo de Tarso (who has a 'small' following of 200,000 followers on twitter) was lovely, he talked to us about the beginnings of Bar Boulud and how passionate he was about the place since, he has a major hand in opening and managing the place, starting from it's basement origins. \nWe also had the pleasure of trying the charcuterie board, and I totally agree with Linzi M, the foiegras and lamb terrine STOLE the show on that board. The Jambon Ham was also quite nice. They also had a pork and parsley terrine and a rabbit terrine as well. (Veggies look away!) \nThen, the burgers came, the beacon of our travels across, uhm, London. 3 BBs and My Piggie Burger. Although I did sample their shortribs and foiegras on top of their patty and it was so rich and so good. I polished off my piggie burger is fast timing too. The Chilli Mayo on top of my pulled pork and beef patty with the sour tang of the red cabbage slaw lifted was was a good burger to a great burger. It had a kick, it was medium rare and it had the extra juicyness of the pulled pork. AND I DIDN'T GET ANY ON MY WHITE TOP. WIN.\nSince we pretty much shared EVERYTHING on the table, the sides were no different. But,the sides were hit and miss, which is why I had to knock a star off. The fries weren't great, B+L does better chips. The Mushroom fricasee, had great flavour but was really oily at the bottom. The great sides were the truffle mash,and the cauliflower cheese gratin. \nWe went ALL OUT, and ordered desserts. And, the desserts were special, like Linzi's Peppermint chocolate dessert is something I'll order again, it's got a really unique taste, and it worked so well. and it came with hot chocolate sauce. LOVE! Yee Gan's Souffle was super super light and hot pineapple and coconut ice cream ALWAYS works. The chocolate tart that Andrew ordered was decadent and I'm glad we shared! My mango saffron crumble was light but the biscuit at the bottom really changed the dynamics of the dessert. I got dessert envy from Linzi's dish FOR SURE. \nAnd the madeleines, how could I forget the ones that were BETTER than paris. These were light, and fluffy and just too cute. AND added bonus to the staff who showed me how to the do the basket. (3 times 1 side and 2 times the other and then pull up from the bottom) Don't judge me, I am an origami freak!\nI am meated out though. Beef Patty/pulled pork/meat board.

The calamari was both tender and flavorful and that aubergine was good to the last dot on the plate.  \nI followed that with a single Merguez sausage served with red bell peppers sauteed with a moderately spicy harissa sauce and also served with a yogurt mint sauce.

They were light fluffy and warm.

I opted for the Piggie - beef burger with a pulled pork crown, but I was a little disappointed as there really wasn't that much piggy in the Piggie and certain not enough to make a difference to the taste. Still, the beef was as I requested it, a gorgeous medium rare, could have perhaps done with a little more seasoning, but overall nice cow.\nNeeding to wash the cow juice from my hands I popped to the ladies and needed to walk through the restaurant, and who was drinking in my form, but a German ginger sports man.

He was truly a delight, highly knowledgable and treated us like family. We discovered Paulo is a more than a bit of a respected  celebrity in restaurant circles so it was lovely of him to spend so much time with us describing his ethos for the restaurant and how much attention goes into each dish. \nWe started with the charcuterie board and were won over by the flavours of the terrines from lamb terrine to coarse country foie gras. As always cured meats are my favourite, I couldn't get enough of the different flavours and textures of this board. Try them all! \nAs was the theme of the evening, everyone ordered the burgers, 3 BBs and a Piggie. We had to go for all the sides, truffled mash, mushroom fricassee, cauliflower gratin and of course, fries! The burger was a revelation, the most moist, tender patty you could ever bite into. I wasn't relishing enough enjoyment from the foie gras in the burger, so I began spreading it on the bread provided and that was divine! Back to the burger to really taste each part then, the highlight of the BB is the combination of the braised short rib with the foie gras sitting on an unusual black sesame seed bun.  \nSides are almost always my favourite, maybe because I used to be a vegetarian. But I could have eaten that truffled mash all day long. It was decadent! Same for the gratin. \nOf course, we were a greedy table and ordered a round of desserts. At a place like Boulud, how can you not?! Coconut crusted pineapple souffl\u00e9 with coconut ice cream, this was like eating a fluffy delicious cloud of air. Andrew had the coffee and bittersweet chocolate tart - this was decadent and divine. Maybe too rich to eat a whole one, but I was too taken with my coupe peppermint, a flourless sponge topped with mint chocolate icecream and a chocolate 'lid' that melted when poured over with chocolate sauce. Hello! \nPaulo then treated us to fresh baked madeleines, straight from the oven. What a delight.

It's a beautiful simple room with nice warm colours and very friendly and attentive staff. Speaking about staff, the sheer number of staff is almost scary, but as all are very obliging, I did not really mind.\nI started with a really great Trinity Hill, Viognier, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand 2008, a delicious white wine that reminded me a lot of dry Rieslings. \nFor the food, I chose the Frenchie burger. To be fair, it is not a very large burger. But that's probably a good thing. I agree with many others, this burger deserves a mention in any top list. The taste is rich, the bun doesn't dissolve half way through the burger and I cannot think of much that would make this burger better. The Pommes Frittes, as they call it, are thin and crispy, well seasoned and a good complement to the burger. \nThe strawberry dessert was simply amazing, the pastry  that was mainly for the eye anyway, but nice and crunchy  even came with some gold on top! Whether it was gold or not, you clearly pay for it. But I have to say, it's worth every penny! \nTo finish off, I ordered an espresso. I didn't expect too much, and I didn't get too much. It is really a pity, that almost no restaurant offers decent coffee. So unfortunately, the last impression was by far not as positive as the rest. \nAfter all, I definitely recommend Bar Boulud.

A little 'scene-y' on the weekend, loud, but dependable for drinks and some good food."}, "1489": {"rating": 4, "review": "Bar Boulud is pushing the bar for burgers in London just for a bit higher with some innovative creations, epic attention to detail that really shines through in the taste and texture of the meat, and a high level of service to back it up.\nBar Boulud was the location for the latest Yelp BurgerQuest, picked for its appearance on several top 10 lists on London's burger blogs and the fabled BB burger topped with foie gras and coming in just shy of \u00a320. It's a posh place (located below the Mandarin Oriental Hotel) with a suitably luxurious d\u00e9cor. It's burgers are no less fancy with all four offerings being based on a bespoke beef patty. But is it any good? The short answer is yes, yes it is. From the Yankee to the Frenchie and of course the BB, the burgers are very tasty with one of the best patties in London and a solid set of buns to support them.\nTwo important things we learned are 1) groups of more than 4 need to book several weeks in advance to have a chance of sitting near let along with each other, and 2) NO PICTURES!\nAnyways, we eventually got seated and the night properly began. Our waiter was pretty cool and, despite being fairly new, really put in a lot of effort to make sure we had everything we needed and also answer all the questions we threw at him. Mr. de Tarso also spent quite a lot of time with us over the course of the night to discuss his vision for Bar Boulud and also a bit of his personal history. He's worked with some of the top names in London and is a fairly impressive chef in his own right. \nAt this point, I need to disclose that we didn't have a completely typical experience as Mr. de Tarso was kind enough to send some free charcuterie plates (as they say, you really know a chef by how he puts together a plate of meat) and some fresh madelines for dessert. Now I'd love to think it's because we demonstrated an obvious passion for food and thus inspired Mr. de Tarso to ensure we tried the best Bar Boulud had to offer. But, the smart money is on the fact that we let slip at the start that we were all Yelpers. If the latter is the cause, I attribute it to Alex S's (Yelp London Community Manager) efforts to really put Yelp out there above its competition. Regardless, there was free food, and it was good.\nThe BB burger is average sized with a fluffy soft white bun, the aforementioned patty, seared foie gras, and red-wine braised short rib. It's a bit tall and may prove a challenge for those who can't unhinge their jaw, but each bite is full of tasty meat and soaked bun. I give extra points as the bun actually holds together for the entire burger despite the copious amount of juice running out with each bite. The foie gras was delicious on its own but was lost in the taste of the combined burger. At best, it added a bit more richness to the whole thing but it was a poor value-add. The braised short rib was likewise a bit lost in the overall combination although it did add more textures to the burger which was sorely needed. I could have eaten it as a side dish alone though, absolutely brilliant flavours and tender shredded meat. Overall, a pretty good burger but not quite worth the nearly \u00a320 price tag. At \u00a312-15, I'd be quite happy and perhaps if they took off the foie gras they could do just that.\nFinally desserts! We started with the mini-madelines as ordered by Mr. de Tarso which were brilliant. Light and airy with a slight lemony flavour, they are very moreish and incredibly hard to put down. And when you dip them in hot chocolate sauce then you pretty much won't bother stopping until they are all gone (I know that's what I did). The chocolate tart was my next favourite with a  deep bitter chocolate although the chocolate sauce soaked sponge was a close second (or third rather). Finally, for a bit of freshness, we managed to take down a pineapple souffl\u00e9 and a mango mouse. Both were light and refreshing and a great option if you feel stuffed from your meal but still want dessert.\nOverall, an excellent experience and a definite burger win. I only wish we could have taken some photos but perhaps Mr. de Tarso will be kind enough to send some professionally taken ones for us to use. Get over to Bar Boulud (make a reservation first), and try the the Piggy or Frenchie burger for a good time. And a special thank you to Mr. de Tarso for being an absolutely brilliant host - he even got a waiter to teach us how to fold a napkin into a bowl for serving madelines!"}, "1490": {"rating": 3, "review": "Summary: Decent food, nice setting, small portions, not as good as I'd expect for the price.\nCame with two friends late Fri. night - I ordered the boudin noir (blood sausage), frenchie burger w/ spinach, and we split desserts.\nBoudin noir was small but great.

Batiste, my waiter, introduced the special (the lamb burger) right after handing me the menu and helped me choose a nice wine to go with it. I also asked whether I needed to order a side to go with my burger order, and he said, no, as he thought the burger was quite 'significant' in size. I'd read a couple of reviews that said the burgers were a little on the small side but as Batiste mentioned that the kitchen could turn out sides in double-quick time if I thought the burger wasn't big enough, decided to just go with the burger.\n And a good thing I did! I'll just say that the burger didn't look that big, but I had to take a break midway because I was getting really full! The lamb was good, not gamey, while the chickpea fries were a delightful surprise.\n I really wanted to give the desserts a go, but, as you might have guessed, that simply wasn't possible. Contrary to popular belief, sometimes, there simply isn't space for dessert.\n I mentioned it earlier but I simply need to mention it again. The service is incredible.

The cheese on the bun was strong and gave a great pungent bite to the beautifully soft pork and then the firm burger. The lettuce, mayo and slaw added softness, heat and crunch so there was lots going on in every mouthful.

The atmosphere was very nice, posh, contemporary with a dash of NY flavor (just like the one in NYC). It was good to be able to share a nice meal with my parents, who only visit London once a year, and who do love a good meal every now and then. \nWe did order from the Prix Fixe menu along with the token burger just to try it out and assess what the fuss about Daniel Boloud's burgers are all about. I still remember starting with the French Onion soup au gratin and the Coq au Vin for the main. The food and service were absolutely delightful and I would have given it 5 stars back when we were Boloud virgins.

I had a grilled chicken breast with creamed polenta, all were very tasty, and the grilled chicken was done almost to perfection... I've never thought I could have had chicken breast that moist. Anyway, I devoured that sucker, but got to the last piece, and with grilled chicken, if you want to get it this moist, it almost has to be just at the right temps. I must have gotten the fleshiest part of the meat on my 3rd slice and it was just a little too underdone for me. So... being the perfectionist that I am, I sent it back (oh for shame!!)...

Bar Boulud has been written up to death (e.g. MarinaMetro, AA Gil, Jay Rayner, and a myriad of bloggers) so I will keep myself short.\n The owner and chef, Daniel Boulud, is a successful restaurateur in New York where he doesn't only have a restaurant with 3 Michelin stars ('Daniel') but is also famous for his up-market burgers .\n For me  coming from Austria  burgers did not exist until I moved to England apart from in the form of McDonalds hamburgers. It took me quite a while to get my head around the fact that a burger should be taken seriously and can be truly delicious. So the burger slowly made its way from being my favourite hangover food to actually being eaten for real enjoyment even without prior alcohol exposure.\n Anyway, what I want to say is that my burger experience is limited and I am far from being a burger expert  so I approached Bar Boulud and its famous burgers (which I of course had to try) with a relatively unbiased attitude but with high expectations.\n For Knightsbridge and for being in the Mandarin Oriental I thought the atmosphere at Bar Boulud was rather pleasant and it was frequented by a mixed crowd. It was Wednesday evening and very busy  we only got a table in the bar area (with stylish but hugely uncomfortable chairs). In fact it was so busy that we were more or less ignored by the waiters for the first part of the evening. Later on service picked up however and the waiters were friendly and seemed to be doing their best.\n I started with the beetroot salad with goat's cheese and walnut (8). I was not terribly impressed actually. Everything, even though tasty, was slightly underseasoned and especially the salad leaves could have done with some kind of dressing.\n Then of course the DBGB Yankee burger (12 + 1 for cheese). Maybe I expected something like an orgasmic burger experience (which might be too much to ask from pour Daniel Boulud) but somehow the burger failed to induce any culinary arousal. Don't get me wrong, it was quite nice. The meat was extremely high quality and perfectly medium rare as requested. It was however bordering on cold when served and in the end it was just a not very exciting burger and I was a bit disappointed."}, "1512": {"rating": 1, "review": "We have been so far to three Daniel Boulud's restaurants and this one at Mandarin Oriental hotel was the worst.\nIt was our first and last visit there mainly due to overpriced menu, intimidating staff, noise and absolutely ordinary food.\nThis place does not have any identity whatsoever and definitely does not to live up to Daniel's reputation."}, "1513": {"rating": 3, "review": "Where: Bar Boulud, The Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Knightsbridge\nWith whom: The Masticator\nHow much?: \u00a3110 for the two of us. That was four courses (Prix Fixe plus an extra charcuterie course)\n This was the week that we got news of another American import, Keith McNally, bringing a feted and famous New York brasserie to London (Balthazar, in partnership with Richard Caring's Caprice Holdings). Both McNally and Daniel Boulud, at whose new London outpost we were dining, are considered by many to be American chefs, and both made their large reputations there however both were born in Europe, Keith McNally a few miles up the road from his planned new home.\n I came to praise Daniel Boulud, but instead walk away strangely unsatisfied. As a dining experience overall, it wasn't one that will live long in the memory. \nIt wasn't the staff. They were as well drilled, knowledgable and friendly a brigade as I've seen... \nIt wasn't the decor. The light, well proportioned space is a graceful place for the well heeled to dine... Admittedly I was less sure about the arty splashes on the wall. The blot art of famous red wine vintages intrigued but were only vaguely reminicent of blood stained rorchach drawings. \nSadly, and more fundamentally, it was the food.\n We went for a so-so Corbier, fair enough, but a little too earthy for both of us. It came from a large and excellent winelist priced squarely for the Four Seasons clientele. There are only a handful below \u00a350, the rest quickly hit hedge fund levels.\n The relatively long and involved menu presented a thrill as it was knowledgeably announced by our gallic host. There were certainly sparks of excellence here. Themes of charcuterie, sausage, p\u00e2t\u00e9s and burger were highlighted and so we decided to go for the Prix Fixe with an additional charcuterie course (supplied by expert Parisian charcuterie supplier Gilles Verot). The small plate was more than ample and made a very good pre-starter paired with a moreish (light in texture but richly flavoured) boudin blanc sausage and its accompanying garlic mash. A very good salami made up for the dry and too subtle ham. P\u00e2t\u00e9s (particularly the tagine dagneau, a heavily spiced Maroc influenced lamb and aubergine mix and a superb p\u00e2t\u00e9 grand-m\u00e8re) really excelled and the portions of the small plate were the ideal way to sample.\n The chilled pea soup was simple elegance and one dish I'll remember for a long time. Fresh, creamy and with an occasional snap of tiny rosemary flavoured cruton, it hit the spot perfectly.\n Sadly it went a little down hill from here. The Masticator's burger was initially dry, tasteless, unseasoned and lukewarm with a shredded lettuce, 'special sauce' and thin, limp tomato combination eeriely remenicent of a certain golden arched chain. Only a tasty brioche bun saved it. The team were swift to offer a replacement due to the temperature but this arrived in the same state (albeit warmer). The chips were inedibly saline.\n My roasted chicken breast had a rich rustic and flavoursome taste of pure perfect poultry and arrived, in comparison, piping hot. Slightly dry too though sadly, it was helped by a rich (if salty) gravy but badly let down by rather floury fingerling potatoes and overcooked artichokes.\n The Masticator had further problems with his desert (though this time arguably of his own making). A pervading scent of lavender that put him off his two (small) scoops of mint and coconut ices was tracked down to the overpowering handwash in the Mandarin Oriental bathroom. That aside, a powder dry hazelnut cookie didn't add to the experience. My exotic fruit sundae was preceded by a long spoon hightening childish anticipation before it arrived in a Martini glass. A pleasant but not earth-shattering m\u00e9lange of passion fruit pur\u00e9e and cream came with nuggets of an excellent coconut macroon to give some needed bite.\n Will I come again? Absolutely. It's a great space for a business lunch in the area, a safe menu overall with some excellent notes and very good charcuterie. It isn't somewhere I'll be rushing back to though. For the price, I'd rather take a day trip to Paris and pop by Gilles Verot's shop in person."}, "1514": {"rating": 5, "review": "This is such a fabulous find in London.

I've enjoyed many wonderful meals at every single NYC restaurants of hison many occasions. I got engaged at Daniel and my last meal on earth would be at Daniel. (DB's fine dining restaurant on the Upper East Side, NYC.)\nMy husband and I had many excellent apr\u00e8s-theatre dinners at Bar Bouloud in NYC, so visiting Bar Bouloud in London on a similar occasion seemed like an obvious choice. (Besides, we were curious to try one of the latest additions to the DB Empire.)\nBar Boulud London is very much like Bar Boulud NYC. On steroids!! They have a capacity to seat AT LEAST 200 ppl. (BB NYC has about 75.) Similar menu (with old time favorites like the \"Frenchie Burger\" and \"Coq au Vin\" and artisan sausages) with very similar decor and similar winelist but that's about it. Granted, we went there on a Friday night, but BB resembled a nightclub where they happen to serve food. (That's a serious mistake as Daniel's food is normally as good as it gets. At least in NYC.)\nI'm not sure if it is the culprit of the location (BB is very unfortunately nested at the Mandarin Oriental at Knightsbridge) but it is the service (from the hostess all the way to the sommelier) that seriously kills it. Honestly, the service could not be more clueless, rude and snotty even if they tried hard. So un-DB. (Truth must be said, the guy who looked after us seemed quite pleasant and I was just thinking to myself, he doesn't really fits with the rest of them.)\nIt might be London, it might be the Mandarin, it might just be the particular night we were here, I'm not sure. To be honest, I'd never come back to find it out considering how many wonderful choices there are in London. What a disappointment."}, "1516": {"rating": 3, "review": "Popular casual dining that's known for its burgers and sausages.

He can lay claim to being the chef patron of many an acclaimed restaurant and his 3 Michelin starred Daniel in New York (a darling of The New York Times - it has received 4 stars from 3 successive critics no less than 5 times since 1986) was recently ranked 8th in San Pelligrino's World's 50th best restaurants. (The Greedy Diva had a solid but slightly less dazzling experience there in 2008 - which I'm sure has The New York Times thinking twice.) And now Monsieur Boulud has pitched his flag in the heart of London. I had my table booked before you could say \"steak fri...\".\n While M. Boulud was born in Lyon, which plays a heavy influence on the food at hand, Bar Boulud has a swanky, New York feel (the music on it's website says it all).\n Sister to New York's Bar Boulud, the London bistro decor is intended to be a modern interpretation of a wine bar. Elegant, sleek and sexy, there's a zinc bar, oak panelling and wooden floors (intended to be reminiscent of wine barrels), chandeliers, and swathes of red leather (intended to \"conjure the warm depths of a delicious Burgundy\" - the hint was lost on me at the time, but I suppose I get it in hindsight). Overall, the decor is fairly understated - it's not going to bowl you over before you taste anything.\n The classic French bistro menu holds much to allure. We took longer than usual deliberating over so many appealing options - the Boudin Blanc truffled white sausage with mashed potato is calling me, but so is the beetroot with horseradish and hazelnut, the fish soup and the coq au vin. But then what about the signature charcuterie plates from renowned charcutier, Gilles Verot - such as the Lapin de Garrigue - Provencal pulled rabbit, carrot, courgette and herbs terrine? Tempting.\n In the end, we opt for the \u00a320 menu prix fixe (we'll come back again if we like it), before my deliciously oaky Marsanne steals the last shred of my decision making ability (Andre Perret, Marsanne, Vin De Pays Des Collines Rhodaniennes 2007 - \u00a36.50 - absolutely lovely).\n I start with the luxurious rabbit terrine with cornichons and cocktail onions, toasted bread and a hearty mustard. Elegant and wantonly good, the 2 Frenchmen on the table next door have a serve each, then order another to share. Oui.\n The Peanut Gallery starts light, with the Salade de Roquette - rocket salad, garlic confit toast, stewed tomato, tapenade and buffalo mozzarella. Each element is nice enough, although, not surprisingly, there's nothing here to showcase the kitchen's real strengths. TPG is pacing himself. I'm still in some shock over his choice here, but if we're looking for that silver lining, it certainly gives us just one extra excuse to come back for a face to face with the Boudin Blanc. (Can you tell that it's still playing on my mind?).\n It's hard to go past the chance to devour a New York style burger - it's been a while. We both order the DBGB Yankee Burger - a grilled beef patty, iceberg lettuce, tomato, sweet onion, sesame brioche bun, cheese pickle and fries (\u00a313 with cheese on the a la carte menu). In this price bracket, it's got to compete with my beloved burgers at Hawksmoor and Goodman. It does.\n It might be the messiest thing I've eaten for some time (think shredded lettuce in a train wreck), but this baby is the closest thing I've had to that much sought after, but highly elusive, US style burger in London. It's reminiscent of Shake Shake (and this, for me, is a mighty accomplishment). But it's loftier, even if there's a little too much foliage. The meat is loosely packed, moist and sumptuously flavourful and mine at least was perfectly cooked to the recommended medium. Surprisingly, TPG's patty was a little more well done than mine. (But I still didn't share). The accompanying thin cut fries were are good as they looked.\n On the a la carte menu, the Frenchie Burger comes with confit pork belly as well as the beef patty and there's a Piggy Burger with a beef patty and BBQ pulled pork. While these other combos sound tempting, the flavour of the beef can really sing in the classic DBGB Yankee burger.\n Quite satisfied, I could eat no more than 2 scoops of refreshing mint ice-cream and a decadent chocolate sorbet. More could be made of the sugary biscuit in between if they're going to bother at all.\n TPG finished with the Gateau Basque - custard cake with brandied cherries (\u00a36). The cherries packed a strong punch, but the custard cake itself was boring and dry with a hint of orange that didn't succeed in lifting it out of the doldrums. Disappointing.\n Next time, I'll be trying the freshly baked madeleines (\u00a34 - if they're the same ones we had at Daniel, they're divine) or the macaroons (\u00a35) - among other things.\n We finish with a sweet Domain De Trapadis, Rasteau 2007 (\u00a39) (rich, grape juice"}, "1519": {"rating": 3, "review": "The food was only average.

I had anticipated that the place would have the same menu as in New York (a yelp review being the reason for the expectation) but sadly the London establishment didn't have a brunch menu at all. So my friend and i had to settle for a French lunch.\nThe place is classy ... you feel the elegance everywhere. One thing i noticed was the extraordinarily high staff to table ratio. We had a reservation for 12 noon when most of the tables were empty. So we did see dozens of staff members just whiling away with apparently nothing to do.\nWe went for the set menus ... the two course version costs \u00a316 while its \u00a320 for three courses. For the first course both of us had terrine made of leg of lamb. The dish was borderline raw meat, and i am not a big fan of meat that is not well cooked. But this one was great. Minced lamb has always been one of my favourite foods and to have a brilliantly made meat loaf made of it was a great experience.\nFor the main course i had a tagliatelle pasta with lamb bolognese. I was surprised as i was under the impression that bolognese sauce was invariably made from beef. However this variation proved to be a very good choice. The pasta was excellent. My friend had a dish of chicken breast. The chicken looked dry but was actually quite juicy, and it was served with cubical pieces of bacon. Every dish had been interesting so far ... i was beginning to love this place :)\nI had a glass of Greek white wine (my little contribution towards helping them tide over their debt crisis) while my friend was \"persuaded\" to order an expensive red worth \u00a314 per glass (he asked for suggestions ... he deserved what he got). The red was thick, with a strong odour. The white was milder. For dessert, i had a Muscat de Rivesaltes, which was quite good, while my friend went for the chocolate ice-cream (a safe option ... you can't screw up chocolate, can you ?).\nInitially i had thought that the portion sizes were small ... but i was wrong, proven by the fact that i was full at the end of the meal.\nThe service was excellent, right from taking my jacket to returning it. We did finish our lunch quickly, in less than one hour and a half, but unlike some of the other reviewers here, i never felt rushed. With drinks and service, we paid about \u00a337 per head. Based on the location and ambience, i am sure they can charge much more. We did save by going for the set menus, but even a-la-carte wouldn't have cost much more as many of the main courses were priced in the teens.\nAnother interesting aspect of Bar Boulud was the many options that i found in chicken and lamb. This is a French restaurant which even my parents would like (they don' t eat pork or beef).\nI thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. Next time i plan to try some of the American dishes (mostly burgers and steaks) on the menu.

I've eaten a lot of dim sum in my lifetime all over California, and this place is a solid \"I would take my family to eat here if they visited London\" recommendation. The cost to eat here for 2 people was less than half of what I paid at Yauatcha. I will be coming back to Joy King Lau, but never returning to the other place.\nRecommended:\n- Har Gau (steamed shrimp dumpling). Delicious flavor, fresh-tasting shrimp\n- Pan fried turnip cake.

Per the waiter's recommendation, we ordered a tofu with seafood plate which had a decent serving with a lot of seafood in it. \nThe food was a little cold. I don't know why.

Get there on time minus 10 minutes. They start letting people in at ~11:50.\n2. There are no dim sum carts. You get a special menu and order from that. The menu includes most of the solid favorites. \n3. The crowd in this restaurant is mostly Asian, but not only.\n4. Prices are average.

Dim Sum in Soho - look no further! Joy King Lau on Leicester Street (adjacent to Lisle Street) offers a fairly large menu of steamed & fried dim sum, including some more exotic varieties - and a selection of cheung fun, of course.\nJust returned from London, where I always have dim sum several times during my stays. So far, I mostly frequented the Wan Chai Corner (on Gerrard Street) for its broad selection and solid quality, or Beijing Dumpling (on Lisle Street) for its absolutely freshly made dumplings. The two I will still recommend strongly - but Joy King Lau is different. All the dim sum are made freshly and have a better (firmer, more al dente usually) bite to them than those of the competition. Also, they're about 15% cheaper in comparison to the other Soho establishments, which also makes this restaurant great value! The regular dim sum are just UKP 2.80 per dish.\nThree times I had lunch at Joy King Lau in early to mid-August of 2015 - three times I chose 5 or 6 different dim sum each. This might seem too much for the average single traveler, but I wanted to sample as many different dim sum from this place as possible, having read some rave reviews on the Internet (the reviews here are mixed, which I don't quite understand). Expect 3 or 4 dim sum per person for a tummy-filling meal. They made only 1 mistake, as they served me the regular salty fried squid instead of the squid cakes I had ordered.\nThe atmosphere is quite typical for a Soho Chinese. It's always rush-rush-rush - this is no place to linger with friends for a party, or with a large family on a get-together. OTOH, for a quick lunch or early dinner with a friend or wife, it's great. You can always hang out for chit chat at one of the many pubs in the neighborhood (there's a good Fuller's pub a stone's throw away on the same street). Having said that, the waiters *never* forced the bill on me after I'd finished my meals - I had to ask for it!\nThe fact that Joy King Lau is also a small(!) restaurant tends to add to the atmosphere of slight chaos and rush.\nWhat's less typical is that the service is very attentive - they're always around to fill up your cup of Chinese tea (which you'll get automatically once you've been seated - so pay attention if you don't want tea!). Sometimes too attentive - there are so many waiters and waitresses around it can happen that one hands you the menu, then turns away, then another one steps up to ask for your order - 30 seconds after you've been seated! It may sound like pushiness - but it is not. The waiters just don't pay attention to what the others are doing.\nIf a little chaos does not deter you, the traveler looking for first class dim sum, then you shouldn't hesitate and include Joy King Lau in your Soho roster of Chinese joints. See the photos for the variety of steamed and fried dim sum I had (not a fan of cheung fun, so I can't comment on those). Particularly recommendable are: the pork & prawn dumplings with Chinese mushroom, the fried skin of chicken filled with four delicacies (just called \"Chicken with Four Kinds\" on the menu!), the beef with spring onion and ginger, the spicy beef tripe (not quite so spicy, actually - it's made with ginger), the siu mai (a standard dim sum, but of higher quality here than elsewhere!) and the chicken with Chinese dumpling (Warning: the chicken here is on the bones!). But ALL of the 17 ones I had were of superior to excellent quality.\nThe bill includes a \"mandatory\" 10% service charge. With 6 dim sum + chinese tea + service I ended up with a UKP 20-21 bill. Very reasonable considering the quality.\nDim sum can be ordered up until 5 p.m. (17.00), which is customary in Soho.\nAlmost all of the other guests during my three visits to Joy King Lau were Asian - I always consider that a good sign. Make sure that when you want to have lunch there with 3 or even 2 people that you show up at 12 noon when they open on weekdays, because the small restaurant will fill up quickly.\nPlease have a look at my photos, which also includes snapshots of the menus."}, "1572": {"rating": 5, "review": "Been to a lot of dim sum places across the USA.

With the staff's recommendation, I started off with ebi bites. The ebi bites were brilliantly mouth watering. Featuring shrimp with several spices to bring out their flavor, the ebi bites were a an excellent start an excellent meal. My friends and I chose the Four Meal Drive Big (6 types of nigiri and 6 of maki)  to share, we began with the nigiri selection. I sampled each of the 6 nigiri - the salmon and seared seabass being my favourites. Among the maki selection preferred the spicy tuna and salmon ceviche.

It's pricey so I don't know if I'd be able to come here again unless it was a special occasion, but I was visiting London for a few days and I decided that I wanted to try some good Japanese food. First about the ambience: it's a very modern, sleek, and clean design. I think that if you're a fan of minimalistic design and you like the dim lights, it's perfect for you (I tend to like that kind of design as well). Oh, also, they have beautiful pictures displaying their menu items so it really gets you excited for the food.\nMy friend and I wound up getting three dishes: the rice paper (it's a unique roll with duck), the salmon sashimi, and a dish called man food. My friend got the rice paper and couldn't stop raving about it. It didn't fill her up, but she had already eaten and said that the flavors were delicious. The salmon sashimi was actually my first time eating sashimi and it was pretty good, though I have no reference points so I can't say much about this. My main dish was the man food dish which provided me with a ton of different meat on sticks (duck, beef, chicken) as well as some ribs. All of this meat was fantastic and even though it cost quite a bit, it was delicious and filled my craving for meat. It also came with edamame and rice which was a nice touch (I love edamame).

Of course I had some sticks too, pork belly and sweet potato. \nThe food was tasty, but not that authentic Japanese food (nothing compared to the food I ate in Japan). The restaurant was very busy and very loud! The waiter I had was lovely! \nI probably won't be going back unless my dining partners want to...

I finally managed to get some time and off I ventured out for lunch. \nBeen scoping the menu online so I knew what to expect when I got there and could just order my food. The interior is beautiful, high ceilings, they have two entrances making life a lot easier, beaming with light, nice black tables with comfy seating, and eyes staring at you from the walls. The menu once presented immaculate, the waiters and waitresses are a joy, they give you the best advice and what to choose. The food is presented really well too. \nNothing is amissed. The spicy edamame is the best I have had!! It's so modish, juicy packed with an abundance of flavour. For drink I opted for the rhubarb fizz as it was only 12 noon when I had arrives. \nFor sushi I think I played it a bit safe, I didn't want to overeat and have food left, I don't like leftovers. So I opted for the hand rolls, veggie and crunchy. I'm not usually a fan because of the seaweed but wow these ones are beautiful, the seaweed is not even noticed, packed with loads of flavour and sauce inside till the end. Matched with the Wasabi, soya and pickled ginger I could eat that all day. Only little hitch is that it does make your mouth dry, the seaweed I mean once it gets caught on your lips. But that is so minor!!\nThen I opted for sticks, a variety of mixed yasai yakitori, chicken wing, tsukune and grilled oyster mushroom. I loved them all apart from the wing, even though the skin was nice and crispy, the whole thing lacked flavour. It was just a wing, nothing special which was a let down. However the tsukune (chicken meatball) was delicious, cooked to perfection and could taste all the spices and less of the chicken which is what you want. The vegetables accompanied the meat very well and the sauces of yakitori and teriyaki was perfect and the extra lemon slice goes a long way. \nService was very attentive, always making sure I was ok and the food was up to scratch. I wish I had stayed for dessert but will definitely go back again and be more adventurous and perhaps take a date so can share a lot of dishes. \nPrice is not too bad either, it's a beautiful place. Highly recommend it. \nMake sure you book in advance though, I was lucky to get a table during lunchtime, they were pretty packed!

I live in San Diego CA and my friends from home told me I should check out Sushi Samba but he said that was very touristy, hard to get a reservation and the food at S&S was much better.  Now I eat a lot of sushi and sashimi and I am beyond impressed with the food I had at S&S.\nFirst of all we had a very nice server by the name of Sebastian who was from Denmark, my friend let him know it was my Birthday and he wished me a happy birthday.  He walked us through both menus, took our drink orders and gave us some time to look through the menu.  I could have ordered everything, it all sounded delicious and their menus are mini booklets with a photograph of each option next to the bite and description.  I've never seen a menu like that before, it's a great idea as it makes everything look and sound more appetizing.  We picked out several things we wanted and out of that Sebastian gave us his recommendations and I'm glad we listened.\nWe started with edamame, you can never go wrong with that, we had the plain but they offer a spicy option.  Next we had the tuna tartare which was my favorite bite out of everything we had on this day, it had pine nuts, avocado, was full of flavor and truly was to die for.  Next we went for rolls, I chose the salmon rice paper roll which was a very neat concept and something I've never had before.  It was more of a wrap, it had lettuce, carrots, cucumber and shrimp tempura (light on the batter side) all wrapped up in rice paper and then sliced into 6 pieces.  I personally avoid to many rolls with rice so this was a perfect option for me.  We also had the gipsy big roll which was very good then we had one of the small tuna chilli rolls.\nI wanted more and if I come back I really would like to try their mini sides of vegtables.  From looking at the pictures the oyster mushrooms looked good along with the cauliflower, broccoli and mini corn on the cobs.\nWe didn't have cocktails as we had a busy day ahead but they have a variety of cocktails, beers and non-alcoholic beverages. \nI highly recommend Sticks and sushi for their service, atmosphere, food and my favorite part...looking through their cool menu booklet with the pictures!"}, "1690": {"rating": 5, "review": "For me it's one of the best sushi chains in London and it didn't even open up its first restaurant in London but Denmark. \nEven during the busy Christmas season for our annual Christmas lunch, high quality of food and service delivers. \nWe started with some soy cured salmon with minced shiitake mushrooms. The salmon was beautiful and rich in flavour. The texture was smooth and the minced mushroom was a lovely companion adding more depth and silkiness. An excellent start. \nNext was the Japanese potato salad, a lovely simple potato mash contrasted nicely with the crunchy vegetables of carrots, cucumber and onions. Tasty light and healthy.\nThe salmon and avocado maki were perfect. The rice cooked well and held perfectly when you held it. The flavour of the silky rich salmon shone straight through the roll. Quality right there.\nThe only dish that didn't tickle my tastebuds was the green salad. It was too dry for my liking, too crunchy with the softer quinoa being lost in there. More softer leaves would have been preferred for a more equal texture so the avocado could be enjoyed and played its role.\nAmongst us all we also ordered a  sharing platter from the set menu. We chose the Upgrade platter that came with a variety of rolls and meat on sticks. Beautiful glistening sushi, all so incredibly fresh and the rolls were paired so well with the ingredients it came with too, all perfectly balanced in texture and flavour. So much creativity. \nThe sticks consisted of fresh tender flakey pieces of tuna, flavoursome, herby chicken meatballs and succulent juicy lamb chops. All delightful.\nLast to arrive in the savouries were the scallops in a light kataifi pastry. The texture was amazing. A light crispy pastry incasing a fresh and bouncy scallop with burst of saltiness from the trout roe for that little extra bit of joy!\nDessert could have been the steal of the show itself. All presented beautifully and made with such creative flavours, fusing Japanese and Western flavours together. We had the coconut cake, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, dark chocolate fondant, dark chocolate and sesame balls and vanilla icecream. All delicious and was the perfect ending to dinner.\nI cannot recommend Sticks n Sushi enough. The atmosphere is fantastic, romantic and sleek as well as being child friendly.

It's anomalous to say the least. \nThe wait for the sashimi combo was more than 45 minutes but since I was able to drown my sorrows in champagne it didn't matter too much. The only reason I had to knock a star off was that we were told it would be right out something like 15 minutes in, but ended up still having a lengthy wait.

The tempura shrimp that is in the roll has more tempura than shrimp and was overcooked.  2.5 stars.\n- Yakitori - overall rating 3 stars.

You are certainly impressed when walking in, and equally so (if a bit overwhelmed) by the massive but beautifully photographed menu.  So my disdain for the crass name of the restaurant quickly disappeared... yes for that 1 second I was being a complete restaurant snob. \nAnyway as I reminded myself that I am sometimes partial to a McDonald's cheeseburger we proceeded on our way through a few snacks and a few platters.  The sushi was not bad nor was the teriyaki.  However the more and more I continued through the meal there was this absolute feeling that we were being fed \"Japanese\" inspired food by people who didn't really get Japanese food.  The constant yelling of Irasshaimase in a very un-Japanese restaurant grated on me even more as I put another mouthful of soulless food in my mouth. \nI get that it's Japanese with a Danish touch, and the food isn't bad - neither the sushi nor the teriyaki were bad, a notch above Yo Sushi or Wasabi.  But I'm not going to be conned by the great decor here.  \nFish quality was distinctly average and seasoning was all over the place, often meat would not be seasoned enough and batter would be over-seasoned.  But it's ok the distinctly average fish and seafood would be smothered in a spicy mayo so any semblance of natural sweet ocean freshness was gone, scallops tasted like shrimp etc. etc. Perhaps the most underrated part of sushi is the rice.  I'm sorry but if the rice is not fluffy and bouncy or even seasoned correctly then you shouldn't be charging these prices. \nAnd this is my biggest grief with Sticks and Sushi.  I feel like I've been conned with the beautiful decor and menu.  The food is a notch above your average London high street sushi place (and the quality of sushi in London is not great in general), yes a single notch.  We paid \u00a3120 for 2 at lunch (with 2 beers and 2 cocktails) for very average soulless food.  Staggering!

Firstly, our drinks: the glasses were all wet, and had been garnished with an old lime peel. It really should have been freshly cut. The menus were also dirty, which is a shame because they're so nicely designed! It's just poor attention to detail.\nThe positioning of the tables isn't good. There is not a clear route through the ground level of the restaurant, which lead other customers to squeeze between tables. We really had to keep an eye on our water glasses, in case of rouge butts and elbows! \nSo as for the main event : the food, they have a huge selection, so it felt a bit like ordering from a canteen. The dishes we tried included the scallops, Jerusalem artichoke, sashimi selection and avocado nigiri. The artichoke and crab balls were a bit too salty and the nigiri did not hold together well.

I shared the \"upgrade\" set menu with a friend. For about \u00a360 you got an assortment of rolls, several delicious slices of salmon carpaccio, and skewers of shrimp, chicken and tuna. The salmon in particular with its fusion-y sauce was a highlight as were the rice paper wrapped duck rolls. The skewers were ok but not super memorable; I expected more from the chicken wing skewers. Surprisingly the side of broccoli was amazing, some of the best broccoli I've ever had. I definitely need to figure out how to make it at home. While \u00a360 sounds steep (\u00a330/person), it actually is a lot of food, no room for dessert!\nThere is also a nice selection of fusion cocktails and Japanese whiskeys on offer though they're on the pricey side (Yamazaki 18, a great whisky to try for sure, but at \u00a335 a go is excessively steep).\n4 stars overall, worth the trip even if just to try their Danish take on Japanese cuisine."}, "1723": {"rating": 5, "review": "Well worth the wait for the sashimi.

I believe service and the setting are almost as important as food and it counts in my notation of a place as I find it hard to enjoy good food in a discouraging environment. Well, Stick n Sushi got that admirably. \nWhen coming in you can't fail to notice the interior design. Subdued light, wooden furniture in sometimes funny shapes, dark dark dark (I like dark). It's big on the ground floor and there is even more sitting downstairs. The wooden chairs are comfortable\nYou're welcomed at the entrance by a waitress/waiter. We had the chance to find a table for 4 within minutes but they recommend you make a reservation for they are packed even with so many tables available. It's a hot spot and it's in the heart of Covent Garden. \nOur waiter came to introduce himself. He was jovial, kind and very energetic, we had a good time with him. He even summoned all the remaining french he could find within him to chat with my parents. He was very thoughtful without over doing it. He helped and advised us on the huge menu.\nSpeaking of the menu.\nYou'll find anything and everything from roasted cauliflower, edamame (nicely roasted in a spicy sticky sauce and tasty) and broccoli to teriyaki (meat sticks), nigiri sushis, makis, meat and salads. \nWe tried a bit of everything.\nI had the kimchi, the black cod dragon roll, the shake daikon and the panko breaded duck. I found the kimchi too salty and too full of flavour, but I had wanted to try it for a while. It's fermented vegetables so obviously, it would taste strong. The black cod dragon roll was my favourite and it's worth its \u00a312. Flavours are well put together and it's melting in your mouth. The shake daikon is an interesting concept. It's a maki roll but they replaced the rice and the seaweed with a sort of radish (the daikon). It tastes good without the rice taking the podium on the flavours and it's perfect for those on a low carb diet. Finally, the duck stick was a good surprise as I didn't know what to expect. I have eaten duck in many forms and this one was a novelty. The meat was very well cooked and melting in the mouth, the bread coat was crusty and didn't taste too oily and the wasabi sauce it's served with, perfect. \nI heard same praises from my family as they enjoyed their dishes. \nFor the dessert, we had an assortment of chocolate fondant, cr\u00e8mes br\u00fbl\u00e9es, chocolates and the coconut cake which is the only thing none of us appreciated at all. \nMy brother tried the Japanese soda, which is basically sprite in a Japanese bottle (which does make it funnier), and a french Chardonnay to our taste. Note that they offer a sufficient range of wines from different origins and for a wide pricing range (from \u00a320 to over \u00a350 a bottle).\nIt was a no mistake for Sticks n Sushi.

First impressions were good - a comprehensive menu with a balance of traditional and fusion in addition to great decor and welcoming staff.\nI sat at a high table in the bar area and after sitting for ten minutes figured it was traditional London, requiring me to order at the bar. I ordered a drink and a few minutes later a waitress arrived to take my drink order; turns out there was just a 15 minute wait from first sitting down and seeing a waitress.\nBy that time I had ordered food. I wasn't very hungry so ordered a light meal and the waitress seemed insulted that I was not ordering something more substantial-- I got two small sushi rolls and some nigiri.\nThe food took about 45 minutes to arrive, after needing to ask about the status of the meal from another server. When the food came my server was lightly apologetic.\nThe food was not good. It was bland, the fish was low quality, and the sushi rice was poorly made. The serving sizes matched the pictures on the menu, however, so I was not surprised by the size.\nAfter finishing and waiting several minutes to ask for the cheque, I gave up and paid at the bar.\nAll in all for a light snack, I was at the restaurant for about 90 minutes.\nI will not return to Sticks N Sushi.

So we grabbed one of the platters for the table which included various maki sushi and skewered meats (mainly chicken). Quality of the sushi was rather good. The yakitori was well made as well. These platters are huge, so be warned and bring enough people.

The manager and sommelier made frequent rounds and were very engaging. We had a very annoying dietary restriction that they accommodated beautifully on the fly. The only bummer was that we were the last table before closing, so we didn't get a kitchen tour, which is fine because the last time I had a tour that late, all you could see was a sparkling clean kitchen and a lonely pastry chef.\nFOOD:\nThe two of us each took one of the tasting menus and shared - the only thing better than having one Gordon Ramsay meal is having two! Only one suckling pig course was overworked and weird, everything else was tasty and we cleaned the plates. Most of the food wasn't knock-my-socks-off-keel-over-delicious, but solid. To me, I'm pretty happy with a meal if I can walk away feeling like one thing was exceptional enough that I will remember it - for us it was the foie gras terrine, absolutely the best terrine I've every had. The sorbets were also killer.\nDAMAGE:\n2 tasting menus + 1 wine pairing with gratuity automatically added came out to be ~ $700 USD.

The planning of ingredients merged with platting of choice heightens ones senses boosting the excitement of sampling each piece of artwork(dish).  \n*Get a bottle, not a glass.

This included five glasses of wine for a price of around \u00a3110-130. This price range was specified in the menu. After ordering, one of the servers came up to the table and asked us who is paying for the bill. Then, he opened the menu to the page that listed the price of the wine supplement, and asked us if we are aware of the cost. I was very confused by this - I've never been asked if I was aware of the cost of something I was ordering. It seemed a bit insulting - as if we would not be able to afford the (very reasonable) price. Neither my wife nor I were under-dressed for this occasion of a fancy dinner. I even wore a tie. The service continued to be rather pretentious throughout dinner, as if we were being looked down upon.\nOn to the food. The initial courses were outstanding - the foie gras, the ravioli, and the poached halibut. Unfortunately, the mains were underwhelming. My wife did not enjoy her roast pigeon and I did not feel that the lamb was anything special - definitely not for a three-star restaurant. The dessert was tasty but not particularly memorable.\nThe experience of the cheese course was strange. Our server brought a trolley, from which we could make a selection of four. My wife and I asked our server for recommendations and he asked us what cheeses we liked and did not like. We stated that we did not like bleu cheese or similar cheeses. He insisted that we must try it and placed it on our plate against our wishes. We decided not to make a fuss about it.\nAfter eating and having our table cleared, we awkwardly waited around 20 minutes for the bill. Eventually, we got the attention of one of the servers, who did apologize for taking so long with the bill. We felt that given the price we were paying for the experience, such a wait was unwarranted.\nWhen the bill did arrive, we seem to have been overcharged for the selection of cheeses. The price on the menu was \u00a310, but we were charged \u00a318 each. I did not notice until we have left the restaurant, and going back or calling to complain over \u00a316 seemed unnecessary. The lack of attention regarding billing was a bit disappointing. Perhaps the menus need to be updated if the price did, in fact, change. I've uploaded a photo of our bill, along with a screenshot of the menu from the restaurant's website.\nOverall, my wife and I were not happy with the experience.

Not hovering, but exceptionally cognizant of what you need. They're attentive & friendly, willing to answer questions.\nFood (vegetarian review):  outstanding. And filling. By the 4th course or so, it was getting to the point of uncomfortably full. \nThey have a vegetarian menu that has several choices to piece together a 3 course meal. It does not include dessert- it's an add-on.\nYou can opt to make it a 7 course ('prestige') meal as well, which is pretty much everything on the vegetarian menu (you have to choose between a cheese plate or a soup). It comes with both desserts. \nI'm sure the menu changes, but they did some cool things- I crushed leaves in a mortar w/a pestle as part of dessert, balls of ice cream came out in dry ice, and there were all sorts of crackle-y, crispy things to crunch your way through. \nDress code: \nMen- no running shoes, Vans or Converse. They'll make you change into a loaner pair, and they might not have your size- my husband had to wear a pair that looked like clown shoes. \nLadies- jeans are ok. Same as above. I assume guys can wear jeans as well (nice jeans), but not 100% sure. \nAt the end of the meal, they'll offer to call you a cab.\nGreat experience!"}, "1787": {"rating": 5, "review": "Best restaurant ive been to yet.

Also because i just LOVE foie gras.\nPigeon (3/5): while I do like pigeons and the skin was crispy and delicious... this dish was way too salty. The saltiness overpowered the taste of the pigeon and the other wonderful ingredients.\nLemon yogurt dessert (4/5): i forgot the exact name of the dessert but it was kind of citrusy with some goat yogurt, if I remember correctly.

I don't know how to better describe the service experience. They were constantly buzzing around in this tiny room and I just felt like I had no personal space. The servers were also not as eloquent and refined as I expected from a restaurant of this caliber. At one point, a server poured sparkling water in my glass half full of still water...And it was quite clear that the still bottled water was in front of my glass and the sparkling water bottle was in front of my boyfriend's....So that was strange.

We were lucky to get a table for 2 about 3 weeks before the reservation date as I think there was some cancellation.\nThe restaurant is actually quite small and very intimate.  I was hoping the atmosphere was going to be quite chilled and relaxed.  However, due to the number of people in the room, everyone was talking away and it is actually quite noisy for a Michelin starred restaurant.  I was here with a friend and not a date so it didn't really bothered me.\nThe service was beyond perfect and I give them full marks for it.  Very attentive waiters and waitresses and no mistake done.  We are not locals and we could see quite a few tables with foreigners here but everyone was treated with respect and with no attitude.  This is what makes a good restaurant.  \nThe wine list is extensive.  We asked the sommelier to recommend wines that go well with our courses and all of them were perfectly paired.  If you want to pair it with your 7 courses, it is usually about \u00a3100 per person but you may have less and pay less so it really is up to you. \nI am not going to go into details on each of the dishes that I have tried.  I had the seasonal tasting menu and my friend had the prestige tasting menu.  The pictures that I have posted speaks for itself and what you will be expecting from the dishes.  We also tried a bit of each other's food so that we know how the food was compared to other Michelin star restaurants.  \nUnfortunately for us, the food I have to say is not up to a 3 Michelin star quality.  Maybe we went in expecting too much from this restaurant but I have been to some 1 & 2 starred restaurants and the flavour and taste of their food did surpass Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.  I believe that the quality and taste of the food is more geared towards a 1 star quality especially for the price that I am paying.  The Prestige menu was priced at \u00a3145 and the Seasonal menu was priced at \u00a3175.  Of course, the Seasonal menu tasted better than the Prestige menu since it is more expensive.  \nI think this is a one in a lifetime experience which I agree as it is after all a 3 Michelin star restaurant from Gordon Ramsay.  However, I don't think I will come back as we came here to give a 3 star a try.  Just not value for money and definitely not a 3 Michelin star I was expecting food wise.

My cousin and I each had the menu prestige, and made slightly different choices to try to cover as much variety as possible.

It was perfectly folded and completely packed full of seafood. \nTo keep it short, every dish was cooked exactly as described to perfection. The dishes are influenced by local flavors (you'll see it in the herbs, especially) so it is a good way to become intimate with that cuisine. \nThe decor could have used a little help. The wood paneling on the walls makes me think they're getting ready to pack up and close shop.

We accomplished this, except Restaurant Gordon Ramsay wasn't open when we arrived, so we found ourselves at Maize Grill also owned by Gordon Ramsay.  That was a great experience too, but back to this review.  \nEverything at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is very precise. Every member of staff gives you a great deal of attention. The dining room itself is fairly small, it can't be easy to maneuver around room without running into each other, but they do a flawless job.  They don't quite stand by your table, but they politely guide you through the experience.  There were two sommeliers to make recommendations as well as to serve and explain the wine with each course.  \nEven as efficient as the staff is our meal lasted three hours (and I was trying to go slowly!)

Since we are all from America and only staying in Europe for short time, we figured we might as well treat ourselves to a extremely special dinner. \nThe service was wonderful. The sommelier, instinctively telling that we were college students, gave my friends (I don't drink) a cheap but wonderful wine recommendation, which they eagerly accepted. The matire'd, apparently renowned in London for his welcoming nature, greeted us, asked where we were from, and genuinely seemed interested in a trio of kids that didn't seem to belong. \nAll three of us got the tasting menu, The food was stunning. Everything was prepared incredibly carefully, and the presentation was a visual masterpiece. We couldn't help but to take pictures of the food, which I feared would make us stand out in a room of the mature and sophisticated. \nIt started with a small collection of starters that included scotch eggs. Next camethe pressed Foie Gras, which had a smooth texture and sweet tartness to it due to the green apples.Then we moved onto the Isle of Gigha Halibut, which was presented with this ras el hanout infused broth. The flowers that laid atop the delicate fish were a delightful surprise, both visually and in flavor.\nThe Ravioli of lobster, langoustine, and salmon is undeniably the star of the show, being one of the signature dishes. Easily the best ravioli I've ever had in my life, I was saddened when it so quickly disappeared off my plate. I eased the pain away by licking the delicious bisque that accompanied it.\nNext were the Cotswold lamb, Mango Jasmine and passion fruit soup, Cucumber sorbet (which was used as a palate cleanser), and finally dessert with Lemonade parfait. The Lemonade parfait was truly an incredible way to finish off the meal. It was possibly the most beautifully extravagant concept for a dessert I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The transparent sauce that aligned the plate was especially delicious. \nAfter our meal, the matire'd actually invited us into the kitchen. We were eager to see Claire and thank her for the meal, but unfortunately she had left by the time we finished. The kitchen trip was a unique experience in its own right, as I have never seen the kitchen of a restaurant before, much less that of a 3-star Michelin one!\nAfterwards, our maitre'd bid us farewell, wishing us a good night and safe travels back to our respective homes in the states. I was astonished he actually remembered all of our cities, but in retrospect, I shouldn't have been surprised such an impressive man would be in charge of such an incredible restaurant.\nIt's been a few months since that night, but I still look back upon it with fondness.

The key points about my experience:\n1.  The food was phenomenal\n2. We were treated a little weirdly at times\nHere's some detail on point 2: We are American, we are well versed in fine dining.  Does anyone come here who isn't?  You can't exactly walk in off the street or stumble into a reservation...  Anyway, the first weird thing was that we requested the wine pairings.  The pairing isn't like a typical tasting menu where there is a published price, they give you a range because they claim to select wines on a case by case basis after discussing likes and dislikes with you.  That's fine.  The weird thing was that when my husband told a server that we were interested in pairings, she asked us who was hosting the dinner.  We were perplexed, never having been asked that question before, there were only two of us (married couple).  After a painful few moments we discerned that she was asking who would be paying for dinner and then verified that we were okay with the range of prices that had been printed on the menu that we had *just* been perusing.  Yes, we ordered the pairings, we are prepared to pay within the listed price range.  The second weird thing was when we selected our chosen main course.  I ordered the pigeon (or squab as we yanks call it) and the server (I think the GM?) asked if I was fine with it being cooked med. rare.  I said yes, that is fine with me, that is how I prefer it.  It seemed as if he didn't quite believe me and then basically proceeded to try to talk me out of going with the chef's recommendation.  He said \"I don't know, are you sure?  It is served *quite pink*, we can cook it more for you if you prefer...\"  I'm not sure what this was about, perhaps they've been burned by too many stupid Americans sending back a beautifully cooked dish to be cooked more?  Or I was just being profiled as a dumb woman who doesn't know anything?  I can't be sure.  Regardless, the squab was perfection and I ate every bite.  Perhaps this gentleman recognized that he'd misjudged us, he gave us a tour of the kitchen at the end of our meal, presumably to compensate for his somewhat poor behavior earlier in the meal.\nUltimately, the meal was fantastic, the food was fabulous and the weirdness didn't ruin it, but I thought it was notable, I've never been treated this way in such a highly regarded restaurant before.\nHopefully someone from the restaurant reads this so that they can take the feedback, but I have a feeling that management at establishments such as R GR don't give a hoot about yelp reviews..."}, "1807": {"rating": 5, "review": "So we made reservations for two people six months ahead of time as that was how far out they were booked \nI had the Menu Prestige (\u00a3145) and my date had the Season Inspiration Menu (\u00a3195)- both choices were terrific in their own right.

Not only were our desserts delicious, we got extra desserts as well! The white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls were served in a tin with dry ice so that was a fun effect!

It is by far one of the best restaurants in the world. Things to take note of is that this restaurant and it's staff/chefs are extremely well trained. The design of the restaurant is simple and elegant, allowing for the service and food to shine.\n- The service staff is phenomenal. They are attentive, courteous, and very knowledgeable. They seem to make it a priority to anticipate your needs. It is almost as if they can read your mind. Their timing and delivery of service is impeccable.\n- The cooks/chefs have food put together and delivered in appropriate time. Every dish was always spot-on, well plated, eye catching, and of course delicious beyond words. Every item we received from the menu had obviously been very well thought out. Flavors worked/melded in a way that accented the ingredients used to develop a symphony of deliciousness. Though I enjoyed every dish, the one item that would consistently bring me back to the UK and this restaurant would definitely be their ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon in a light bisque with lemongrass and chervil velout\u00e9. That is bar none, one of the most wonderful things I have ever had. I was literally licking that plate clean. \nIn my experience with all the restaurants that I have visited in the world, this is by far one of the front runners and very deserving of it's Michelin stars.

In fact, my favorite part of the meal was the dessert, a grapefruit custard with mascarpone sorbet. The main, roast venison, was quite well-prepared but nothing to write home about. It was not impressive. The service, too, was quite rude. My group of 6 was not treated the same as the other clients, as we were obviously half the age as everyone and were from America. We were not seated immediately because our last party member was not there yet, but another group after us was seated immediately even though they said they were waiting for someone as well. What's more, our friend was made to change into leggings from her jeans, which is totally acceptable given their dress code, but then we saw another woman with shorts on who had not been made to change. Additionally, the host kept on asking us if we knew what tartare and venison were and asked us to tell him what it was just to make sure we knew... if we didn't know, would we be there ordering it?

We came during lunch time (they open their reservation MONTHS in advance, and at 4 months before, I was only able to grab lunch spots). Their menu availability is the same for lunch and dinner, in addition to a lunch special menu that they only offer during lunch time. My boyfriend and I went a la carte during our meal. As always, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, and I decided to go with the option that lets you try every dessert they have. I didn't realized how big their portion sizes are, so by the time dessert came, I was already way too full. I got the foie gras for appetizer and fish for entree. They're definitely more of a \"traditional\" fine cuisine place. So if you're into traditional French cuisine such as The French Laundry, this is your place.

Others imagine the cabbies, fashion, and pub scene. \nBut hardly anyone can attest that London is known for delicious food. The statement itself is an oxymoron.\nUntil you try Gordon Ramsay's in Chelsea.\nI have been a huge GR fan since the first season of Hell's Kitchen. Attending a live dinner service is on my bucket list just to try a dollop of his award-winning sauces. And even though Gordon may have his anger management issues on the show, the man can cook. Then I realized, what am I waiting for?? I should just come to him! So I did...\nBut don't take my word for it. Ask Michelin. Gordon Ramsay is a recipient of three prestigious Michelin Stars, the highest accolade one can receive by the Michelin brothers. \nThe Michelin guide began in 1900 as a handy-dandy manual for those traveling within Europe for reliable gas stations, eateries, and service tips. In 1933, it launched its Red Guide that inspected restaurants all around Europe under the highest caliber of secrecy and standards. The inspectors to this day are anonymous (even the parents don't know their line of work), and the secret diners are funded by the Michelin company, not the restaurant. \nThe grading scale is 1 to 3 stars: One being good in its category, two being excellent and worth a detour, and three being exceptional and worth a journey in itself. The Michelin grading system has received worldwide respect and to date, less than 100 restaurants around the globe have been bequeathed with the 3-star honor.\nWith that said, I was beyond excited to try this place. I had booked my reservation at least four months before I set foot in London. Service was spot-on with our waiter epitomizing the perfect blend of cordialness and humor. He grew up in Dijon (France) and was extremely passionate about the menu. My bf and I ordered the Prestige Menu and the Seasonal Inspirations Course. \nEach seven-course dish was impeccably crafted and presented. The poached lobster, langoustine and salmon ravioli held remarkable flavor. My foie gras was embedded with the sweet juice of duck confit and pickled pears. The next protein courses were the halibut and suckling pig with crispy skin that I could have nibbled on the entire evening. After the soup, cheese and fruit course, we were pretty stuffed. But lo and behold, the desserts shined brightest for us. \nOne was a Milk Chocolate Truffle Tree. This literally was a silver tree stand with truffle-infused chocolates awaiting our degustation delights. Like Ancient Romans plucking grapes off one-by-one, we fed each other these signatures confections with smiles and laughs. The second dessert was a White Chocolate and Strawberry Ice Cream platter on dry ice. As if that wasn't enough, the best was yet to come.\nThe most memorable part of this experience was being secretly escorted \"behind the scenes\" to the kitchen where all the magic happens. When the manager found out that we had visited all the way from Hawaii, they asked if we'd like to see the chefs at work. Unfortunately, Chef Gordon himself was in New York but Chef Patron Clare Smyth (Chef of the Year winner by UK Food Guide and the only female UK Chef to win 3 Michelin Stars) was leading the team, mastering the finishing touches on every dish sent out. Their kitchen was absolutely spotless, and every member of the kitchen was working harmoniously like instruments perfecting the tunes before it hit the audience's ears.\nI still remember the tray of mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup about to be served to the dining room, poised in a champagne flute and glass straw. Chef Clare stopped the waiter and placed a drop of sugar water on the end of each straw to ensure it was perfectly presented in taste and vision. \nThis experience took my breath away and we talk about it every so often when we relive our European getaways. I look forward to meeting Chef Gordon in person one day to express my gratitude to him and his staff for a lifetime of delicious memories."}, "1822": {"rating": 5, "review": "The easiest five-star given.\nThe service was impeccable (be forewarned, lots of superlative adjective will be thrown out in this review).

All were professional and friendly, definitely the true definition of dining service. \nThe food was too perfect, every single bite was memorable and if only I could keep the sensation in a jar and savor the moment again and again. We ordered the 3 course dinner menu, and let me tell you outright, the amuse bouche were as good, and some were even better than the 3 course menu.

Made the same mistake of booking 9:30 PM reservations at three other NYC 3 Michelin Star restaurants (Le Bernadin, Jean Georges and Daniel before it lost a star) and all of them were just OK to me - nothing special whatsoever. You would think that a restaurant is responsible for quality no matter what the time but I'm finding that this just isn't the case consistently. \nWhen it comes to high end \"French\" restaurants, you hold a very high standard to how every dish is prepared and that the flavors of the courses are that which you only find at that restaurant in the entire world. Other Yelpers had a great experience but again, I'm assuming that the late reservation impacted our total experience completely. \nMy girlfriend and I entered and were walked to our table in the very minimalistic yet cozy dining room. Most of the tables were filled but I can presume that since it was already 9:30 PM, some diners already finished their dinner.\nYou have the option of an a la carte, a traditional Prestige menu or a \"Seasonal Inspiration\" menu.

The food and experience were just not my taste compared to every other 3 Star around the world - the fish were fishy tasting and the meats were gamey and difficult to cut and eat (not cooked all that well).\nAlso not a fan that they didn't leave us with any takeaway, not even a takeaway menu of the experience. :( \nDO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BOOKING LATE NIGHT RESERVATIONS!!"}, "1825": {"rating": 5, "review": "Easily the best restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. \nThe whole experience is exactly what you'd expect from a three Michelin star establishment.\nThe setting is beautiful and with only only 12 or so tables very exclusive so book well ahead.

Purely elegant, service was excellent, I would like to dine here again in the future."}, "1832": {"rating": 4, "review": "Everybody knows it, lovers and haters. In two words, Gordon Ramsay. And this is his flagship restaurant. Here you do not dine out, this is a food experience, this is a culinary trip. You don't get here by chance, and every single dish, every single instant will be stuck in your mind for a long time. But yet, small imperfections caused the lack of the \"top quality seal\" approval (yes we have a seal!) from me and my lovely lady.\nAs soon as we entered here we got the feeling this was a place like no others. The cure for details is maniacal, from the door to the tables. But here we also started to notice the first issues: the place is quite small, as it should be, but it's rather busy: we were lucky in receiving a table on the wall, but a couple in front of us (really, at less than 1 m with the corridor for waiters in between) was right in the middle of the hall, something completely uncomfortable giving the amount of tables on the wall. It seemed to me they really pushed their capacity over the limit, and that's a serious error.\nBut as we said, the decor both of the place and on the wall is incredibly refined and classy. Quite minimalistic in the style, it has several little classy touches both me and my lady love. Incredible.\nThe waiters were nice and warming, very accommodating (even too much perhaps, given that we were on a romantic dinner) and they spoke to us in several languages. But from the other side, some of the waiters lacked in appearance, with a wrong make up messed-up hairs. Something you don't want to find in a three stars restaurant.\nBut then, let's speak about the main reason we get there, the food! First time we came here, we wanted to try all the classical dishes the restaurant is acclaimed for, so here we go with the tasting menu. We chose a half bottle in order to get something a little bit more special, and we received the service we expected considering the age and the caliber of the wine, candle, decanter and so on.\nAt first I prepared an awesome review with every single dish carefully described, but the maximum size of 5000 words on yelp is really too much for me. Hence, I just want to speak to you about two dishes, my personal favourite ones.\nThe first one is a dish I waited for years: \"Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon\". Wow. Already the name is something to blow up your mind, putting together the sweetness of the lobster, the delicacy of the langoustine and the heavy and powerful taste of salmon. And the result is so good it can't be described, you need to taste it. Served with a delicious bisque with sorrel giving that extra citric needle, it's just one of the best things I ever tasted in my life. A dish so delicious they should name a star with its name.\nThe second one is another famous masterpiece for Gordon Ramsay restaurant: Isle of Gigha halibut with Atlantic King crab, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth.\nNow, let's start from the beginning: presentation is ridiculously perfect: the dish comes with the halibut and the crab on top, and they proceed to serve the broth (at room temperature) all around the halibut (like they do with the bisque and the ravioli). The difference is that the broth is liquid, transparent and with flower petals and the composition of the dish rapidly becomes a painting. A wonderful painting, relaxing and intriguing. And the broth, oh my the broth. Incredible, powerful, with 4 thousands flavor all balanced between each other, it's like a Kandinsky frame on your mouth (yes keep going with art paragons!), you can always feel something different and something new, evolving and moving, but the big picture, the big screen is always appealing and entertaining. This dish alone deserves a dinner here. Full stop. If you don't like such a perfect combination of taste, smell, sight I don't even want to be a friend of yours on yelp. And I'm serious.\nIt's painful not to speak about every other dish, as every single plate on our table was a piece of art, even the ones we didn't like, but each one had a history and was perfectly concepted and realized. It's amazing.\nUnfortunately, as every adventure, we had to end our trip. We started good, we had some initial issues, we had some awesome surprise and we reached home safely. All in all it's a wonderful dining experience, but because of some strange errors I found it does not deserves the 5 stars.

The next surprise item was a bright green ricotta dish, beautifully plated with fresh vegetables (tangy and salty, every bite slightly different).\nThen the appetizers: I was a served a single giant lobster, langoustine and salmon ravioli, surrounded with a wood sorrel sauce (also bright green). It had a balanced, hearty seafood flavor, and the savory wood sorrel was oddly addictive. My dining partners both had the scallops--I'm not normally a fan, but these were probably the best I've tasted. They came with two sauces: a nice sweet apple-based one and another (even better) that was concentrated with walnut flavor.\nEntrees: My sister had the turbot with greens and an unidentified vegetable (sea beet?)--nicely seasoned and meaty, but not really a standout. My mom and I had pork five ways. The chou farci (stuffed cabbage) was my least favorite, salty but otherwise unexciting. (There was also a smidge of applesauce that I tried but mostly avoided.) The sausage was also slightly disappointing, but still well-spiced and quite decent. The loin was elevated by some slightly acidic potatoes and bite of thin, perfectly crisp bacon. The suckling pig was tender and flavorful, accented by sweet bit of pineapple...\n...And then there was pork belly. Oh, the pork belly. This razor-thin rectangle of salty, fatty goodness was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The brilliance of it was the contrast in textures: immaculately crispy on the top layer, melt-in-your-mouth tender on the bottom. It came with two preparations of apple--one baked, one fresh and thin-sliced. It was good with them, it was good without them. It was just good.\nAnother intermission: a sweet, brightly flavored mango-passion fruit beverage that was a lovely pre-dessert palate cleanser. We split our three desserts evenly between us. The peppermint souffle was immensely fluffy--so much so that it was essentially a minty egg foam. A bit strange, but better with the chocolate sorbet (which there should've been more of). The chocolate, praline mousse and granola dish was very nice, possibly the best of the three and a nice mix of sweet and pleasantly bitter. The lemonade parfait was easily the most interesting one, jam-packed with sweet and sour flavor. It came with a beautifully spun honey tuile ring, a creamy sheep's milk sorbet and a tangy bergamot gel.\nFinally, three more mini-surprises. The elderflower Turkish delight was an appropriately floral gelatin treat. The thin wafers of chocolate peanut brittle were nothing very unusual, but delicious with a balanced sweet-saltiness. The white-chocolate-dipped morsels of strawberry ice cream, immersed in dry ice fog for maximum effect, were a memorable end to a spectacular dinner.\nMy meal here was delicious and inventive, with several hits and only a couple of partial misses. I would love to make a return pilgrimage someday and try their even more elaborate \"prestige\" or \"seasonal inspiration\" menus.

I showed up and was charged 200 pounds directly to my lunch meal. I understand the importance of no-show fees, but here's what was wrong. \n- 2 people in our party of 4 couldn't come, and my friend had called a week in advance to change the party size (the restaurant requires 48 hrs advance notice)...only, the restaurant didn't actually change our party size. \n- The people who showed up (myself and a friend) were charged 100 pounds/person for the people who didn't show, even though I wasn't liable for the reservation. My friend who couldn't come had made the reservation, and the charge should've gone to the card on file for the reservation (her card).\n- Gordon Ramsay restaurant has conflicting \"no-show/cancellation\" policies on their OpenTable home page, their website, OpenTable confirmation email, and information relayed by the restaurant representative. Only the person making the reservation on OpenTable had access to the \"accurate\" policy -- which apparently is that the party size has to be successfully changed. Notifying the restaurant isn't enough.\n- Also note, the per person no-show fee is 100 pounds, but the lunch menu is only 65 pounds per person.\nDuring the actual dining experience, the manager stopped by all tables except ours, and I was told to contact the restaurant via email. \nIt then took 10+ emails for the manager to admit that Gordon Ramsay should've charged the card on file. Turns out, he didn't charge the card on file because the process is longer and more complicated (he has to go through an account executive at the main office). Regretfully, the manager didn't realize that as he cut some corners on the correct process and charged the fee directly to the meal of people who did show up, my dining experience was negatively affected. I still have yet to receive an apology for the miscommunication from Gordon Ramsay and the way in which the no-show fees were handled. \n  \nSo here is my sad, but quick tip to you: \n- If your complete party can't make it, order the lunch set menu for the \"invisible people\" in your party.

Razor thin slices of baby vegetables and roasted shallots dressed the foie gras with amazing grace.  This could be said of every single plate in this menu, which contains many of the restaurant's signature dishes.\nBut here comes my inner comment:  the food mostly looked  better than it actually tasted.  A small square of poached fish surrounded by delicate flower petals and broth was-- bleh.  A beautiful mousse of egg white, potato and toasted truffle served in an almost-whole egg shell was -- hard to swallow.  It's like deliciousness was sacrificed for artistic merit.

My father and stepmother treated me to a lunch I will remember for the rest of my life.\nThe petite dining room features a mere 14 tables, yet it packs enough charm and splendor to fill a big box store. Never attempt to eat here sans a reservation. Secure a spot at least one week in advance just to be safe. My sister, who lives in London, placed a call almost a month prior to our visit.\nGordon Ramsay's posh flagship on Royal Hospital Road employs enough wait staff to allow each member to serve a specific course. Another paramount consideration: This is not a fast-food, dash-in and dash-out establishment. A leisurely, glacial pace of food consumption is essential if you want to appreciate the myriad flavors married by Chef Patron Clare Smyth.\nWe ordered from the lunch menu and elected for the three-course option, which costs 55 pounds per head. As the five-star rating should indicate, not one pound of the exorbitant bill was wasted.\nThe extravagant cuisine adventure commenced with a complimentary consomme. The made-from-rich-flavored stock was drinkable, with baby radishes, heirloom tomatoes and chives delicately assembled in the center of the bowl. I did not leave a trace of this delightful opener on the plate.\nI opted to start with the roasted quail with soy honey, togorashi, pickled vegetables and herbs. The house-made soy sauce and dijon mustard rim delivered a perfect accompaniment for the two wing cuts of soft roasted bird. I cannot remember enjoying another quail dish more than this.\nNext, I selected the roasted rabbit loin with Bayonne ham, salted baked turnips, toasted hazelnuts and pickled mustard seed. The exquisite presentation of this and every other dish served at the restaurant merits museum enshrinement. The many components at work on the wide plate bonded beautifully. The mustard seed and savory sauce enhanced the wonders of each diminutive bite.\nThroughout the afternoon, one wait staff member offered three different breads paired with finely sculpted salted and unsalted butter towers. The onion bacon brioche ranked as my favorite.\nFor my last official course, dessert, I chose the chocolate bars with toasted milk mousse and tonka bean ice cream. As much as I love caramel popcorn, I would not have pictured it as a sinful ally in a gourmet dessert dish. Each bite of popcorn with a splash of the milk mousse was even better than the previous one. The caramel, dark and milk chocolate bars melted in my mouth. You can't buy candy this delectable at a convenience store.\nPatrons also receive a complimentary dessert tray with four ice cream balls served in a bowl of steaming dry ice plus two lemon Turkish delights and two chocolate ganache squares.\nThe championship clincher of this five-star experience: Waiters had eavesdropped on our table during an earlier birthday toast and brought me a sixth course, a miniature but wicked chocolate-hazelnut cake complete with a candle. That they nailed my favorite sweet combination, most often referred to as Nutella or Bacio, has to be the greatest instance of dumb luck ever. Wow!\nWait at least one minute after receiving each dish because servers tend to return in a few moments with extra goodies and garnishes for your selected item.\nThis extraordinary day also included the British Museum, the London Eye and Coldplay at the Royal Albert Hall.

Admittedly not the best way to showcase Chef Smyth's skills yet at the same time far more broad in scope than the shorter prix-fixe it was of several Ramsay signatures that my meal comprised and with courses such as the tender ravioli and delicate halibut every bit deserving of their legendary status served alongside Milliat nectars, a top tier bread program paired to Bordier, plus a cheese cart rich in selections from Antony not a single detail seemed overlooked.  Delving into a few modernist flairs as the meal transitioned to sweets it was only here that I diverged from the \"Prestige\" path and although commanding a \u00a320 premium the Assisette de l'Aubergine was every bit worth the price - a trio of the restaurant's daily desserts paired with an individual portion of the restaurant's signature tarte and capped by a full sized souffl\u00e9, itself bearing a \u00a320 tag if ordered a la carte.  Beleaguered by some due to its namesake's antics but every bit worth its celebrated status suffice it to say that whether Chef Ramsay himself has cooked on Hospital Road recently is irrelevant, the kitchen remains in good hands while the front of house flows with an effortless affability far too infrequently seen amongst Europe's mostly highly ranked."}, "1844": {"rating": 5, "review": "Absolutely astounding.\nMy wife and I visited this restaurant as our last stop on our 2 week vacation to London.\nAmazing service and amazing food.

The green apple and lime sorbet was a refreshing dish which came as just the right stage of the dinner: it really hit the spot.\nThe assiette of spring vegetables just seemed like a plate of nicely cooked vegetables to me, nothing too special about that one.  In the same way, the final course was simply strawberries with meringue.  With application, I'm sure we could find a nice punnet of strawberries ourselves to enjoy at home.\nThe service was slick and well-practised, however, I sometimes found myself thinking about when the next course was coming, which I hadn't experienced at other 3-star michelin star restaurants.\nOverall, an excellent evening, but the minor points noted above contributed to my 4-star rating."}, "1863": {"rating": 5, "review": "It's been several months since my meal at Gordon Ramsay, and while many of the  details of that night have escaped me, I'm as certain now as I was that day - this is one of the top restaurants I've experienced, and likely every will.\nEverything about GR was perfect, from start to finish.  The food (of course) was amazing.  But the service is what I'll remember, and is the standard that I'll hold any top restaurant to from this day on.

Something went very, very wrong on our visit that is obviously not the norm. But it was such a dramatic departure from every other Michelin *'d restaurant I've visited that I feel the need to share.  When we travel we choose the restaurants we visit very carefully and after our service fiasco at RGR I really wish we had chosen another place to complement the (exemplary!) Fat Duck on our London trip.  \nI also sent the below feedback directly to the restaurant and... received no follow-up.  Not a word.  So this is long, but hey! Now I've got a bone to pick. :)\nIn the restaurant's online follow-up survey, I chose \"fair\" to describe the service; a more accurate description would have been \"Flawless, followed suddenly by a flip to confusingly terrible.\"  After the listed courses on the menu were complete, we were offered coffee (which I accepted and my husband declined) and were told that \"chocolates\" would be forthcoming. The coffee arrived, I drank it, and time passed.  Other tables were continuing to be served.  Eventually my empty cup was taken away and I declined further coffee.  Perplexingly, my husband than received a clean plate in front of him (I did not).  We sat.  More time passed.  We started to think this was a bit awkward but continued to wait and enjoy each other's company.  \nEventually (after about half an hour from when coffee was served) we were offered to see the kitchen, which we accepted.  Upon our return from the kitchen, I saw my place also now also had one of the mysterious plates and we assumed the (alleged) chocolates would arrive shortly.  Adjacent diners finished their meals, left, and the tables had new people seated at them. After another 15 minutes of being ignored entirely by staff we decided it was getting ridiculous.  We actually had to flag down a server and ask what was going on. (!)  \nThe gentleman who I assume is the front of house came to our table and said that we hadn't pushed our plates away and therefore it was assumed we wanted more coffee?  Which was quite odd, given that we had both explicitly turned down more coffee, and in any case if the plates were coding this no one actually ever came by to offer it to us.  Not to mention the fact that my husband never actually HAD any coffee in the first place.  \nWe asked about the chocolates he had mentioned earlier, and he said, yes, the white chocolate course.  Pause.  We said we hadn't had it.  He said, \"Yes, with the liquid nitrogen?  The strawberries and white chocolate?\"  (As if we would have perhaps forgotten a course with a centerpiece of dry ice?)  We again said that we had not received this course and in fact had been ignored for the last 45 minutes.  He said he would get it and then about five minutes later it finally arrived.  Then we finished, paid, and exited, completely confused by what had just happened.  \nAt no point did any of the service staff acknowledge that it is completely weird and inappropriate for diners to be left on entirely their own for nearly an hour, without so much as a cursory check-in, certainly at a restaurant with such a reputation for exemplary service.  To be forgotten is one thing; to not have even the slightest acknowledgement of the inconvenience and confusion it created in our evening is quite another thing on top of that.    \nWe have had the pleasure of dining at many Michelin two- and three-star restaurants, and this was by far the most bizarre service experience we have ever had at an establishment of this calibre.  Unfortunately the experience at the end of our meal soured what would otherwise have been almost a literally perfect evening out.   (On the other hand, it has given us a hilarious story to share with our friends, which we certainly have been.)\n \nAll in all it was a lovely evening that ended up in bizarro-land, followed by what appeared to be a completely oblivious unawareness from staff that anything was even wrong.

The only possible negative I can think of  is the price, but it was worth every penny for a special occasion and I'd feel lucky to have the opportunity to experience it again!\nMy boyfriend and I went for our anniversary and it couldn't have been better. I have been to a number of 3 michellin star restaurants but this was aboslutely THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE of my life, not only because of the food but because of the service. I often feel uncomfortable with the level of service that goes along with these types of restaurants but they did an excellent job of making our 25-year-old selves feel at home. From the moment you enter, they find out what brings you there and a bit about you. For the rest of the night, every person who served us knew we were from NYC and that it was our anniversary. They had the level of great service without the things that I find to personally be over the top or uncomfortable, e.g. they don't have a person working in the bathroom but they still escorted me to it and opened the door for me when I went. \nThe food: UNREAL. We did 3 courses from the a la carte menu with unbelievable wine pairings. I rarely like wine pairings because I'd rather choose wines that I prefer but the wines that the excellent sommelier recommended not only transformed our meals but we also left with a new favorite dessert wine. \nOur menu:\nBoyfriend's starter: Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with a lemongrass and chervil velout\u00e9 \nMy starter (the BEST foie gras of my life...and I try foie gras pretty much every time its offered): Pressed foie gras with peppered Madeira jelly, smoked duck, new season rhubarb and blood orange\nBoyfriend's entree: Suckling pig, crispy belly, roasted loin, homemade sausage, chou farci and braised leg with crushed potatoes and spring onions\nMy entree: Fillet of line caught sea basswith cucumber, rock samphire, oyster and caviar sauce\nBoyfriend's dessert: Smoked chocolate cigar with blood orange and cardamom ice cream\nMy dessert: Lemonade parfait with honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt sorbet\nWe LOVED everything. They were also incredible about my food allergies. They made dairy substitutes where necessary without compromising the integrity of the dish and where they didn't think they could make substitutes (like the oyster & caviar sauce on my fish) they discussed it with me. In the case of the sauce, we decided together to put the sauce on the side so I could put the amount that I thought was good for me. I wasn't planning on not having dairy on a night like this but it definitely improved my experience to have them working out for me. \nSo... definitely go!

Scallops were perfectly cooked and the autumney sauce was not over powering at all but very flavorful. \nAll of their main dishes sounded so good, I had a hard time deciding what to get. Our server told me his favorite was the lamb dish, so I went for it. This is how they describe it on the menu, 'Best end of Cotswold lamb with confit breast and braised shank, navarin of autumn vegetables and vitelotte potatoes.' So, it's like a tasting menu of 'best of lambs'! Meat was so tender and it was one of the most beautifully plated dishes I've ever had. \nFor dessert, we got the chocolate cylinder and apple tart but they also gave us complimentary white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls, dark chocolate truffles, and rose Turkish delights!

Two months and various confirmation e-mails and phone calls later, we arrived at this lovely little restaurant on Royal Hospital Road, ready for a treat.\nWe were the first to arrive and were promptly seated at a little table set in crisp white with a centerpiece of white roses in a silver vase.  The space is small and charming, with good light and an aura that evokes mellow wine in gently clinked glasses.\nThe service throughout the meal was phenomenal.  The staff:patron ratio was around 1:1, and various polite and friendly gentlemen attended to our table to welcome us, check on us, clear our crumbs, perfume our feet...okay, that last bit didn't happen, but maybe only because we went with the cheapest menu option?  Our primary waiter was wonderful, charismatic and helpful.  He deserved a blue ribbon for unobtrusive small talk.\nThere were at least five bread options, and we sampled the olive, the baked potato honey, and the rosemary potato.  The best was the rosemary potato, but they were all fresh and yummy with knived dabs from the swirly beehive of yellow butter.  Incidentally, you get a choice of salted and unsalted butter, which I was surprised to note as unusual.\nThe amuse bouche was a tomato consomme with a cute baby-shrimp-sized curl of langoustine accompanied by peas, fava beans, olive oil, and a teeny black cluster of osetra caviar.  It was mild and refreshing.\nWe went with the daily lunch menu priced at \u00a345 a head, with three options for appetizers and entrees, and four for dessert including the cheese plate (with a \u00a33 supplement).  Our waiter indicated that should either of us have any dietary restrictions, the kitchen would be more than happy to accommodate us.\nI started with the salt cod brandade with Noir de Bigorre ham, poached quail eggs, chargrilled red pepper, olives, and rocket salad.  My mom got the saffron risotto with clams, mussels, langoustines, and tomato, \"paella\" style.  (It was meant to come with chorizo as well, but my mother doesn't eat pork - I know, crazy.)  The brandade was a pleasant blend of pureed cod and potato with a smooth texture enhanced by the meatiness of the fish, great for spreading on the accompanying toasted rosemary crostinis.  The brandade was wrapped in a strip of ham and topped with the quail egg with the veggies and olives nestled on the side.  The olives were excellent on their own and as an accompaniment.  The risotto was beautifully cooked and pretty flavorful, and I imagine it would've been better with chorizo.\nFor our mains, I opted for the roasted saddle of rabbit with sage, Bayonne ham, trompette de la mort, and stuffed Provencal vegetables, and my mom got the fillet of daurade royale with navet, carrot, radish, baby gem lettuce, and artichokes baurigole.  The rabbit was nice, herb-stuffed and wrapped like my starter in yummy fatty pig.  It came with teeny little rabbit kidneys looking all cute and un-organ-like on the side, along with a wonderful stuffed shallot and a wonderful stuffed cherry tomato.  The sublimely juicy vegetables were the elevating component on this plate.  The daurade royale, a simply cooked sea bream in a light creamy sauce, was elegant if unexciting.\nFor dessert we went halfsies on the banana parfait with passion fruit and salted caramel ice cream and the lemon meringue and almond tart with fromage frais sorbet.  The parfait was a block of dry icy reconstituted banana coated with dark chocolate, topped with unmemorable ice cream and sitting atop a meager drizzle of passion fruit.  On the whole, it wasn't awful, but I would've preferred a good commercial dessert.  In fact, the texture wasn't too far off from a very frozen Klondike bar.  The tart was much better, a thing of beauty - circular crust topped with gorgeous layers of lemon curd and nestlike meringue stuck with almond slivers, with narrow strands of caramel sauce leading out from the tart base to a perfect ball of sorbet - and quite delicious to boot, a perfect blend of sweet and sour.\nAfter dessert came two splendid extras.  First was a silver tree of spherical silver chocolate truffles.  They were fun to pick off and eat.  The meal ended with strawberry ice cream balls coated with white chocolate, served in a pot smoking with liquid ice.  The ice cream itself was pretty mediocre, but the presentation was so delightful I didn't really care.\nOverall, I was happy with my experience at Gordon Ramsay, though I wasn't quite wowed.  Other than the banana parfait, everything was great, but nothing was mind-blowing.  Since the place does have the three stars I suppose I was expecting more, but I can't say I didn't enjoy myself.

If you're not a celebrity, you have to watch your calendar and be flexible with when you'd like to go. You can only book 2 months (or 3, I forget) in advance, and it's so popular that almost all the bookings for that future date go from the moment their phone line opens at 9am.

I don't remember now what each course was, but they were all tastes of such expert combination and expression that you groaned a bit with each bite. As with this type of food, portions aren't huge, but there were a few rounds of amouse-bouches (and amusing they were, especially the bacon-and-eggs one) between courses that actually made us full at the end.\nWhile very classy, the serving staff didn't make you feel stupid if you weren't an expert at which utensil to use next. The sommelier was a great help at selecting from the 36-page (!) wine list. Some special, recently-obtained truffles were wafted past us in a wooden box, but we declined.

After arriving at 11am and spending the rest of the day seeing the sites London has to offer, our dinner reservations were at 930pm.  Having found a Tube station somewhat nearby (according to the maps), we were on our way.  I must have miscalculated the distance, because the journey from the Tube to the restaurant is no joke (at least 20 minutes), however it might have been exaggerated due to being unfamiliar to the surroundings.  \nAfter a nice stroll through Chelsea, we were warmly welcomed into the small restaurant.  There are only 14 tables, so it's small.  The decor I would label as Earth-toned on white with a contemporary flair.  Customarily there were a couple Amuse Bouche compliments of the chef which were fantastic.  Instantly I was transferred back into my seat at Per Se when I felt like a new born baby whom had just tasted his first morsel of food.  We went for the tastes of the season 7 course menu.  Everything was prepared nicely, with the flavors exploding onto your palate.  Clare Smyth is a marvel hands down.  Our Maitre d' Jean-Claude Breton's charm rivaled only my own.  Of course he noticed my bow tie and his attention to detail was superb.  \nThe meal is concluded with a plethora of sweets, desserts, and nitrogen concoctions unique to the styling Gordon Ramsay.  You are invited to stay as long as socially permitted at the end of the night, and of course a cab is waiting for you outside.\nFrom the moment you enter to the second you are let off the cab, you are treated with majestic manners fit for a royal for a royal price.

My girlfriend and I were the first ones in on a Monday night, so it was a bit quiet - but the restaurant (all of the 15 tables or so there) filled up pretty quickly. The service is much better than most of the upscale restaurants in NY - you get attention from virtually every waiter, and they all are quite knowledgeable about the items on the menu. A note - I am not sure what goes for 'dressy' in the UK, but the website (at least when I visited it), strongly implied that a jacket was a good choice for men to wear. And every other guy there was wearing one when we went...so better to be overdressed than underdressed, right?\nWe both got the 7-course tasting menu (unless you feel strongly about ordering your own dishes or don't want to shell , do this), which was absolutely delicious. First was a roll with lobster, langoustine, and avocado - absolutely a perfect match of a slightly heavier veggie with small, fresh pieces of tender seafood. Also served on the house were soft-boiled quail eggs that were lightly fried on the outside (they have a richer flavor than the regular eggs from the grocery store) and a cracker with salami inside (tasty!). The amuse bouche was langoustine in a tomato consumme, which was probably one of the more unremarkable dishes of the night (but was still very delicious).\nThe main course - fantastic. You get started off with pressed foie gras topped with jelly. I've had foie gras pate before that I was not a fan of, but this was out of this world. The combination with the peach had all the flavors working amazingly together...wow. Second course was seafood ravioli (lobster and langoustine). As with all of the dishes, they aren't large, but you savor each bite, and this tasted great, particularly with the sauce that was added by the waiters (note: the waiters added some kind of sauce, for both food presentation and taste, for almost every dish). The turbot, a fish I don't think I've had before (at least by this name) was delicious - a meatier fish that had 'chicken juice' poured on top that really accentuated the texture of the plate. My only mistake of the meal was ordering the pigeon (hopefully not the ones frequenting the city streets) instead of the lamb, which my girlfriend got. The pigeon was good - very smoky flavor - but the meat was a bit tougher than I would have liked. The lamb was outstanding from the bites I had, and I would recommend it if you're going to do the menu. The cheese selection (I don't know much about cheese, so I let the waiter pick a selection of 5) was delicious but a bit big if you're parsimonious on the cracker-to-cheese ratio: the waiters came around and asked me a few times if i was done. The creme brulee (my girlfriend's selection) was very light, but the highlight is the shot of apple juice (or smoothie, perhaps more appropriately) that adds a blast of fruitiness to the dessert. The mango/passion fruit with whip cream is a nice refresher, but is a little small to warrant being an entire course. The last dessert was delicious, but since I was too far in food heaven by this point, I forget right off what it was (aside from having delicious fruit sorbet in it).\nSince it was my girlfriend's birthday, we also got 3 more desserts - a box with pieces of pure chocolate ganache (so rich and so freakin' good...blows away the chocolate shops that sell individual pieces), pieces of Turkish Delight (the weakest link of the extra desserts, but still very good), and pieces of strawberry ice cream covered with frozen chocolate (like a bite-sized ice cream bar, except way better) that was frozen with dry ice...freakin' awesome.\nThis put a hurtin' on the wallet (the US conversion came out to $500), but you have to have a food experience like this at least once in your life.

Food was amazing though we thought the quality had been better in other 3 michelin restaurants though those had been dinners and tasting menus. The four stars: we thought the ambience was a tad of a disappointment, i.e we had expected some more privacy and exclusivity than being in a dining hall which was a little awkward when food takes time to prepare and you are trying to focus on having a good conversation with your date.

I'll admit it, his celebrity fame brought my attention to the restaurant but let's be honest... that's how most of us found out about this guy.\nI booked what I thought was plenty ahead of time, but realized there were very few choices left.  It seems to me that they only book one per table a night, but you get to choose the time.  My friend and I were in the first time slot at 6:30, but many guests were already seated when we arrived.  The entire experience takes a good 2+ hours so plan for that.  There are about ten or twelve tables in a room that was much smaller than I thought.  The decor is really nice.  Not overwhelming and inviting.\nThe staff is pretty ridiculous.  I think we sifted through at LEAST 12 different people while we were there.  Not a single dedicated waiter, and everyone took turns refilling water.  (you will be lucky if you get past a couple centimeters without a refill.  But the staff is incredibly friendly and not annoying at all.  They do leave you alone during your meal but are very attentive and can smell the slightest bit of concern and are willing to fulfill your needs.  Only one of the staff members bothered me.  He seemed like a French pretentious high class hipster or something, but in a funny way.  Another staff member looked like the muscle straight out of Russia in case anything went awry, he was cool.  Overall, very friendly and courteous staff.\nThe food... without a doubt the best I've ever had.  Three stars isn't kidding around.  I had a three course meal.  Scallops, lamb, and souffle.  We were given two separate starters, some sort of hors d'oeuvre finger foods that were amazing, followed by some sort of tomato based soup, but not like you think.  The broth was clear and served with some baby vegetables and prawns I believe.  Very small, just a taste.  The scallops were so good, I could eat that as my meal.  Best I've ever had.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing.  I had a bite of my friend's beef, and I thought it was better than the lamb, but now I'm being picky.  Both were delicious.  Before dessert we were given these mango coolies of some kind with glass straws.  Very refreshing.  The souffle I had, the only one I ever had, was of the banana variety and INCREDIBLE.  I'm not a dessert man at all, but it was freaking GOOD!  Then some finger sweets like Turkish delights and chocolates at the end.  So if I'm not forgetting anything, it's basically seven \"courses\" ... the portions may seem small upon appearance, but when you are finished with everything you leave perfectly satisfied.\nI'd recommend this to everyone, but the price tag is no joke.  90 quid each for the a la carte.

Everyone serves everyone. They not only serve, they chat. They constantly circle the room. It's almost dizzying if it weren't so phenomenal and well orchestrated and personal.\nThe first thing, a man walked up with what looked like a lidded cigar box. It had a couple of truffles in it, and he showed it to us and let us smell them. This was their \"feature\" item of the night. Then another man came and chatted with us. He asked what made us choose to visit and I said it was the highlight of my trip; and that I booked it because I watch all the Ramsay shows and this was to treat myself. \nI got the 7-course tasting menu. There were more than 7 courses though because they served up all sorts of extra surprises. My daughter decided to have the 3-course menu, which meant she got full-sized servings, but also many of my surprises. Hers actually cost more than mine because she got the pasta special with shaved truffle on top and I misunderstood: It wasn't 40 pounds for the entr\u00e9e...it was 40 pounds extra just for the truffle shavings on top of the pasta entr\u00e9e! Oh my! Good news is that she loved it. Bad news is, the whole dinner cost ~$500 US dollars. Still, it exceeded my expectations.\nOne woman came back throughout the evening with a tray of fresh bread slices of about 5 varieties: Wheat, white, olive, rosemary, etc. They asked if you wanted salted or unsalted butter and then proceeded to put a super soft, perfectly round ball of said butter on a slate slab on our table.\nI am not remembering it all, but I wrote down what I could remember as soon as we got back to our hotel. It was something like this:\n1. Surprise x3 for both of us: A plate with 3 mini appetizers on it. \n     a. Crab and avocado filling in a mini cone\n     b. Mini quail Scottish egg\n     c. Cracker with prosciutto or some sort of nice salami in it\n2. Amouse bouche (spelling catastrophe): Duck and parmesan fried ball in chestnut soup.\n3. Veal sweetbreads and sauteed foie grois (to die for!)\n4. Some white bean and Scottish mini mushrooms with Cornish turbot (white fish)\n5. Lobster, salmon and langoustine ravioli (this was my daughter's appetizer, so she got an extra large version and it was one of my 7 courses, so I got a slightly smaller version)\n6. My main dish: Cotswold lamb and veggies (I forget the details). My daughter's main dish: Pasta with truffle!\n7. My dessert: Some special Agen prune cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with Granny Smith apple juice. Yummy! My daughter got an assortment of ice creams and sorbet. They came as small scoops on top of a brick of ice. It was impressive but the photo does it no justice.\n8. Extra: We both then got mango smoothies as palette cleansers\n9. Surprise for both of us:\n     a. Strawberry ice cream bon bons with white chocolate coating on dry ice\n     b. Chocolate truffle bites\n     c. Lavender gelatin squares (this was the only thing that wasn't too tasty)\nSo when all that was said and done, one of the waiters came over and asked me if I'd like to see the kitchen since they had filmed back there before and he thought I might enjoy seeing the inner workings of their kitchen! Totally cool. So he escorted me and my daughter back to the kitchen where we met the executive chefs and they showed us all the stations and explained how they operated. It was spectacular.

The maitre-d' took very good care of us. We were offered champagne, which we astutely declined, since it would have cost \u00a312 a glass. My friend got the only menu with prices in, so we quickly skimmed to the back where the \u00a345 lunch menu was. I chose the three Rs: Risotto, Rabbit and Rum-Baba. I selected an English white wine at \u00a328 a bottle, but was told it was unavailable. That suited me, since there was a cheaper wine we had been too snobby to select, so we had that instead (\u00a322 a bottle.) This was cheaper than ordering by the glass and compares favourably to pub prices. The wine was stored in a chilled bucket and was absolutely delicious. Difficult to see how a more expensive wine could have tasted better. \nAn amuse bouche started, a little rosemary oil soup thing which we had to eat with little teaspoons, which annoyed me, so I didn't finish, which actually produced a comment from the m-d.\nThe risotto was perfect. No other word for it. Every little bit of seafood was cooked exactly right. It made us sorry to finish it. The rabbit was perfect as well, absolutely delicious. Rabbit pancakes were the first meal I ever ate in France, at Madame's in Le Touquet (5 course meals every night, real hot chocolate every morning) back in 1987, so it seemed appropriate. (Just realised the old girl is probably dead now.) I made my friends jealous with the rum baba, which was big and light with a huge dish of cream and a jug of pure rum. I was told I could ask for more rum (!) \nBecause I had told the maitre-d' my friend had been to other Gordon Ramsays in Tokyo and New York (perfectly true, he likes spending his money) we were invited to have a look round the kitchens! Where we met the woman of his dreams, Clare Smyth, and had our photo taken with her. After that, while waiting for our coffees in the little front area, we were given chocolate truffles and ice cream balls wrapped in white chocolate. Lovely. The coffees were perfect.

There are pieces of fish, some sort of grain, a sweet corn mousse, and \"micro asparagus\" (not sure what they were but that's what we called it!).  You want to make sure that corn mousse gets distributed around the plate, because it is awesome!

One of the best western twist salmon tataki I ever had. The deep fried Nasu (eggplant) salad with sesame miso dressing and bonito flakes, really surprised me, the texture was firm, I couldn't feel any oil at all, the touch of the spring onion, miso and katsobushi gave it the perfect combination for a nice umami, it melted in my mouth.

The Scallops from the robata served with a wasabi and shiso cream and the tenderstem broccoli with ginger and moromi miso were delicious too.\nRegarding the sushi, I must say the sashimi moriawase was one of the best ever in a long time, they offer different sizes depending on amount of persons, you will always have a selection of sashimi chosen by the chef, usually sake and toro are fixed included, there were hotate (scallops), lobster sashimi with different dressings (depends on season) this time was Mandarin Koshu, salmon tatar, hamachi, sea bream and ama ebi with imperial osietra caviar, all of it with nama wasabi, the fish was unquestionably of the highest grade and well execute, more than oishii. Unfortunately the maki selection was not at the same level, the ingredients and fusion were more than ok, but the quality of the rice was not the proper one, was too dry, however the temperature and the flavor was very good, my favorite was the wagyu tempura maki, quite impressive and nice move.   \n  \nAt least but not less important we enjoyed the tai no miso-yaki which is a fantastic sea bream fillet with miso and red pickled onion The fish was cooked perfectly, falling off with ease and silky soft inside, the taste of the miso was amazing, this dish impressed me a lot, it was a clear example that sometimes less is more.\nIf you were waiting for the sweet part, let me tell you that the dessert platter was 100 times Sugoi!!!!! I do not know how to start, lets see.... It was a simply beautiful plate with assorted of exotic fruits with some real good ice creams, a lovely soft and warm dark chocolate brownie with a surprise viscous green tea pudding fondant inside, had a peanut, vanilla and chocolate sundae with sesame poki sticks and banana tempura, this one was my favorite, but the coconut and passion parfait, pineapple and kiwi fruit simply blowed my daughter's mind away.\nDefinitely Roka, rocks!"}, "1940": {"rating": 4, "review": "This is a sister restaurant to Zuma.

Unfortunately, my last two experiences were sub-par, and the most recent so bad I cannot imagine returning. They've lost their edge, and are no longer worth it. \nActively avoid this place.\nWe made dinner reservations in advance. Within minutes of sitting, we ordered the tasting menu, at their suggestion.  I've had it in the past; it's a large tasting menu, with many courses (twelve?).  The food was generally good, but it took them a long time (30-45 minutes?) to start serving us, and once they did, it was very, very rushed.  We were eating very quickly--even by American standards, and by European standards it was a flat-out race to finish.\nToward the end, they were bringing us multiple courses simultaneously, and taking away dishes before we could finish them.  Finally, they brought the desert--which looked pretty. I wish I could report on how it tasted.\nUnfortunately, as they brought the desert, they also informed us that they had people waiting for our table, and they needed us to leave. They acted as though we had done something wrong. This before we'd even had a chance to eat our dessert! We pointed out to the manager that we had been eating as quickly as they served us, and that we wanted to finish the meal.\nNow, here's the crazy part--the manager actually came and took our desert away while we were eating it, informing us that it was time to leave!\nSo here's my response:\nWe did not design their tasting menu. We ordered the most expensive item on their menu, and ate it as fast as they delivered it. It is not our fault they took a long time to get started, nor that they are booking tables too closely together given the menu they have designed, and their ability to serve it.\nWe didn't expect them to take as long to serve the meal as they did (2.5 hours total). And I hate feeling rushed by a restaurant who clearly cannot get their own act together.  But to actually come to the table and remove food, which they've charged us for, and tell us (in front of our guests) that we had to leave because they had booked the table, is simply inexcusable.  \nHey Roka: if you want your tables turned more frequently, don't take so long to start serving, and don't design and recommend a menu that you cannot serve in the time allotted!\nThe food is okay.  \nThe price is very high (\u00a3120 per person, without alcohol).\nThe service sucks.  \nAvoid."}, "1955": {"rating": 4, "review": "My friend and I decided to check out Fitzrovia and we happened upon Roka.

The prices of the dishes add up very quickly!\nAs a side note, the menu on Roka's website is not inclusive of everything they offer. They have a much larger selection than what is noted on the website.\nWith 12.5% service included in the bill, our table of 4's bill was \u00a3225 which included food, one glass of wine, one mixed drink, one bottle of Coke (200ml), and one bottle of sparkling water.\nBelow are the dishes we ordered and our thoughts:\n-Edemame - very large serving, nice sea salt on top\n-Spicy tuna maki - the smallest rolls I've ever seen but excellent (nice crusty touch on the rice)\n-Chicken and spring onion skewers - our favorite\n-Salmon - excellent\n-Sea bream - too meaty for our taste\n-Sea bass - good but as a warning, it is served with skin on (deboned)\n-Beef dumplings - excellent\n-Lamb - excellent\n-Duck - chewy, would not order it again, left all but two thin slices\n-Chili beef - excellent\n-BBQ ribs - very little meat, would not order again\n-Chicken wings - even less meat than the ribs, tiniest wings I've seen\n-Steamed rice - nice serving size, cooked well, needed salt (no salt or pepper on the table)\n-Asparagus - grilled to perfection\n-Broccoli - cooked perfectly, excellent taste\nThe only reason why I did not rate Roka with 5 stars is:\n1. Serving utinels are not provided with the dishes, so you are forced to use your chopsticks or cutlery to cut off pieces or scrape pieces off skewers (e.g. asparagus). My husband and I met his friend and her husband for dinner and it was a bit strange to have everyone's cutlery touching all the food, especially since this was the first time I had met them.\n2. There is not enough room on the table for all the dishes, so staff was constantly moving plates around to make more room for the additional dishes as they were coming out of the kitchen. Perhaps it is just me but they always seemed to move my water glass or another dish near my right forearm, so my arm was either always almost knocking over my water or rubbing in one of the dishes. They need to invest in some sort of tiered structure in the middle of the table that can swivel. The table was too cluttered and it was impossible to pass dishes around as there was nowhere to set them after you have taken your portion off the plate.\nOverall, excellent experience. The nicest restaurant we have eaten at in London after having lived here for a year."}, "2003": {"rating": 4, "review": "3 words: BOTTOMLESS BUBBLY SUNDAY\nI probably shouldn't be saying this out loud as it's pretty lethal. Basically you add \u00a325 per person on the tap and we definitely made the most out of the \u00a325. I think they might've stationed a staff at our table just to refill our glasses because it was constantly filled. \nDrinks aside, food was good. Standard Azumi restaurants quality. Fish was fresh, I've had more buttery yuzu cod, more flavorful tuna tartare and fattier o-toro from the same chain. But nonetheless really fab food by London jap food standard. I loved their fried eggplant dish. It's so simple and delicious. The green tea molten cake was also surprisingly good and I love how watching green juice gushing out of my dessert makes me feel like an extra-celestial being. \nSo yes, overall 4-star because they made my sunday afternoon absolutely fabulous. It won't make a 5-star because I'm an uber-snob when it comes to Jap food.

The menu is varied and as with all these sorts of restaurants best eaten shared with a group of people - the whole place has got a social vibe. For a little bit more romance ask to sit downstairs in the shochu lounge where the feel is totally different, red and black, soft sofas, big cocktail bar and pretty much the same awesome food as upstairs. \nRoka has won loads of awards which is cool but in sometimes the place itself can seem overrated or hyped by the media.

Overall it is excellent sushi and Japanese cuisine; however, you'll pay for it.  The Canary Wharf location is located on the third floor of an office building overlooking a nice park / square.\nThe decor is nice - they have a very unusual cut outs in their wood paneling around the restaurant.  It has a very modern and hip feel, which is designed to appeal to the Bankers on expense account.\nService is efficient, especially by London standards.  The waiters and waitresses come by often to replenish drinks and check in on the table.

Their blackened cod is particularly good - it comes served marinated in miso and served on top of a banana leaf.  The sashimi is good - the fish is definitely fresh.  The rolls are not that great - but then I'm spoiled by LA sushi.\nPrices are high - aimed at people who wear Rolexes and have expense accounts.

I think without a doubt that Roka is one of the best restaurants in London!!\nWe originally had a reservation for a table in the lounge downstairs, but one look at it and I asked to be reseated upstairs.

In Scottsdale, the sashimi in the premium tasting menu includes top fish like toro whereas the London restaurant served salmon and tuna. Don't get me wrong, what did arrive from the London kitchen tasted great and I would wholly recommend a meal there but in comparison to the Scottsdale restaurant, it just came up a notch short.\nThe tasting menu allows a variety of dishes to be tried and is probably a good introduction for those new to Japanese food. Presentation is beautiful with the signature Roka trick of presenting the fresh food on huge chunks of ice carved from a block at the bar.\nMy personal favourite dishes were the scallop skewers - the scallops were huge and sweet and given a kick from the spices. The lamb cutlets with Korean spices were also tender and yummy.

It might be something simple like ramen, or something special like hokkaido hotpot. So, when you go to Roka, look at the grill, look back at the menu and order something that will come off the grill. I have had the tastiest asparagus ever experienced from that grill. Lamb chops, smoky and marinated in a lovely sauce, amazing. And from the grill.

Very attentive and quick with their service. The food came out at the speed of light.\n~ Food:\nWe ordered both pork and pork and crab XLB - both of them were really great and juicy, but the broth inside was just OK. I much preferred the pork and crab to the pork-only because the crab added an extra dimension of flavour that took their XLB to the next level. Overall, I liked their Xiao Long Bao but if you're a self-proclaimed XLB connoisseur like me you should keep searching.\nDownsides: Ordered their custard buns, it wasn't custard but salted duck yolk (which I like, but definitely not custard so I don't know why they advertised it as such). Also, they don't offer Chinese hot oil at all unfortunately, only soy sauce and vinegar. Not too great if you're into hot oil like I am.\n---\nI like Dumplings Legend.

Wantons large but not cooked enough.  All the other dishes were under cooked. The barbecue pork buns were over flavored with hoisin sauce and undercooked. The Chang-fen with prawn , again undercooked. The Cantonese shrimp dumplings. Same issue. Fell apart trying to serve. Minced pork and crab soup-Mai tasted like shrimp instead and pork undercooked and grizzly.

So again I explained to her we just wanted dim sum, hence the sign outside said they served dim sum. Yet there was no sign that said we had to order a certain \"amount\" to dine there. Mgr was very rude about the situation and said we had to order food from the main menu on top of the dim sum menu.. so instead of causing a scene I told her to her face out loud that this was unexceptionable and I've never been anywhere in the world where I was treated this way.

If the 5th was a real addition, I'd tell them to go eat at a competitor's.  \nThe hostess (NOT THE BARTENDER) should have just asked for clarification, not yell at the customer and [figuratively] spit in our faces.

The interior is sleek and modern, very neutrally white but feeling a bit soulless.\n We of course ordered a basket of 8 xiao long baos, and were not disappointed - they were good, although nothing extremely special. Having dined at Leong's Legends round the corner, I think the xiao long bao there are better - with a richer filling and thinner dumpling skin.\n We also ordered beef noodles and pork chop noodles to go with the dumplings, and were really disappointed with them. When the noodles came they looked pathetic - a big bowl of tasteless broth, with some noodles and limp stalks of vegetables swimming inside. The pork chops were average (again, Leong's Legend was better). The beef soup came in a separate bowl to be poured over the noodles - the bowl was way too hot to lift to pour, so we had to resort to using the spoon to slowly transfer the soup and beef over.\n Overall, a very disappointing experience, and we shall definitely not be going back again.

Xiao Long Bao are large steamed dumplings - a bit like classic dim-sum  with the robust and earthy flavours of salted pork, turnip and spring onions. There were many Chinese diners there, often young, but also prosperous and (I imagine) either students or workers in Chinese enterprises setting up in London.

Unfortunately we were seated right next to the washing up station for small porcelain bowls and spoons  the noise!

And by and large that is what the facilities are, but there is a sense of things starting to look worn (stair carpet) and cluttered (all those notices haphazardly stuck to the walls at the waiters' ordering terminals). What's needed is a Mary Portas style ruthless makeover  keeping the best of what is there and improving what isn't so good.

To my disappointment, they didn't have dumplings on the menu, instead they had Xiao Long Baos, which are stuffed Shanghai buns. Was it that difficult to get the name right? Dumplings are dumplings and buns are buns, they are different things. Dumplings originated from Beijing whilst Xiao Long Baos are from Shanghai, they made in completely different ways. It's like calling a haggis a Cumberland sausage this has already got me started on the wrong note.\n I scanned down the menu and was left confused because most of the dishes were Cantonese, but there were some Malay curries and some Szechuan cold starters. I really didn't know what to order, so I suggested we order something my friends haven't tried before. So we ordered vegetarian Xiao Long Baos, drunken chicken, Malay chicken curry and a vegetable dish.\n To be fair, the vegetarian Xiao Long Baos were nice  they were well made, nicely seasoned and had tasty filling. But rest of the dishes were just bog standard China town. I had hoped with the opening of places like Bar Shu and Empress of Szechuan (though both Szechuan style food) signalled the arrival of more authentic Chinese food but Legend just felt like a step backwards.

Reading comments on my post about LL's excellent Siu Loung Bao (or Xiao Long Bao) brought on cravings. It was time to investigate the newbie's offerings.\n On the site of the former Golden Harvest, the downstairs room is large and airy with white walls and minimalistic touches. It's fresher looking than some of its neighbours - quite like an Asian St John's in terms of decor. We were lucky to be seated at the front, where the whole wall is a window and the sunshine flitted in over our lunch as we watched the characters of Chinatown amble by. Upstairs is more poky, but does the job.\n We arrived about 2pm - prime time it seems. The dining room was packed and a small queue was growing rapidly. However, 3 dumpling makers were at work behind a glass panel at the entrance, rolling, folding and stuffing delicate dumpling wrappers. It's mesmerising to watch while you wait - although I do wonder how long it takes before RSI sets in.\n \"Whatever\", you say. To the food, the food...\n Our knobbly cheung-fun arrive first - three generous, slinky, slug-like noodles stuffed with ample slices of sea bass and picked vegetables. A fair price at \u00a33.30. The next table orders the spicy stir fried cheung-fun which looks good and appears to be a popular choice around the room.\n Steamed sticky rice in a bamboo tube is delicious but so thick it borders on congealed - a decent set of biceps is required to scoop it out (\u00a34.50).\n Barbecued pork buns are excellent - fluffy and filled with big, juicy splashes of sweet, red barbecued meat (3 for \u00a32.50).\n Crystal prawn dumplings are small, pretty things, sweet and plump - but nothing which stands out above the norm here (\u00a32.50). Chicken wrapped in banana leaf with Chinese is a highlight - deliciously moist, with satisfying chunks of chicken and Chinese sausage (\u00a32.20).\n Finally, out come the pork Siu Loung Bao, for which Leong's Legends are renowed (\u00a36.00). At Dumplings' Legend, they're also fantastic - the little smurf's hut shaped wrapper is quite delicate and so you have to be careful not to pierce it, spilling broth onto the table. It snuggles a parcel of meat within as well as a warm soupy broth which explodes into your mouth on first bite. These should be an essential part of your dim sum order here. The accompanying soy sauce contains thick slithers of shredded ginger - a lovely touch.\n We finish with a serve of 3 tiny egg tarts (\u00a32.20) - these are TPG's thing more than mine. They're nothing special, but I quite like the fact they don't taste overly eggy,\n Service is efficient and friendlier than you might experience at some Chinatown restaurants. We paid around \u00a315 per head including tea and service, although we could have done with 1 less dish and 1 less pot of tea (at \u00a32.20 each) had we not been feeling so greedy.\n Both Leong's Legends and Dumplings' Legend highlight their \"highly recommended\" dishes with 2 stars on the menu. Interestingly, \"Legends specialties\" are distinguished with 1 star. I'm not sure what the distinction means.\n Dumplings' Legend is good, and it's already popular.

This evening turned out to be not only a feast of some delicious and some not so great food, but was also hugely educational as I learned a lot from Mr. Noodles about Chinese culture, food and restaurants. Dumpling Legend which is located in the heart of Chinatown has opened some time last year and specialises, as the name promises, in dumplings. To experience the extensive dim sum menu, you have to come before 5 pm (dim sum are traditionally eaten for breakfast and lunch). I refer you to this mouth-watering review by Greedy Diva for more information about eating dim sum at Dumpling Legend. The restaurant is extremely brightly lit. This is good for taking pictures but not that flattering for teint and wrinkles (not that I have any of course!), so I would not necessarily recommend it for the first or second date to be honest. The menu depicts a happy Chinese dumpling with a little crown. Without wanting to be mean, if I had a restaurant I would not entrust my marketing campaign to the people who created this cheerful ball reminiscent of an onion As Mr. Noodles and I are both working hard in our non-blogging related day jobs to be able to afford eating out all the time, we only managed to meet up in the evening and therefore had to choose from the evening menu with a limited dim sum selection. Mr. Noodles pointed out that Dumpling Legend does not appear to specialise in a speficic Chinese cuisine, as the dishes on the menu stemmed from Canton, Sichuan, Malaysia and Taiwan. Mr. Noodles chose the dishes. He ordered a very interesting mix of starters and mains, however, we got them served all at the same time. I didn't like this at all. Firstly, you expect dishes to be served one after the other when they are stated as 'starter' and 'main' in the menu (otherwise why bother doing this?) and secondly, we really had to rush to eat everything while it was still hot/warm. The meal therefore started with a huge minus for Dumpling Legend In summary, the dishes were a rather mixed bag of delicious, OK and not very good. The supposed starters: I rather enjoyed the Cucumber in Chilli Oil (\u00a34) which is a typical Sichuan dish. The fresh and cold cucumber and the hotness of the sauce provided an interesting contrast. The Sweet Potato Fried with Salted Egg Yolk (\u00a34.50) did not taste very Chinese in my opinion and was strangely addictive. Somehow reminded me of the zucca fritta at Zucca. Very successful were the Sichuan-style Spicy Won-ton (\u00a34.50). The delicious savoury filling was wrapped into light won ton skin and came with plenty of mouth-tingling chili sauce. We did fight a little over those A real Chinese specialty are the Pork Crab Meat Siu Loung Bao (\u00a36.50). When I ate Siu Long Baos for the first time at Leong's Legend I burnt my mouth terribly as this type of dim sum contains not only solid fillings but also hot soup. The version at Dumpling Legends did not look very pretty but tasted heavenly. Mr. Noodles taught me how to eat them and I want to share this knowledge with you to save you from injury. You grab one of the dumplings with your chopsticks and bite into it holding it over one of the big Chinese spoons. Then you can enjoy the dumpling and afterward savour the soup collected in the spoon. A real disappointment were the Steamed Prawn Dumplings (\u00a36). Again they did not look very appealing but in this case this also applied to the taste. The skin was too thick and the filling tasteless. Stay away from these! The dishes we had wanted as mains:I have never eaten Taiwanese Three-cup Chicken (with soy sauce, sesame oil & rice wine) (\u00a39.50) so I did not have much comparison but for Mr Noodles this was the most disappointing part of the meal. According to him, this dish, if done well, is extraordinarily delicious. This one clearly wasn't. The chicken was kind of slimy, the sauce tasted only of soy sauce and I could not pick up any sesame oil. Overall this dish lacked any redeeming qualities. You wouldn't think that something as delicious as the Seabass Fillet Steamed with Soy Sauce (\u00a317.50) can come from the same kitchen as the unsuccessful 3 Cup Chicken: Wonderfully tender sea bass with Chinese spring onions and ginger in a light and tasty soy broth was my favourite dish of the evening. I had a similarly delectable Chinese sea bass at Goldfish City close to Bank. The other two mains clearly did not rock my boat. The Stir-fried Choi-sum with Garlic (\u00a37.80) was not too bad but did not leave any lasting impression. Celebrating the Chinese New Year you have to eat noodles as noodles represent longevity. Also when you go out with Mr Noodles you have to eat noodles, but I think you would have guessed that much :) . The Fried Wide Rice Noodles with Beef (\u00a37.50) were boring and insipid. I mixed them with the chili sauce coming with"}, "2181": {"rating": 1, "review": "Shrimp wonton soup-ok. Dumplings are kind of like Din Tai Fung, but saltier and not as good. The rest of the dim sum- terrible and salty.  I swell up and get a bad headache if I consume too much msg.  I swelled up and had a bad headache right after eating here. Just coincidence?  I think this place should only be visited by people who are not sensitive to msg, salt, and taste..."}}
