    "review": "In my younger days when lunch choices consisted of Soho's wide range of eateries as opposed to today's regimented packed lunches, there was one spot that was a consistent favourite. Wong Kei. This evening after a long day at work followed by a lengthy meeting and beer, I decided to revisit my favourite old haunt. It's as good as ever. I ordered my standard:\n- Ho fun with beef and scrambled egg\nIt is a dish that sums up my love for the restaurant; hearty, authentic, homestyle cooking that will fill you up on a budget with the finest of ingredients - simplicity. There is nothing fancy about a plate of wet noodles with a generous helping of tender beef and eggs. Its taste is mildly salty with a slight spring onion sweetness and there isn't much else to it. What you get however is a sense of warmth and comfort with every bite that few other places can offer at its price point. Wong Kei has long been infamous for its abrasive staff and unassuming environment (both things I have no problems with personally) but in dishes such as this, it provides care in the way it feeds you. It in some ways encapsulates the very Chinese way of expressing love without words and not many people appreciate that, or open themselves up to notice such things at places like this.\nI will forever love this place and hope it stays forever. As a little pro tip, this has to be consumed eating in to make use of the plentiful chilli oil crucial to this dish and for that rarest of perks by today's standards: free tea.\nWong Kei, please don't change."

    "review": "After going through yelp and tripadvisor, I wanted to try a Chinese restaurant in London. This place was definitely very popular on tripadvisor and people describe this as good food but bad service. So that's what I think of authentic Chinese food - good food but lack of service is normal! \nSo I decided to check out this place since we were in this area and I heard lots about it. The menu has lots of different choices and variety. We ordered the fu-king fried rice, malaysian noodles. The food came out and I wasn't amazed by it. It was your typical Chinese food. I am not really sure if I like it enough to come back though. Everyone seemed to really love this place and the food but the food doesn't live up to the hype.\nSo bleh. Just Chinese food.\nAlso, I was surprised we had shared tables. So if you have a small party, they might sit you with a shared table, I don't know how common it is in London? I see shared tables as a norm in Asia/China though but not usually that common in America."

There are several floors, and someone will direct you to a table. \nFood: It's simple and straightforward. The roasts hanging in their window are done well - duck, BBQ pork, roast pork. I had the pork and century egg congee, with a side of roast park. Congee was full of meat and egg, and had the right amount of ginger. The roast pork was fresh, with a crispy skin, and the meat was tender and not dry. \nService: Food comes out quickly, and you'll be left alone to enjoy it. Reasonably attentive if you need something. \nCost: The two items with tea cost me \u00a317.50. \nOverall: It isn't fancy, but it does offer some decent food at decent prices."

Both the food and the service, we have one friend who just had an injury on her leg so we asked if we can eat at the ground floor to avoid climbing the stairs. The waiter rudely checked my friend's leg to see if I am lying, we almost left because of it. \nIn the end my friend didn't want to ruin the mood so we still stay. Fortunately we sat at the ground floor as we asked but one of the guy in the counter gave us a disgust look. ( there were plenty of sits in the restaurant at the time we were really unsure why they make it so difficult) \nThe food was as terrible as the service, the rice was cooked with just too much water, the rice stick together like a rice ball, we didn't finish the rice. The grilled duck I had was ok but not crispy at all if you are looking for authentic Cantonese cuisine. The waiter who helped us to order was nice though, but the food and the main service is horrible. Skip this place if you can."

The colours on dishes and tea sets may be worn, I have found lipstick on a cup before, hair on the plate of food, etc. \nHaving grown up in London and been a frequent visitor of Chinatown I have known what to come to expect of Wong Kei, and that is not to expect much in terms of quality but you can be fed with speed and at low prices compared to all its competitors in Chinatown. \nMany locals can feel at ease eating here even on their own (unless you feel embarrassed to have anyone you know spot you eating here). It is basically cheap (and not so cheerful) but it does its job and has served a useful purpose in London's Chinatown for many decades."

I ordered a rice plate with barbecue meats (pork belly, pork), which should have been the fastest dish at my table, since the bbq meats are cold and just placed on top of the rice, but for some reason my plate was the last to reach the table by far. A good amount of meat and a good amount of sauce over rice for a standard dinner. Prices are pretty decent too, I think around 6 pounds for my plate. Cash only."

    "review": "--- American tourist ----\nWong Kei is A very  typical old fashion Chinatown restaurant. Very old furniture, very working class, not trendy, not cool, \"you get the best value here\" attitude of service. BUT I highly recommend it!\n1. Price is damn good for most chow fun, fried noodles and soup noodles. Cheaper than the United States Chinatown in NY and SF. For other dishes, prices are average NOT cheap.\n2. Roast duck is very good but NOT as good as Four Seasons around the corner which still has the BEST duck in London!  Half duck with NO bone is 11.5 pounds at Wong compared to 14.5 pounds with NO bone at Four (number may be off slightly but conclusion is the same). If you want the best duck, go to FOUR.\n3. The wonton soup at Wong is average. Soup is meaty, little salty and not clear, not very tasty. Good wonton soup should be clear and strong with seafood (shrimp) taste. Wonton itself is average average although each one has a big piece of shrimp! It could have some MSG in it and it will taste a lot better!\n4. Beef stew flat noodle soup is not bad and it is very vinegary. This type of strew is not common in Cantonese style. \n5. Tea is FREE.\nBathroom is acceptable marginally. Service is ok, not great.\nBottom line, good authentic Cantonese noodles restaurant BUT with very affordable prices earns Wong Kei  ****.\nCASH ONLY, BUDDY!"

The table next to us was eating Peking duck, and the duck looked like it had been hacked by an amateur. \nService is where it gets bad. They looked mad when we asked for extra bowls and chopsticks. And, when we asked to \"add tea\", the waiter looked at us in disbelief and said \"add tea??\" He then took away our tea pot and didn't return it for the duration of our meal. \nWhat kind of Chinese restaurant is surprised that it's customers drink tea? Tea is like, all Chinese people drink. \nFinally, the servers got mad when we walked up to the counter to pay, as if they were afraid we were going to run. As we left, a server was arguing with a customer, who yelled that the server \"didn't know how to treat women.\" The server just stood smugly at the door with his arms crossed and didn't let those customers in. We didn't get the whole deets but you get the point, service is terrible. \nTo be honest, when I look back at this experience, it's so ridiculous it's funny."

The floors stunk of chlorine going upstairs. Then we were seated at a \"shared table\" when there were plenty of smaller tables for 2 downstairs. There were also tables of 4 upstairs which I was told when we asked to be seated alone. We were on our honeymoon after all. We walked out, absolutely appalled by this service. This separation would never happen in a Canadian Chinatown. Disgusting - what way to turn away customers.  No matter how good the food, this is not ethically ok and clearly for appearances sake only.

I'm only here for the food! and then I looked over at the gaggle of staff hanging around the bar and then one stuck two fingers at me lazily (basically indicating a table for two) and I said yes and then he waved us off in the direction of the stairs. He didn't escort us upstairs nor did he come to the front to greet us. It felt very self service, almost empowering :D \nWe then helped ourselves to the best table of 4 after realising there weren't a table for 2 around but the waitress hurriedly ushered us to a 'table for two' which we later realised was a shared table with another two customers!!!?? I tried to protest but in vain as the waitress was having none of it. Honestly, the whole concept of customers are always right and you must prioritise customer's needs before anything else are completely foreign to these people. \nThe other two customers were as surprised as we were but later whispered that at least we all got into the exclusive dining area normally reserved for Chinese folks and as a Chinese myself, I got my non asian friend a free pass to the exclusive club which had linen covered tables with comfy enough seats compared to the greasy cheap looking mish mash of tables and chairs downstairs.\nWe were so fortunate that our fellow neighbours were such cool peeps and abit like the shared benches in Wagamama, we were like 'can you pass the soya sauce please?' etc. I mean I totally would've shared their food too (if they'd let me). Totally. Love the fact that Wong Kei forces us to interact with complete strangers. Such a unique perk. Also they know the issues with London's first world problems in their lack of communication with one another and has set itself on a mission to break these barriers. ;-) So admirable!\nOur neighbours even helpfully smacked down some annoying flies and wiped it off the table for us. :') The flies acted as a bonus decoration ;-) The authenticity in this restaurant to the Far East is so in tune. You want abit of China? Go to Wong Kei!!  \nIf a food restaurant other than your typical Mcdonald's and Burger King, offers a drive through speedy service then this is it! The whole service was comparable to a factory conveyer belt. Time is precious and every second counts despite the fact that the restaurant was half empty with ample amounts of unoccupied tables and chairs scattered across the floor. Compared to your typical Chinatown establishment, this one takes the prawn cracker! As soon as we were seated and handed our menus, a waitress hovered above waiting to take our order (like less than a minute after we sat down). When I asked her to come back in a few minutes, the look on her face was utter shock. Truly funny to see. Honestly our table was wicked. We interacted with our neighbours and made such jokes that the same waitress came back looking horrified with nose flaring, that we were enjoying ourselves lol. \nNow onto the food. This is what I came for. Prices have gone up ever so slightly since well, the last recorded menu prices online) but still remain ahead of competition in terms of value, portion and quality. We had hearty meals of won ton noodle soup which was laden with won ton dumplings that when I finally demolished those meat parcels, I was actually surprised to see noodles underneath it! For a fiver, it truly was the epitome of eastern comfort food like bangers and mash is to English folks. For the side, we opted for bean curd with chilli and salt. I would totally recommend it to anyone because once you try it, you can't stop! Might need some water at hand because they don't use that msg sparingly!! \nService is quick. You're in and out of there like fast food. In fact so quick you needn't worry about time. What they lack in service they more than abundantly made up for in quality and quantity of food.\nQuestion of whether you're genuinely welcomed sits in the balance. Service charge is optional (thank goodness!!) and the waitress counted the money at our table (quite insecurely) after hovering nearby for a while whilst we emptied coins from our purses lol! Not to forget that the tea is freeeeee!  \nComing here is an experience onto itself like a ghost ride in a theme park. You love to hate it. All in all, I'd definitely be coming back here in a rush!"

I was asked to meet a few friends here from Hong Kong for dinner before we went to the theatre. They heard it was famous for their bad reputation so they wanted to try it. I personally do not understand why they came all the way from Hong Kong to the UK to have Chinese food, but there is neither here or there. \nFood: If there's food in front of me, I'll eat it! I completely forgot what we ordered, but my friend pouted and said they all looked the same: stir-fried bbq pork, stir-fried vegetables, stir-fried a whole bunch of stuff and deep-fried tofu with chillies. Whatever we ordered, it came quickly and that was a good thing for us because we were in a hurry.\nAtmosphere: It has a typical Chinese cafe-style atmosphere: busy, tacky oriental art, and a slight layer of grease on the wall that comes with a dive like so. Where the chairs are from an 80's diner and the plastic cutlery and crockery has been used so much, their logo is wearing off. If you're looking for 5 star dinning, you've come to the wrong place. If you're looking for fast, cheap eats, look no further than this lovely dive full of oriental tourists getting upset that it's not up to par with their home cooking or Chinese students that miss home and did not want to have instant noodles tonight. \nService: The service wasn't that bad. I do want to say, it was surprisingly good based on their bad reputation. We walked in, told them how many people and were seated accordingly. In typical Chinese fashion, sometimes you may need to wave them down to get some service, but I feel that is the norm for busy restaurants."

I didn't even need to read the Yelp reviews to know that I'm going here just for the food and not fancy table service. As soon as I enter, the waiter acknowledges me and tells me to share a table downstairs. Not even seconds later I'm asked if I know what I want. I politely asked for a menu and was given one instantly. That probably my first mistake. You should already know what you want. They run a very tight ship here and I was put on the spot like on the episode of Seinfeld where the Soup Nazi was scolding patrons for taking too long in the soup line and sent to the back for not following his rules. I settled on the roast duck noodle soup and it came faster than you can say, \"Long live the queen\". The food was delicious, the service was meh. The locals seem to come here a lot and don't mind.

For me, the brusqueness of the staff translates to efficiency which I would take any day over ineptitude and slowness which drives me mad.\nIt was the first time I've been back since the re-opening or new management or whatever happened. On this occasion I was dining solo (always a good spot for solo dining) and was immediately directed to one of the solo dining tables right in the entrance area. The waiter came straight over and asked me what I wanted. I kind of like that, taking me for a regular because if I did know, I would just say right away. I asked for a menu instead since it had been a while...\nI ordered a wonton soup and singapore noodles. Pretty straightforward.\nMy order came quickly and I was surprised to see that the wonton soup was a large bowlful with plenty of wontons which were really good. Prawn and pork, freshly made with big chunks of prawn with a good ginger note. It made me think how good this was especially for the price around \u00a33.50 vs the \u00a311 bowls of ramen noodles that have sprung up everywhere (was never comfortable with paying \u00a311 for a bowl of soup noodles).\nSingapore noodles also didn't scrimp on the meat and shrimp and a good sized portion. A bit overly salty not helped by the salty soup but overall solid.\nComplimentary tea.\nSo.

On my own, within waving distance of one of my friends, but I had to muscle in on another couple who had been lucky enough to sit together. \nIt took sometime to get a waiter's attention, but it didn't take long to realise that the couple I'd been proffered to give my services to as a third wheel and Capering Gooseberry, had not just been stuck for conversation, but were simply too frightened to ask for; water, a napkin or anything else you'd usually expect at a restaurant. \nFinally a waiter, dashed to my attention. \n\"Drink?\"\nJust as I flicked my eyes down to the menu to enquire, he was off. Fed up by my too long split second hesitation. \nThe food came quickly, in fact when it did arrive it almost hit the linen before the plates did. \n\"Noodles\", my waiter announced. *Slam* \"Chilli Beef\" *Slam*. Down went the bowls, whilst before they hit the table, the broth defied gravity remaining in mid-air and began cooling from the gust of wind created from the clipped turn of my waiter's back again.\nHe'd gone! Thank Christ, but I'd still not ordered my drink. I saw a couple of my friends separated over on two other tables making perplexed gestures to me in nervous fits of laughter. I thought they were having a good time, but I was to discover their waitress did not linger, who's laconic tone implied she too could give even less of a rat's rear about my or their whining on about being thirsty. In the end she abandoned herself from their table for mine, offered me a drinks menu and rolled her eyes so hard I thought it'd affect the gravitational pull of the moon.  So I did the darnedest of things and ordered what was to be a flat sodding cola. \nWell, if you must hanker for Anglicised greasy run of the mill Chinese food, go here, go simply for the terrifying experience and GO ON, GET OMLETTE AND CHIPS I DARE YOU!"

For our main, my husband had crisply beef and I had the spicy aubergine. The service was quite good. We did meet several wait staff.

    "review": "I admit it, I go to Wong Kei... and I LIKE it!\nSo they closed and reopened, and some things have changed. The prices went up a little (not by that much), although the portions are the same, the staff got a little friendlier and service just a tad slower. But what's important remains the same. It's a place where you can get a plate of relatively good Chinese food quickly for not a lot of money. It's by no means the best food in the world but it is at a price that's cheaper that the rest. \nBy all means go to the buffets in Chinatown, but unless you eat smart, you're losing out, the drink you have there will push you to the \u00a310 mark... At Wong Kei, eat in, and your tea is free. I don't go for the really elaborate dishes, they specialise in the one plate meal in my opinion, rice or noodles with something on it. Larger plates are a pretty much a plate of the main, and you then order rice on the side, good for groups. I've only once ordered off of their Chef's specials list - udon with seafood and XO, and to my surprise I loved it, but it was expensive, so don't think I'd get it again. That and most of my colleagues didn't really appreciate it...\nSo stick to the basics, don't worry about sitting at the communal table (people, it's meant to zig zag so you're not sitting next to someone, please learn this! Talking to you Mr sweaty businessman who proceeded to elbow me for my meal and cluck that I was in his way - I was there first!).

This was the first sit down restaurant that we headed to in London. \nWe went here for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday evening and were seated on the basement (may be called the ground floor) and service was prompt and efficient. We ordered the eel, hot pot with tofu and Singapore style thick rice noodles. Hubs loved the eel since this is not something we have in the USA or at least in Michigan and ate all but two pieces. The tofu hot pot had fish tofu as well as the regular braised tofu. As is typical with everywhere but the US, the hot pot was smaller than what I was expecting but tasted on par with the average hot pot. Lastly, the Singapore thick noodles were pretty tasty, but I found the curry flavor be not as strong as it's done in the states. The flavor was still good and contained mini shrimps, BBQ pork, onions, and sprouts. \nGiven the price of around 25\u00a3, it's a great place to grab a reasonably priced, some may even say cheap eat when you are looking for a Chinese fix in London."

    "review": "Okay first off, this place is awesome. You're might think that it's probably awesome because of the food. Wrong. Or that it's awesome because of the service. Nope. Or that it's nostalgia from child-hood days (You might be right). But overall no. It's pretty much the best place in Chinatown because of the no fuss (read: efficient) service, down and dirty, give the customer what they ordered and with complimentary tea. No service charge, but it does go appreciated so leave what you can.\nWhat elevates it above most other place, is the chilli oil. Hands down the best chilli oil in all of chinatown. Nobody else does it. Nobody else has re-created it. I have literally eaten here and nearly eaten half a glassful of the stuff. I know that's probably not a badge to be proud of, but it is just that good and I probably wouldn't eat here as the food is nothing special without it. Cheap, but not special.\nRecently however, they've started raising the prices a little and portions are quite variable. You used to always get a gigantic (how do I finish this) portion. But nowadays you could get that, or get something a little more manageable. This said, The price of the dish I always get, either the shredded chicken/pork fried noodles (always make sure you get crispy noodles) or the belly pork/bbq pork on hot rice have increased from \u00a33.80 and \u00a34.00 a decade ago to \u00a34.80 and \u00a35.00 today. Take into account inflation and this is probably a below inflation increase, you still get unlimited tea and the amazing chilli which haven't changed a bit.\nIf you're a wetherspoon snob however, and you know who you are, you absolutely won't like this place and this review won't convince you otherwise. For others that like to give new things and try and risk poor service/variable quality good, Wong Kei is great, you just have to understand how it all works. What appears rude service on your first visit is actually efficiency engineered over many decades. After all, if you're there on your own sitting at the front, why would they give you a menu?? You should already know what you want, and most people do!\nPS. Like other budget chinatown places. Cash Only. They also do takeaway. I kid you not, sometimes you can get this from ordering to in your hand in less than 45 seconds. They give you a little container of chilli oil, but do it properly. Open up your chinese foil takeaway box and add more yourself."

    "review": "Apparently it's been a long time since the good old days of waiters telling you to piss off because there's a queue outside and being amusingly rude. Anyway, they're still reasonably priced (cash only, folks) and the food remains good. I wouldn't say it's a life changing culinary experience, but it usually delivers and I never had to send anything back. The trick is to order food from the back of the menu; basically lots of options of meat with rice or noodles. It's even cheaper and the portions are huge; you won't miss out for not ordering the \"posher\" sounding dishes on the first few pages.\nI can't stand green/jasmine tea, but if that's your thing you'll get it for free to your heart's content. There are some communal round tables where you sit in close proximity with strangers; if that's not your thing keep in mind it's always a risk. :)\nIf you want a chatty and smiley staff this is not the place to go (as it happens with most chinese places where staff is usually tired and overworked anyway), but if you like quick and good chinese food in central London, do try. I love sitting there during off peak hours with my tablet and munch on rice and meat while I people watch. There are always some amusing customers around, and sometimes the interaction between them and the staff isn't so smooth. Ah, the good old Wong Kei will always be the good old Wong Kei. ;)"

I still shake my head because I have no idea what I was thinking. I know I like the eel sushi, so how different could it be?\nI have no doubt that it was good, for being eel. It was served extremely hot and after a few minutes of waiting for it to cool down, I picked up a slice with the chopsticks. Do you eat the skin? Oh, there's bone in there too. It was messy. It was... interesting. It was... odd. Would I have it again? I think I can safely say I would have something else, though I would absolutely return to the Wong Kei.

The food tasted okay and the prices were average. My only real problem with my experience was the stingy portion sizes of our dishes. I'm used to the whole mostly rice, very little meat thing that asian restaurants do, but the value at Wong Kei compared to what you can get elsewhere in London straight up bad. As a tourist from a small Canadian city with superior Chinese restaurants (in my humble opinion), I gotta say... Londoners deserve better and shouldn't have to pay ridiculously high prices for half decent service/food when it comes to Chinese."

Purely relying on cheap prices to fill seats in your restaurant?\nWith this as their business model, I will always have a soft spot for Wong Kei!\nThe first time that I ever came here, I was introduced to the place by a friend of my dad's when I was still in my teens. I really did not know what to expect. Upon returning with my best friend, he and I spent the evening completely perplexed as to what was going on around us, even though we were the customers and we were the ones who were placing the orders. We most definitely were not in control or command of what was happening to us! \nI seem to remember almost random dishes appearing with no explanation as to what they were. I also remember very well ordering portions of egg fried rice and the waiting staff slamming the bowl down and me repeatedly asking where the other portion of rice was. Each time I asked, the waiter immediately started walking away and shouted at me \"You got it!\" \nAfter grabbing a more senior member of staff, he finally explained that two portions is one bowl. Thanks for that!\nSo when I returned here very recently, I was wondering if they still had \"the same magic\" that they used to.\nWell, to be brief. Prices have most definitely escalated compared to what they used to be here. However, you most definitely get great value for your money. I can most definitely eat & eat & eat. And.... The relatively few dishes that I did order really challenged my eating prowess. \nService here is still fairly crazy. But I suppose, it is all about perspective. I personally feel that over the last few years service in London has gotten worse and worse. Get me started on this topic I will tell you that it is the fault of including service in the bills, but I'll back off that for now.

    "review": "This whole hype on social media in regards to Wong Kei closing and then opening with new management really got me wanting to go back to see if there has been any changes. \nWong Kei has always been a place for a simple fix of food at a cheap price and a place I can get fresh ho fun stir-fried at a reasonable price. Hate it when people state 'ho fun' in the menu when in fact it's just dried rice noodles rehydrated. Portion sizes is always a plus too along with no service charge and free green tea. But I never expect good presentation of food, wok energy, particularly good service or a very positive memorable experience.\nSo it caught my attention when news coverage was saying that the new manager is trying to input better service. Whilst customers were worried about the change in portion sizes, cheap prices and taste in their favourite chilli oil. So on Saturday me and my friend decided to test this new 'Wong Kei' out with a few of the most popular dishes and see if Wong Kei has lost it's original values.\nAlthough there has been a repaint, decor is still exactly the same, same off green/blue tables on the ground floor, plastic white plates with 'Wong Kei' printed on them. The only thing that looked any diffferent were the soy sauce that are now in Lee Kum Kee glass bottles. \nWe were given the new menu where the dishes looked exactly the same however all dishes were hiked up by 0.20p-0.40p. This certainly gives room for other Chinese restaurants to top Wong Kei in offering the cheapest one dish plates. \nWe started with the most popular Roast pork and pork belly on rice. Either we were very lucky on the occasion with the cut or the meat has improved in quality. I was quite impressed with how lean the roast pork was, succulent and well marinated. The generous slices of meat did have a good bounce to it with a generous portion of rice in the same sweet brown sauce I'm used to. Nothing had changed here, if anything it was better than a lot of times I have been. \nMy friend was so happy to find the chilli oil had not change either, still fragrant with notes of garlic and flavoursome. A spoon of that onto the rice dish add that perfect kick needed to make it a good simple lunch fix.\nMy usual char kway teow went downhill sadly. It was still fresh ho fun but it lacked flavour and depth. It was not as spicy as it used to be and in fact it was more bland than it used to be. There was minimal egg to be seen and portion went down as well. I've heard most of the chefs have left since the new manager took over but no reason was given. That could explain the cooking changes. They must be using a different curry powder or paste to.\nCrispy pork noodles had mix opinions. My friend was sad to find that the noodles had change and are a lot thinner. It didn't effect me as it just made things more lighter and crisper but some might like it with more bite. As a business perspective I can see these noodles being quicker to fry. This actually became my favourite dish of the three as I enjoyed the long shredded pork and the thinly chopped mix vegetables on top that created a good layered of texture. The sauce was seasoned perfectly for me and yes although greasy it was expected, nothing has changed there. \nNow I didn't feel service had change at all- not like it bothered me. But there was no major improvements. Still no smile or polite welcoming. Our waiter still quickly pointed to the back which some can consider rude and asked us to pick any table there. Our female waitress who delivered our food was nicer and answered the majority of our questions given but she seemed genuinely nice and not like she had particular training. \nStill quite intrigued if any other dishes have changed at Wong Kei especially the Wonton Noodle Soup. Still I somehow feel the old Wong Kei is lost and being the most 'cheap' and 'generous' portions in Chinatown is no more. But for it's roast meats, chilli oil and crispy noodles there is a reason for return."

I'm pretty sure the two tables next to me got their food before me despite showing up afterwards. However, being insulted at one is new to me. When I asked the waitress where my food was long after her estimates had passed, she said it's my fault that I'm so impatient because I'm from mainland China. Thanks for assuming that just because I'm a foreigner who can speak Chinese, I'm automatically from China. \nI was also hoping for a break from pricey pubs, but in the end, the total came out to about how much I'd spend at a pub so it wasn't as cheap as I had hoped.

You are equally treated like an inhumanely kept dog, fed only the basic food for sustenance, while sat by some complete stranger that both you and him/her are making it like the other is some white elephant in the room. But you know what? This establishment only cares about two things: feeding you the fastest way possible and getting you out equally as fast so that the process can be repeated with the next human being(s). And that's why I still have love for this joint. \nWK hasn't let me down once. The bar is set (low)."

Probably not the best place to go if you're after quality, attentive customer service but the menu is diverse and you're guaranteed to get tasty dishes that are great value for money. The noodle and rice dishes portions are huge so it's easy to over order but you can always ask for a doggy bag to takeaway!"

    "review": "Not sure how this place gets so many 5 star reviews. It's pretty much quick & dirty Chinese food. I'm not saying this place is dirty (figure of speech), but its cleanliness is on par with a typical cheap Chinese restaurant.\nI've had the Beef Flat Noodle and Slippery Egg & Beef Rice, which were average to below average. Quality was okay, service was pretty nonexistant; just go in, eat, and get out. I did feel slightly rushed here - though it might have been a more psychological thing for me than actual waiters trying to rush us out.\nThe servers seem to give bad service on purpose, but it's all in good fun - as if they're playing a part. They actually aren't rude and quite courteous. I remember one visit I was watching as a waiter kept his eye pinned on a little kid jumping around in a seat. The server mentioned to the family that it was dangerous for the kid (~3 years old) to be jumping on the seat like that, and that it could tip over - which the parents just ignored. The waiter had his eye on the kid whenever he wasn't serving someone else, and would occasionally jerk towards the kid/seat when the kid seemed to be losing his balance. Nice guy - though he told one of our party to get their own chopsticks when asked to get a set of chopsticks (which he did get)."

We awkwardly sat down and said a little hello to our neighbours opposite us, already eating their meal. After they had finished and left, they were replaced by two others. So our date turned out to be not so much a date. We had it good though on our table of 6 with only 4 people. Behind us were an older couple sat opposite two young Indian guys on a four seater table. It looked super cramped and awkward. At least we weren't single diners. The downstairs is reserved for single diners only. I don't know what's worse...being singled out because you're single or being forced to sit within perfect distance to be able to hear the couple opposite whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears whilst we devoured our food.\nOnto the food...We had the deep fried salt and chilli squid which was actually amazing. Not greasy, lightly battered, great flavours. We also had a pork, chicken, duck and vegetable dish which has basically just pork with pak choi. Find duck or chicken and you were lucky. Good sauce though. \nWould we come back? No. Too many other places to try in Chinatown and this one did not stand out. Service was okay compared to what other diners have written. Complimentary tea was nice."

    "review": "I heard of this place through the 2010 Not For Tourists Guide for London and a bunch of London guidebooks, saying that it is one of their recommendations for inexpensive eating in London. I decided to walk inside to grab a lunch and see how they do. \nWhen I got inside, they quickly gave me some tea. The tea was fairly bitter and tasted kind of bland. I don't think the people who work here speak English very well, and I ended up speaking Cantonese Chinese to them. The t-shirts they wore were pretty cool as well. \nI ordered the Fish with tofu over rice. The fish was pretty bony, but there was a decent crisp in the fish, and I thought it was decent at the best. It is not high on my recommendations to order at this place unless you do not mind eating fish meat from the bone. The tofu was pretty good though as well as the rice. The dish also had some Chinese mushrooms and ginger as well. The ginger put some flair into the flavour of the dish, while the mushrooms were pretty tasty. Portions were pretty good and I got my stomach full. As for the prices, most of the dishes were under \u00a39, so it's fairly inexpensive for a city like London. I paid \u00a35.70 for my dish, which is probably the least amount of money I spent for a meal in London so far. \nOverall, this is not a bad place to grab something inexpensive to eat in London and I would not mind coming back here again. However, I would not recommend getting the Fish with tofu over rice."

The food is actually incredibly good for the most part, with some of the best duck soup noodles and soft shell crab locally in my opinion (a lot of the local competitors use a lot of veg in their soup so a lot of the rich duck flavour is lost). It is very good value for money, with massive portions, and is very cheap. You can tell it's cheap from the decor, the tableware and the fact that Wong Kei is infamous for it. Do not expect Western-style service. You will not get it. The waiting staff are very quick and also very to-the-point and for the majority of times I've been there, are not going to faff around. I personally have no problem with this but I know it's not for everyone. If you are a couple, you may be seated at a large table with other people if they're very busy. You could always wait for a smaller table to become available but it could be said to be part of the Wong Kei experience. This has only happened to me once and I've been as a pair several times, usually being seated downstairs on the smaller tables.\nGreat food, great price for said food, and exceptionally fast service."

    "review": "Wong Kei. The best part about this is the name which let's be honest is a bit hilarious. Especially when your aunt keeps saying it in a slightly northern accent. She was raving about the Singapore fried noodles here and since she was the woman of the hour, we went.\nThe place looks like a canteen on a large scale. Not to worry, I thought, the best Chinese places tend to look unimpressive as they care solely about the food. So I said to myself (no I didn't say \"Self\"...I mean who actually does that?) that I'd judge it on the food alone with just a bit on the service.\nThe service overall was pretty good, barring a slight issue at the beginning where they refused to put two tables together (there were roughly 15 of us in the group). Why you ask? No, not because they were too busy or that they didn't' have the tables (they were about half full at best and could easily seat 100 covers), but rather because they \"just didn't do that\". A bit of an odd response for a restaurant to have as I'd imagine keeping 15 hungry diners in a half empty restaurant is a pretty good idea business wise. So we had a mini-standoff between several angry Indian mums and 2 Chinese guys...needless to say the mums won.\nAnyways, finally seated together, I get left with the dubious honour of ordering for the group (as seems to happen more often these days...). Naturally we got several portions of these Singapore fried noodles along with a selection of meat dishes and a roast Peking duck to start.\nThe duck was alright but by no means up to par with that for the Four Seasons (the lovely restaurant in Queensway or Chinatown not the hotel). It has some decent flavour but too much of the fat had been rendered away leaving the meat just a tad dry. We also ran out of pancakes quite quickly and couldn't get the attention of any of the waitstaff to ask for more.\nThe meat dishes we had ordered (the typical staples of Westernised Chinese dining) included beef in black bean sauce, pork in oyster sauce and chilli, cashew chicken, and grilled eel. The eel turned out to be a popular favourite despite not being the melt in your mouth bbq eel I had expected. It was grilled with the skin on and a light flavourful sauce. The skin was too rubbery to really eat but had done an excellent job of protecting the tender meat within. The rest of the dishes could not distinguish themselves from the average Chinese takeout but were satisfying in general.\nFinally, the Singapore noodles. I love my aunt, but I don't know what she was on about with these things. They tasted a bit bland and limp and lacked any of the fiery bite of other such noodle dishes I've tried nor did it have sufficient variety in texture to be appealing. They functioned just fine as a base for other dishes but then again so does egg fried rice. Overall, very disappointed in this but that might be due to the hype as well. \nThoughts: It's cash only so be sure to bring a few notes. Price wise it's pretty decent with the whole meal coming up to around \u00a310pp (which in true asian fashion was fought over with each adult trying to pay for all of it). You can BYOB but they will charge you a corkage fee of \u00a33-5/bottle that they see. So bring a case of identical bottles, just open one, and switch out the empties for a full one whenever the staff aren't around!"

I was surprised, considering it isn't really a canto dish. If you order this, remember to get a rice dish or just a (pretty large) bowl of rice (for about 1.50?)\n- Roast Duck (cold): I didn't particularly like it because it was really fatty (Though I know some people like it) and I found it a bit salty (yet again, some people like that).\n- Yang Zhou Fried Rice: DELICIOUS. haha, get it!\n- Choi Sum w/garlic: pretty good, not what I would say best I've ever had.

Each to their own I guess. \nThe food was delicious and the service okay, but it was annoying to be sat at a table with two pervy older men who sat and drooling over my friend and I for our entire meal and I felt particularly uncomfortable when she went off to the loo and I was left with them. \nWhen it the time came for us to pay our bill, it was annoying to be told that they did not take cards and that we would have to go to the nearest cash point. The waiter even shouted loudly, \"SHE (nodding at me) can go and get money out, whilst YOU (aimed at my friend) wait here.\" We did this after saying, tactfully, how ridiculous it was that they weren't in the 21st Century and didn't have the ability to take card payments. When the waiter was being rude, this was when it was useful that my friend could speak Cantonese as she had a slight, let's call it, debate with the rude waiter. \nGreat location and very convenient, just make sure you come armed with cash and attitude - and you're probably better in a group so then it'll just be you sat on your table!"

The food is great, the service is quick and the quality is fabulous.\nThe thing is about Wonkies and this is whether you like traditional Chinese meals or not there service of feeding people is known all around London and the rest of the world, the prices are reasonable and the restaurant itself has the all the Feng Shui you need to know where you at, what style of food your eating and more importantly you will be able to eat in the knowledge your not being over charged.\nThe grubs great, its always busy and the staff there have been there since day one. This business is making money, and they need to because the overheads down West End are sky rocket.\nThe type of people who eat in this restaurant vary, you have the traditional China town residents, regulars and people like me who venture down West regularly to eat Chinese food. Even if it was not Chinese food I would probably still eat there, because I like Chinese tea (sound familiar?). If so you will love Wonkies as am sure you already know having been there is you get free green tea, not just any old green tea but green tea that helps you clear your palette before eating and green tea that helps you wash down your food.\nIf I have any grumbles about Wonkies it is about the pepper, now it has not happened for a while perhaps because its the summer and the air is much drier but previously I have found the pepper shaker to be blocked. This means simply tapping the pot and sometimes means having to take of the top lid and scrape away the troublesome blocks of pepper, once years ago the pepper fell out onto my food, but anyway I still ate it because I get very hungry. I once invited my pops and brother but unfortunately they declined coming and took me to the pub instead.\nWell what did they miss out on rather than just speaking about the free condiments and wonderful abundance of chopsticks. Sweet and sour is always a favourite with us English. For the health fanatics out there I recommend asking the waiter for greens with your meals, the crispy belly pork is great. The best thing about Wonkies though is the duck is does not matter whether your talking duck pancakes or Duck on rice is all very yummy. Another great meal if your ok with pork and don't mind prawns is a pasta based meal. This meal is called fried Quon Dou its yummy just try it with a huge dollop of the yummy chilli sauce, you will not regret this one the foods great.\nSea lovers ship ahoy there's a great meal that is a set meal with pasta that comes with yummy fish-balls calamari or squid and a yummy spinach based leave to soak up the gooey sauce.\nIf your in two minds about eating Chinese when your down the West End in London and are unsure where to turn or take your large party of hungry friends then Wonkies is where you should turn.\nP.S. Another little tip there is often budget meals on the walls with special that are not necessarily on the menu, there nice but I would not get to distracted the food I spoke of here is well worth checking out for now. If your really adventurous your could try the intestines or the offal dishes but I usually go with what's your normal Chinese grub, but if its a dessert your after your stuffed there are no sweets at Wonkies. Final note yes they do sell Chang beer. Happy eating."

On various visits we have been sat, down down stairs, in the middle bit, in the weirdly more upmarket upstairs bit and now and then in this weird 'down the hallway' bit that takes so long to walk to I think we were actually in Leicester Square by the time we reached our table.\nMore often than not, we order the same set meal for two because it is such a good value (under \u00a38 per person) and because we love everything they serve as part of it. It is served family style and comes with sweet and sour pork, steamed Chinese vegetables, black bean beef ,chicken with mushrooms and a large amount of white rice.. We agree that their sweet and sour pork is the best we have had anywhere. \nDon't get me wrong, Wong Kei's is the 'greasy cafe' variety of Chinese food but since I am a non-flashy type of gal that works great for me. I love the little quirks like the waiters being just the right side of rude, the cheap plastic plates and the luminous pots of chilli sauce that are always sitting on the table.\nIt is wise to have some competence with chopsticks if you eat here but I am sure the waiters that do speak a bit of English would have no problem humiliating you a bit as they found you a fork."

I find the ground floor a nice spot for a single diner and the single plates with BBQ meats or fried or noodles in soup tasty and good value for money.

I find the arrogant waiters ignorant and annoying, and even though Chinese waiters have been known to be a little short, these people have turned rudeness into an art form. As I understand Cantonese, I am also not too happy with some conversations I have overheard.\n I was here several years ago when the decor was \"Paint Peeling Off Wall\". They have since spruced it up a bit so that most of the paint is now actually on the wall. And that is about the best I can say, but this is actually not a criticism as lots of good places in China have somewhat basic decor, or worse.\n The food is not too bad, I have to admit, especially for the price, so if you want to eat well and reasonably cheaply, then this is definitely one place to consider. However, this place was a lot cheaper years ago. By the way, NEVER order the set menus - they are invariably crap and made up mostly of food they couldn't sell the day before.\n But whatever you do, please don't bother leaving a tip for the waiters - as they say, they don't expect it and it will only embarrass them! :o)"

The food is standard Cantonese noodle house fare, though unlike the case Tayyabs, where the food was better than what I had in the US, the offerings here were in the opposite direction. Their clay pot rice, while tasting ok, didn't come in a clay pot and thus didn't have the unique texture and crunch on the bottom that its supposed to have. While the chow fun was on par which what I was used back home the won-ton soup lacked flavor and the duck over rice came covered in candy-sweet dark brown sauce, which I think was a nod to local tastes, since I had seen the exact same thing in Glasgow.

(The first was in a chinese cafe in Toronto but thats another story!)\n The waiter didnt write down the order, came back to check, repeated the order back to him, later came the dishes except for one, told him but not only did he give me mouth, we never even recieve the dish we ordered!! We didnt say anything after only because we didnt want to spend any more money in there. The teapot came with a streak of chilli oil on the lid, the portions werent big, food was greasy, the place was just dirty with food all over the floor. We didnt even dare to go to the toilet!\n When the bill came, the dish we ordered which we never got wasnt written down either...so clearly he wasnt listening and didnt care and gave me mouth about it! Needless to say, we did not give a tip, never going back even if it was cheaper than other places, the food was greasy I may as well had a kebab probably would have been cheaper and tastier! Next time we will find a chinese restaurant outside of chinatown."

Well, now, I think most people think of this place as 'where can I get a good portion of Chinese food at a good price?' - well, this is the place.\n First tip upon entering is to ignore the waiters on the ground level trying to get you seated straight away on this level - they only do this so the tourists outside will see a busy restaurant and think it must be popular. I would continue walking passed them explaining you have friends upstairs waiting - as the nicest tables and environment are upstairs. My experiences of unfortunately being seated on the ground level is noise, bustle, flies (in the summer) and drafts.\n The food is plentiful, and usually tastes very good. My personal favourite is the Sweet&Sour Chicken with Rice. But the cheap Jasmin tea isn't something to savor, so I'd skip it for a beer or coke.\n We often bring groups of friends here for dinner, so much so that 'Mr Man' (the manager, I am told) often throws in a free extra dish :-)"

They can have you in, fed and out in under half hour but the experience is not to be missed.\nThere are a lot of horror stories about how food the service can be but it's more clinically efficient than out and out rude. You are told where to sit, you might be sat with a stranger, there is little banter with the waiting staff but the quick turnover, the meeting with strangers and the cheap, quality food make for a great experience. Enjoy."

    "review": "If like me you believe that eating should be a question of taking on fuel rather than some kind of quasi-religious social event then the Wonky in Soho is the place for you. The minute you're in the door you're basically grabbed by the scruff of the neck and shoved down at a table, often one that's already occupied by some Chinese person loudly slurping down noodles. A demand is made for what you want and a pot of Chinese tea is banged down in front of you, followed seemingly just seconds later by the dish of your choice. In my case this is usually lemon chicken and boiled rice: mm lovely! The place being something of an institution you can buy a Wong Kei t-shirt just like the waiters wear. Some say the waiters are rude here. A diner in Soho (possibly here) once had a request for a second cup of coffee answered with a barked: No: you pay, you go!. But to me they aren't rude, they're efficient. And I wear my t-shirt with pride. Be warned the place don't take credit cards though, so take some cash and spare yourself an embarrassing mid-meal trip to the cash point. And don't even think about using the toilets. Apart from that, absolutely great."

The food is fantastic and you really do get a lot for one dish so really great value for money.\nYou can spend about 5-10 pounds and be full.\nI really liked the crispy duck, and they have some mean soups.\nThey provide you with a tasty tea while you wait and the service is sometimes quick sometimes a bit slow but it really depends on how busy it is.\n The selection of beer is not too vast but you are here for Chinese food not for the alcohol so that isn't too much of a bad thing. Inside is usualy quite packed but there is a great atmosphere in the resturaunt.\nSo overall probably one of the best Chinese resturaunts I have been to."

I got Singapore fried noodle. I was soo pleasedI felt like a veteran coming home.\nI have not been there for 5 years or so and I am hoping that the numbers have come back in the meantime. As for the service it used to be:\nOne? you sit here (ground floor)\ntwo? go downstair (basement)\nother numbers upstair (any of the other floors)\nglass table tops so the plates would slide across, generous portions and excellent prices.\nStrangley enough, the Lido around the corner had exactly the same menu, but at about 25% higher prices.

    "review": "Wonkey Wong Kei undoubtedly has a reputation for itself, whether it be good or bad, it's definitely a 'known suspect' in Chinatown. I've been here by myself loads of times, but I can't remember what food I ordered, or whether or not the food I did order was any good. The reason being, is that each and every time I've visited this canteen, some sort of commotion has taken place, which completely diverted my attention away from the food. And when I say commotion, boy do I mean COMMOTION.There are two notable occasions that stick in my mind. The first was this one time when I popped in on a beautiful summer's day, for a quick bite to eat. For those of you who haven't been there before, the downstairs street level is for single diners only. Groups of more than two, are seated upstairs in the sections that look more restauranty (carpet and wallpaper etc). But downstairs looks like a prison diner, a mess hall, a state school canteen kind of thing.So I was just sitting there, amongst an eclectic mix of diners (cabbies, minicabbies, students, oriental residents, workers from the nearby brothels, and this old aristocratic-like English lady who looked like miss Marple), when I heard a disturbance brewing at one of the neighbouring tables. There was some bickering going on between a customer and a waiter. So I turned to see what was going on. The customer was like a cockney type character, of slim build, in his 40's, about 5'9 with a demure 'The Sun' reader disposition about him. He may have been a cabbie. The waiter was a chubby, well-built stocky chap, in his twenties, who had short spikey hair and I think he was wearing glasses. So as I turned to figure out what all the fuss was about, I realized that it was regarding the dish that the customer had just received at his table. He started off in a friendly I didn't order this one, mate tone of voice, and the waiter contested with a firm yes you did kind of reply. It was a classic yes you did, no I didn't scenario, with each repetition increasing by a few decibels a pop, heading towards an almighty gut-wrenching crescendo. The cabbie character was adamant that he didn't order that dish. The dish in question was a 'duck fried rice'. Eventually, the waiter lost his cool, leaning over the customer, and with one sweeping karate chop hand gesture, sliced the air vertically down, right in front of the cabbie, and bellowed into his face, an ear splittingly coarse YOU ORDERED DUCK FLIED LICE!!!!!!!!!. Needless to say the whole restaurant went silent and turned to see the action. Miss marple started shaking her head in disapproval and I joined in with her, commenting on how rude I thought the waiter was, and how unnecessary his behaviour was. The poor cabby bloke was quaking in his boots, filled with fright, and shock, taken completely by surprise by the sheer audacity of this waiter's reaction. He just sat there cowering under the still airborne karate chop hand, which was still hovering around the poor guys face. Eventually, he came to his senses and managed to muster a bit of courage, replying to the waiter I don't need this s&%&! I'm not paying for it. I know what I ordered, and it weren't 'duck fried rice'!. And with that he stood up, still trembling from the combination of fright and embarrassment, and half heartedly managed to force a cocky swagger towards the front doors of the restaurant, turning around intermittently to issue a couple of 'f&$\u00a3 yous' to the waiter that had just ruined his day. How vulgar miss Marple said to me, as we both sat there in complete and utter disbelief.So that was one fond memory of Wong Kei. The second one I have of that place, is even more bizarre. It was one early evening, sort of like dinnerish time, when I was just passing by and couldn't help but pop in for a quick munch. So as usual I took position in the singles department, when I noticed a couple of giddy girls come in asking for a table for two. They were in their early twenties, sort of Essex secretary type girls, obviously having a little bit of a night out on the tiles. They seemed a little hammered. So they disappeared upstairs, and before I had time to place another mouthful of food into my mouth, another couple arrived, asking for the same deal. This time it was a couple of lads, both in their early twenties, basically the male version of what had just preceded them a few seconds ago. Two lads out on a bender. They too were ushered upstairs somewhere in the restaurant area. Then out of the blue, like say about ten minutes later or so, they all came flying down the chute, like human-laundry, one after the other, catapulted right out into the middle of the mess hall, all intertwined in some sort of brawl. They were fighting each other. It was the two lads vs the two ladies, if that's at all possible. There was screaming and shouting, ranting and raging, bodies flying here and there; it took me a while to figure out what the hell was going on. Basically, one of the lads was"

The food is good and plentiful and complimentary jasmine tea is given (tip: when you want a refil leave the pot lid open and it will be efficiently re-filled). The drinks list is limited but reasonable priced. I've been going here for years and the service doesn't really change... it's quick and efficient but don't expect pleasantries. You don't get a choice of where you sit (either which level or table). Mostly you end up sharing one of the large circular tables with other diners. Taking this into account I have never had a bad experience here and it all adds up to a quirky dining experience. The decor is basic but varies from floor to floor, I think the best room is the first floor by the window if you are lucky enough to be told to go there !"

Rock n' Roll music and communal tables. We got seated at a couple of bar seats looking out the window. The menu was easy to read and we both opted for two ramens, a chicken kaarage appetizer and I ordered an Asahi Beer.\nAbout 10-15 minutes later, other folks that arrived after us started getting food, and we had not even received our beer or water. So after telling the staff, we got our drinks 3-5 minutes later. Then the food arrived and I had specifically asked if there was bean sprouts. He wasn't sure, so I said, okay, if there is, please put it on the side. \nGuess what I got in my ramen when it arrived? That's right, bean sprouts.  The food itself wasn't bad. Decent broth, plenty of noodles and meat. A bit too oily for my own taste, but oil in broth is individual preference.\nThen we wanted our check. I asked for it, and that alone took another 10 minutes. We waited and waited. I finally started to lose my patience and asked again, this time I told the waitress that we've had a pretty poor experience here. The manager came back with a fair discount and apologized for the experience. Apparently the original waiter was a trainee, which begs the question why wasn't he \"mentored\" by an experienced server. Anyways, the manager's response and sincerity saved this review from being a 1 star. I don't believe this is typical service, so I'd still recommend folks to try them out. Cheers!"

I went in solo and because of this I think I was sometimes forgotten as other tables were getting their food before mine. In the end... the result was that they actually forgot to put my order in the kitchen, however I was compensated with extra chashu meat in my ramen. \nThe ramen broth did the trick and was very warming while I slurped the broth and dipped my noodles in it. The charting on the meat was also perfect as it gave an unique taste to the meat. The eggs were also boiled to a perfect runny Golden State which is usually a pivotal point of the ramen for me.

Bone Daddies has this really hip vibe, you'd think it's a cool bar but it's just really awesome how they made Ramen look cool. First of all, I've not been to a Ramen place that offers you bibs and hair ties (for ladies with long locks). That's really thoughtful. \nThe area is smaller than most restaurants. There's usually a queue outside, but the wait is about 15-20mins depending how crowded it is. Its a little noisy, so it's probably not great for intimate conversations. The place is cramp, so you'll find yourself squeezed between people. It's generally not a place to bring babies or kids. Absolutely great for couples and if you're lucky, you might get an entire table for larger groups. \nI usually order the T22 Ramen with Chicken scratchings. It's probably one of my favourite. If you're not into pork all that much, there's that option for you. There are a bunch of vegetarian options as well. So you'll be glad to find a variety. Today however we decided to try something else on the menu:\n1. Tonkotsu Ramen \u00a311: Pork belly with Spring onions in 20 hours cooked pork broth\n- If you're looking for an easy entrance and introduction to classic Ramen, this would be a good choice. It comes with two flavoured eggs and Bamboo shoots. I usually put in extra garlic and sesame crushed seeds to bump up the flavour. \n2. Curry Ramen \u00a312: Spicy curry broth with deep fried chicken and jalape\u00f1o\n- Anyone who likes chilli should try this bowl of fire. It tastes as spicy as it looks. Be prepared to have a cup of ice water ready. Also don't be surprise if you suffer the \"ring of fire\" the next day \nAs with all good restaurants in London, there is usually a wait. But it's shaded and there's a heater outside. They work very quickly to try serve everyone their food. I've never been disappointed with their services and would definitely continue to come here."

Whereas in a real ramen place, you are expected to eat and leave straight away.  The queue here used to be really long and I remembered queuing just to get in here.  \nThe noodle here is not up to my liking.  They are probably the thicker and they cooked it for too long so they are not springy enough.  The broth here is also diluted with no depth of flavour.

Condiments all looked to be in the standard style, the hair bands were an odd addition, but back in the rock hair phase they may have been useful!\nI ordered:\nPork Bone ramen. Korean wings. Green tea and still water. \nThe wings showed up quickly. They were well spiced and as sticky as you like. Not too small, just right for an appetiser I reckon. Between two as a light one maybe.\nThe main event arrived shortly after. \nThe broth was great. Tasty and lightly spiced as expected. I added a little of the chilli and I was more than happy with its heat level. The pork was a little thicker than I would have expected, but that isn't a bad thing. Lots of top ramen content. \nMy green tea never arrived but my server was more than happy to either bring it to me or remove it from the bill.\nOverall I enjoyed it, I'll certainly be back. It's not Shoryu good, but it's really close."

    "review": "The rock -n- roll of ramen. If you want a hip spot that satisfies your craving for warm noodles, Bone Daddies is your cool friend. There is a good variety of ramen, from the spicy to more traditional, even curry and vegetarian options. It's also open late.\nOne thing I wasn't expecting was the amazing Brussel sprouts - yes Brussel sprouts! - side dish that was packed with fried green goodness, citrus and pomegranates. It's so much better than your generic edamame and sets them apart from many other ramen joints.\nGet ready for a burst of flavour as the broth is quite thick, and their tonkatsu comes with a black garlic sesame oil which can be quite overpowering if you are looking for something more subtle. However if you are in the mood to rock, you will take comfort in this wild take on a Japanese classic."

They advertise their tonkatsu as 20 hour pork bone broth that is \"A Bone Daddies Favorite: creamy white broth with Braised Tractor pork.\"\nThe first time I  ordered tonkatsu, I got a brown insta-broth, I thought it was a mistake. I ordered it again, and it was brown again, and didn't have the tonkatsu taste.  It was oily and tasted like they just threw a pack of soup into hot water and grease, almost like a bad roux. I called them to ask if their tonkatsu was brown, and they confirmed, saying \"That's how we make it.\" I've seen other reviews with the creamy white broth, so I don't know if they just send people who order delivery anything or what.\nIt's actually decent if you're craving ramen, but not the taste I was looking for. The minced pork is really good, and their chashu is delicious.  The noodles aren't my favorite. They seem to be soba noodles (buckwheat), but don't retain any of the flavors."

They were good but it already started with the presentation. I couldn't see any love there. Even a ramen for 5 bucks in Tokyo sometimes had a better presentation than the bowl I had in front of me. As for the taste I had to say it was a tad to bitter for me. But that is just my own preference. I think the quality was ok and the meat was very tender. The egg was amazing!!\nYou also can add fresh garlic and a chili paste to your ramen. Top!\nSERVICE\nI think the staff were nice and attentive. Only can say good things about them and all of them look pretty cool. \nATMOSPHERE\nWell it is different from a japanese style ramen restaurant. I would describe it as hip or alternative which is also reflected by the staff working there and I absolutely love it.

    "review": "How, HOW does Bone Daddies have such high ratings? Due to the number of great reviews this ramen joint has I decided to check it out for myself and I've only left in utter disappointment.  I tried the tonkotsu ramen during my first visit and the broth was pure NaCl.  It was so salty I couldn't finish my ramen which, trust me, has never happened before.  The soup here is honestly what I'd imagine the Dead Sea tastes like. Tonkotsu broth is often a creamy pale color but here it looks more like shoyu broth, perhaps they add a tub of soy sauce to it, rendering it completely inedible.  Besides the salt factor, it also doesn't have a nice pork flavor that is characteristic of quality tonkotsu ramen.  Lastly, I usually love nitamago which are seasoned soft boiled eggs but again here they're overly salty and not enjoyable.  They really need to tone it down a bit.\nI thought my first experience was a fluke so I came back again to give Bone Daddies a chance to prove me wrong. This time I tried their tan tan men which was yet another letdown.  The broth left a powdery aftertaste and the noodles were beyond soggy.  \nI hate to say this, but Bone Daddies is probably some of the worst ramen I've ever had.  Don't come here if you want anything remotely tasty or authentic.  Try Shoryu, Ippudo, or Kanada-ya instead if you're looking for something better in London."

I still have a slight preference for Ippudo but Bone daddies is a close second plus it had more interesting choices in ramen combination.\nWe started with snacks: chicken wings which were simply yummy the right amount of sweet and spicy with a bit of a crunch.\nChashu pork and corn croquettes are abs fab a must order!!!! \nNow onto the ramen:\nMy friend went for the Prince of darkness. They warn you the it is f***ing spicy and it is. It s the kind of spice that creeps up on you (meaning its progressive) \nI went for the IP tonkotsu with an egg and it was just greatly balanced. The 20hours pork broth is just perfect but for me the noodles were a bit too large and too cooked but that s a personal choice. I like my ramen thin and al dente. Other than that the whole was just delish \nfor the drinks we had the asahi cream head and the watermelon crush. Beer is beer obs but the watermelon crush was just the right amount of sourness and freshness I loved it, it goes perfectly with my dish as it was a little bit spicy so they married well.\nOverall there is no doubt Bone daddies is one of the best places to get ramen in London!!!!"

The service is quick and the food came out very quickly. My choice to order was easy as there is 1 vegetarian ramen on the menu. \nThe ramen noodles were chewy but the thin kind that tend to get soggy quickly so slurp quickly! The vegetarian mushroom broth was pretty average. The flavour was one-dimensional and it was just a strong umami taste. No spice or creaminess that I've had in other vegetarian ramens. The toppings are perfectly cooked and the eggs yolks were golden and runny which was perfect. \nThe overall experience was great and I understand why there was a long line-up of people waiting in the rain on a Monday night to get in. Didn't hit the spot on my ramen craving but I would recommend to non-vegetarians!"

That said, I can say that this place is hit-or-miss. Some dishes are amazing and some are just bland. For example, I ordered the kimchee ramen while the others ordered the tonkatsu ramen. My ramen was bursting with flavor and good, but the tonkatsu was the opposite. The people in my group complained that it was one of the worst that they had ever tried. There was no seasoning at all. They had to add soy sauce or black oil to spice it up a bit. Disappointing. With the appetizers, order the fried chicken and skip the pork and corn croquettes. Again, one was perfect while the other one needed more. \nThe restaurant is located close to Chinatown and I would have totally missed it if I walked by. The place is small so be prepared for a wait during meal times. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They had us come in from the rain and sit on stools until there was a table available. \nRemember that compared to almost every other currency in the world, the London pound is pretty expensive so don't expect this place to be cheap."

I wanted to like this more, but I didn't care too much for the ramen here. I liked Ippudo and Kanada-Ya better.\nThis place didn't feel as authentically Japanese as Kanada-Ya did, and more of a fusion, cheeky-humor kind of place. I felt like I could be in a small ramen shop in Japan when I was at Kanada-Ya, but felt like I could be in SF or NY when I was inside Bone Daddies. This place is much more amenable for larger groups than Kanada-Ya. If you have more than 2 people, Kanada-Ya may not be a good fit, but I think Bone Daddies would be able to accommodate parties of 4-6, but not much larger. The wait is probably much shorter too.\nI ordered the Tantanmen which has sesame, chili, minced pork, chashu pork and bok choy. The broth was rich and flavorful, but I preferred the broth at Ippudo NY and Kanada-Ya better. The pork here was a bit on the dry side which was disappointing - it needed a bit more fat in it. Normally, I have no problem polishing off a bowl of ramen, but I didn't finish this one. Noodles were fine, but I preferred the chewier / more al-dente noodles at Katana-Ya.\nKorean Fried Chicken Wings - These were huge, and had almost too much sauce on them. I didn't find them really crispy on the outside, probably because there was too much sauce on them. I don't think I'd get these again.\nIf you're looking for ramen and want more options on flavors and more unique combinations / fusion, then this place is great. It's also good for slightly larger groups and/or if you want to have drinks with your meal. If you want a more authentic ramen experience, head over to Katana-Ya."

It's more of a ramen bar than a nice sit down place. Very loud and lively, the locals seem to love it.\nThe staff were not that friendly imo. It wasn't very clear that we were supposed to wait by the wall once entering. We thought we had a spot already because it looked like they were gesturing us to follow the group in front of us. That was awkward. While seated, the waitress ran into my bf while walking through the aisle and didn't even say sorry, just asked him to tuck in his chair when it wasn't even his fault. No smiles given. It's definitely a little crammed in there. \nAnyways, the food. We didn't get any apps or drinks, just the tonkotsu and T22 ramen. The food came reasonably quick, around 10-15min wait. Tonkotsu had very standard ramen broth, on par with Ippudo in NYC. I thought I'd try the T22 because I don't have chicken ramen very often. It was delicious - and there are cock scratchings which added crunch. The broth got a bit salty after awhile though. They use thin noodles which I loved.

The interior has Japanese inspired graphics, and pictures of Japanese rockers plastered all over the walls. Diners are seated on stools at high tables. The rest of the Bone Daddies experience comes courtesy of an all-out onslaught on the senses, the noise, the smells, the tastes - fantastic.\nTo start, we ordered the Salmon Tartar, Wild Soft Shell Crab, and Edamame. I regret not ordering the Korean Fried Chicken Wings which, the couple sharing our high-table so thoroughly seemed to have enjoyed. Our salmon, which is served with a lime wasabi ponzu, was really good; the salmon so fresh I could swear it had a pulse. The soft-shelled crabs come with an out-of-this-world Thai green curry, chilli and ginger sauce - OMG!\nFor our mains, we ordered the oddly named T22, which is a soy ramen, a Kimchee Ramen and my favourite, Spicy Miso Ramen - all amazing; my spicy miso ramen as good as any I have had in Tokyo (and believe me I have had a lot). The noodles are not just genuine ramen noodles but they were cooked perfectly.\nService is good for London, and it's fast; they're just too busy to be friendly.

I got the classic Tonkotsu Ramen, and didn't enjoy it enough to finish (and trust me - I eat a LOT).  The broth was nice and thick, but lacked flavor, and the texture of the noodle wasn't as chewy as I would have liked.\nThey did have this awesome brussel sprout appetizer though - the pomegranate seeds added a great kick to it, so an extra star for that!  I would go if you're looking for a quick meal but nothing worth going out of your way for."

    "review": "Fantastic ramen. I'm far from the first person to figure out Bone Daddies knows what's up, but I've now been twice, and each time I've been impressed. I decided to try to curry ramen with fried chicken - amazing. They had some appetizers that looked delicious as well, but with a big bowl of ramen, your stomach will be full, so one course is really all you need, unless you have a few people to share something with. \nWe got there at 7:30pm (on a Monday) and probably waited 15 minutes to get seated. Once in our seats, we didn't have to wait long to order though, and the food came pretty promptly. I'm excited to try some other ramen places in London, but Bone Daddies did a pretty good job of setting the bar. We'll see if anything else comes close."

    "review": "Bone Daddies is definitely a great ramen place to check out in London. Went with two other friends and we ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, Kimchee Ramen, & Dipping Ramen to share among us three.\n1. Tonkotsu Ramen was on the saltier side. Definitely good, but nothing particularly outstanding in terms of how tonkotsu ramen broth. The noodles were a very good level of not too hard and not too soft. I definitely enjoyed the noodles, and was a bit let down with the broth. It was simply just salty and nothing particularly flavorful. Nevertheless, it was wonderful with a cup of water on the side.\n2. Kimchee Ramen was super spicy. You need a strong ability to handle spiciness to take on this broth. It came with a lot of seafood which was wonderful and very fresh. As someone who personally cannot handle anything too spicy, this was definitely something not in my zone of comfort. However, my friends who love anything super spicy were really happy with the flavor of the broth.\n3. Dipping Ramen was a very unique experience where all the ramen ingredients came on a platter next to a cup of sauce. The sauce appeared clear but was extremely flavorful. I personally really enjoyed this dish because it was not only a unique ramen experience, but also something well-flavored and worth the price!\nADVICE: Arrive at an early dinnertime! There will be a line! The line will most likely be outdoors so bring a nice coat to wear. There will be hooks on the wall inside of the restaurant, so you can hang up your coat when you're seated."

But messy, soooo messy! \nWe both had the tonkatsu ramen with the now famous pork bone broth. Rich, creamy and flavoursome, loaded with noodles, spring onion and a perfectly soft poached egg- ramen perfection! I did add a load of chilli to mine, so think next time I'll order the spicy version and see how I get on!\nWe ended our meal with a selection of moochi ice creams. The green tea was good but slightly bitter, the raspberry fresh and fruity and the chocolate has a rich, mousse like quality to it. \nStaff were friendly and the atmosphere was buzzing - yet another great spot in soho!"

I liked the sound of this place as it was casual dining and has received great reviews. \nAt 4pm, it was not very busy so my husband and I decided to take the seats near the window gazing out on to the street. I was glad we had the room around our seats as it created a little privacy . The only downside to this was having to turn around to talk to the server, but that was no big deal. \nI liked so many things; the little jar of elastic hair bands, bibs, fresh ginger with press, the music and most of all, that there's no shame in slurping.\nWe had the fried chicken, which was served piping hot. It came with a lemon wedge, but we preferred a dipping sauce and found the soy sauce, which was good. I then had the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra egg, corn and chicken cock scratchings. Now I was unsure about the latter, but the waitress explained it's a nice crunchy garnish, which it certainly was. After my meal, I was nicely full and glad it wasn't raining as I totally needed to walk off the ramen.  I can't wait to go back to try the other dishes."

You can't read the menu if you are seated in the corner. From a distance, I thought the place was closed.\nI ordered the IP Tonkatsu ramen. It came looking nice but I notice black spots on the ramen , as soon as I stirred, it turned the whole broth deep brown. This was not the color of ramen that I wanted nor is expected. It should be a creamy oily white broth.\nAfter a few bites, I couldn't eat anymore. It tasted overwhelmingly like soy sauce. There are soy flavor ramens but this was just too strong of soy sauce. \nI thought ok, let me order another ramen and maybe it was just a one off. I showed a picture of what I wanted and they said it was spicy miso.\nThe spicy miso appeared nothing like the photo I pointed to the waitress. All the ingredients were the same yes but again the color of the broth was wrong. It was a pale red dull color. The taste was better than the tonkatsu but still not what I wanted.\nI basically ordered two ramens, ate half of one and paid \u00a330. Oh guess what, they also tack on service charge 12% and force you to donate \u00a31 to charity in your bill.\nThe worst experience I've had in London so far. \nThe two stars is for the fact that the ingredients themselves were very good. The noodles were not typical ramen firmness or cut but were still very delectable. The corn is from a grilled cob and sliced off in small stacks. The egg is soft boiled but might have had too much soy flavor or that was due to my broth I'm not sure.\nThe service in general was nice but they should have known better or tried to accommodate me in some way when they knew I didn't like any ramen even after ordering two. I'm not asking for free food but it would have been nice if they at least asked if I enjoyed the food after I said I didn't enjoy the first ramen. I think that means they don't genuinely care and just want your money.\nWatch out."

Tonk...whatever) ramen, and added the cock scratching because in all the pictures I saw of ramen from Bone Daddies I could spot these crispy bits on top and really wanted to know what they were and try them. \nOH. MY. SWEET. BABY. DAY. IN. THE. LIFE. \nCan I just go back there RIGHT NOW?\nThe 20h pork broth was so rich and creamy, it would have been delicious on its own. Like, even without the perfectly sliced thin pork, the flavourful noodles, the hard-boiled eggs that kept a soft but not runny yolk, the soy sauce on the one side of the bowl, the spring onions, and all the other bits, including the scratching. Which were out of this world delicious. \nI would love to say something more about the place itself, the hairband and bib they provide for mess-free experience, the atmosphere, etc. But I have a parade of ramen soups dancing in front of my eyes and can't think of anything else but going back there asap. \nSo if you're anything like me (i.e. a fussy introverted mess) you'll want to run away when you see the crowd, PLEASE BE PATIENT BECAUSE IT'S WORTH IT.

The place gives off very hipster vibes.\nI actually really enjoyed their Salmon Tartar with the Lime Wasabi Ponzu and it came with Renkon Chips! The salmon was definitely fresh and the ponzu was amazing with the salmon, it's bright, citrusy, and a nice kick of wasabi! Actually one of the best things I've had! I really liked what they did with the sauce for the salmon. \nI had the Tonkotsu Ramen and it was okay. It definitely is one of the better ramen places that I've visited in London, but the ramen itself was still a little lackluster in general. The broth was fine, it's actually a little less salty than other places which I liked. The broth is also very creamy. The ramen egg was really nice, but the menma (bamboo shoots) were quite awful...lots of unchewable strands of bamboo shoots! There were hard and hay like strands in my bamboo shoots and toppings. The noodles were quite bad though, it was mushy for me. Perhaps it was just that night or my ramen had been sitting out for a while, because ramen noodles should never be mushy! Mine had no bounce whatsoever (it was also quite thin), very limp, and it was just overall unpleasant to eat in general. Not quite consistent with what I've heard about their ramen, but that was what I had. LIMP NOODLE!!!\nI had the Gini Hendrix cocktail as well and I highly recommend the drink! It's like a Gin and Tonic but much more refreshing and bright! Love the addition of cucumbers and yuzu liquor instead of tonic, so refreshing and much more complex. Oolong syrup didn't really add a tea taste to it, but it was a very sweet drink. Probably my favourite cocktail ever!\nIt's a great place to meet up with others and have a decent meal, but it is actually quite dark inside. Prices are also pretty steep for food."

But as far as Japanese food goes in particular, I'm a snob and very much an isolationist. I want my dishes simple and authentic. Not a huge fusion fan either. And I want my tastebuds to feel the sensation of being transported to the land of the rising sun. \nWith that disclaimer out there, if you want an original experience, sure, hit up Bone Daddies. But if you want an authentic experience, you won't get that here. This is big-time, hipster noodle fare.\n- The noodles are frozen. You can't customize the consistency and they cook them pretty soft here (firm should be the standard). They're also crimpy to the max. T_T\n- They don't serve rice. At all. No rice. Zero.\n- Tea is from a packet.\n- They don't have togarashi. Seriously? \n- No vinegar either.\n- The broths are not so much flavorful as they are intensely spicy. If spicy broth is your thing, then by all means, jet on over here for some indulgence. But I prefer rich and full broths.\nThe milky / creamy broth in the tantanmen was very interesting. I've never had it like this before. Or with peanuts. Or with chashu. But with very little ground meat in the first place. Hmmm. I ordered it without the extra chilies and it still had a crazy bite to it. The tantanmen 2 is even moreso, veryvery spicy.\nI'll end this on some positives. \n+ Their karaage is good as far as fried chicken goes, but no need to go crazy for it, guys. \n+ Kudos on offering black sesame and kinako flavours for dessert, but those dishes were too diluted for one to truly appreciate such unique tastes. Less subtle, more concentrated, please.\n+ Fresh garlic!\n+ Their bamboo had a good crunch and their eggs are cooked perfectly.\n+ Hilarious bibs on request, haha."

Quite tasty; the broth is a bit too thick for my taste but some people may prefer it. Noodles were ok, a bit skimpy on the meat but satisfying overall. Chili sauce was more Chinese style than Japanese. It was fine but a bit of an ecclectic mix if you're expecting a Japanese ramen shop. Soft shell crab apps was very tasty & fresh; though the accompanying dipping sauce was quite odd & not a really good pairing. Agedashi tofu was quite disappointing. \nMay return but probably will try the chicken broth ramen instead and the chicken wings app (they look quite appetizing)."

The ramen is in a very rich chicken bone broth. The broth had a padron pepper floating in it, and complimented the pork neck chasu. I've had my fair share of ramen and I really loved this ramen. I found that although it was spicy (just the way I like it), the broth was just a teensy bit sweet. Not sure if that was due to the Miso? This did not bother me though.

I absolutely love ramen, and though I've spent a few months in Japan eating tons of it,  I'm no snob. I've slurped my fair share of 89cent pre-packaged block ramen and know that hey-- there's a spectrum. \nFrom what I'd read from others regarding ramen in London,  they don't really come close to the authentic fare,  but are still incredibly delicious. So when I saw that bone daddies was super hyped here and other places online,  I was actually really excited (despite the overwhelmingly hipster vibes). In the end,  I left disappointed. \nI had the tonkotsu ramen, hyped for a punch of that 20 hour deep, rich porky flavor, but instead I got an over salty (and trust me,  I loves me some salt) bowl of mediocrity. I can't speak for any of the other dishes,  but really... Even the crazy blaring music wasn't enough to distract me from how lacking in any depth of flavor this was. Like some basic stock and noodles. It was nothing special, so for the price, I didn't feel I'd gotten my money's worth. I've still yet to try some of the other recommended ramen places in London,  but as of now,  I definitely opulent rush back to bone daddies. \nTwo stars because the egg was perfectly cooked,  edamame delicious,  and asahi flowin'."

Also, I do prefer to not eat meat when I can, but the only broth they had was mushroom, which I'm allergic to, so it would be nice if they could get more vegetable broths.

Was quite promising when we came in, but.... The food was average... Bummer. As a general measure when I get ramen, I always try the tonkotsu... If the place can make a good flavoursome clean tonkotsu then it's gotta be a bangin' place... Sadly the only thing good about this tonkotsu were the thin yellow noodles.. The broth was way too fatty and 'creamy' in a not so nice way as the flavour lacked depth and seasoning. You have some egg in there and a couple of slices thin pork. For the price you pay and the lack of real tonkotsu flavoured broth you're better off going to a Shoryu chain or even Wagamamas and that's saying something 'cos they're average too. The food also came out super fast which was a little concerning. Service was inconsistent depending on staff. Hmm... I feel bad to give them a dull review but...

Let's settle with three because the service was really something special.\nI think part of the problem I am going to have with all ramen shops in London is that none of them are going to match the ramen I ate in Tokyo a handful of months ago. It's just not going to happen. Plus, diners are waaaaaaayyyyyyy too politically correct with how they eat a bowl of Ramen in England. Please, people, just shove your head into the bowl and slurp those noodles up into your mouth. \nMy husband and I started off on a good foot. We popped in at prime dinner time and were seated straightaway at the bar in front of the windows. I liked the curtains hung on the entance, very Japanese. I ordered a Berry Berry Somethingorother which was made of gin and had a fresh raspberry in it but I wasn't wowed by it. I mean, it was OK but nothing special. I was more wowed by the fact that such a fancy cocktail was served to me in what is considered a fast food shop in Japan.\nOn the table was:\n-a bottle of fresh garlic cloves and a garlic press\n-chopsticks, napkins and bibs (happy I brought my own fork, BYOF)\n-a bottle of hair ties (yes, like to tie your hair back into a ponytail)\n-various sauces like soy and some chili-based looking sauce\nWe ordered the fried chicken, the T22 and a second kind of ramen which fails to come to memory at present. The fried chicken came in a little stainless steel bucket and looked a bit like popcorn chicken but larger pieces. Some of the pieces had been sitting underneath the heating lap for an extended period of time because they were cold and chewy. Other pieces were hot as though they just came out of the fryer. I remember commenting, \"I'd rather have wasted these calories at KFC).\" So, there's that.\nMy ramen, the T22, was not super great or even great. Now that I think about it, it wasn't even that good. I highly disliked the crackling. The noodles looked like they came out of a packet. The chicken was sparse. And, in general, it just was not my cuppa ramen. Also, as an added bonus, I started burping up the broth about 30 minutes after eating.\nPerhaps it my ramen selection that literally left a bitter taste in my mouth or perhaps Bone Daddies just doesn't have as great of ramen as claimed. Either way, there are too many other ramen shops in London to try before returning to Bone Daddies."

The right amount of spring onion, bean sprout, crispy garlic slices, bamboo shoots, and a little picked ginger right in the middle. Perfect eggs, perfect slices of pork. Topped off by a little house chili oil sauce, and wow. I ate the whole bowl and would have licked it if I could have fit my face inside. \nJust noticed I used the word \"perfect\" three times! So it's just not getting that fifth star because I think \u00a311 is a bit much, and a pint of Asahi for \u00a34.5 is a bit steep too. A beer and a bowl of (admittedly totally delicious) ramen coming out to \u00a316? I happily paid, but secretly wished was more like \u00a312 (\u00a39 for the ramen, \u00a33 for the beer) - then it'd get 5 stars. Perhaps I trifle. \nAnyway, as I said, nom."

The broccoli were nicely cooked but none of us liked the sauce served with it. We didn't think it's taste went well with broccoli. Instead we ate them with soy sauce.

While the broth was okay, I thought it could have used more flavor, and I thought the noodles themselves were pretty basic. The pork, however, was great!\nI think what it comes down to is this: Bone Daddies is more of a trendy, hipster spot than an authentic ramen joint.

They should definitely open another branch - one of this is just too little of goodness.\nCrammy inside, so don't expect fine dining, but then again - it's soul food! So, come in, enjoy, slurp as loud as you can (that shows your appreciation for the chef if they did a good job) and LEAVE.

We ordered soft shell crab and a pork/corn croquette. After 20 minutes I complained, I said where is my food? My lunch hour ends in 20 minutes! Waiter went away and then started serving other people.\nAt this point the starters got delivered. Flagged down another waitress and said I wanted to complain that the 3 different groups who arrived behind us got their STARTERS AND MAIN delivered before us. She explained our starters were fried so it takes longer.\nWhat? Frying food take longer than regular food?\nRamen came with the original waiter. He explained because there was a big group and because it was fried it took longer. I said well then you should have told me frying food takes longer and I would've just told you to bring me the ramen first! He said he didn't know we were in a rush. Mate, I came here before, I didn't need to explain I was in a rush, the food arrived at decent intervals!!!!\nI was speechless. It's lunch hour in the middle of Soho which is pretty much surrounded by working types yes? We are not in the suburbs here! I was too shocked to speak and my face must have given away a million words. He explained the croquettes were on the house. \nPAH.\nBecause of this farce the food tasted horrible and tasteless to me. I was in no mood to enjoy any of this. We had about 7 minutes to chow down the ramen and pay and leave. I was late back to work anyway.\nI'm not coming back. Don't do lunch hour if you can't handle it. \nI actually just remembered the same thing happened to me at Flesh n Buns during lunch. My colleague and I ordered 4 starters and 2 mains. After 20 minutes we chased and 2 starters came. After 20 more minutes the other 2 starters came. We had 10 minutes to make main course and run back to the office. They didn't have a takaway licence. We ended up paying for 4 starters and eating instant noodles at the office. The place was empty mind you, it's not like they had a full house to cook lunch for.\nDEFINITELY do not come here if you don't have more than an hour spare."

I went for lunch with my mum and my sister (a quick lunch mind as it was a workday) and our total bill was over \u00a350.\nThat said, it is damn good ramen, having tried Shoryu and Tonkotsu, it is, in my opinion, the winner in the area. Get there early, there aren't reservations and it's all communal seating. If you're a big party you might even lose your place in the queue as smaller groups are seated where they can fit.\nMy sister loved the fact that they had a) plastic bibs, and b) a little bottle of hairbands for tying back your hair so you didn't eat it while you slurped your noodles. And you want to slurp your noodles. Ramen arrived quickly along with a single order of croquettes and we went to town. If your noodles don't come with an egg, order the egg as an extra, it's worth it. 2 Tonkotsu and a Tantanmen were ordered on this day and the bowls went down a treat.\nGet there early, sit and enjoy your noodles and then make way for the next customer. A long drawn out meal this isn't!\nI'm going to um and ah about this one for a while but yes, for now, Bone Daddies your are a solid 4 out of 5. Who knows, I might upgrade it later."

I initially thought there was not quite enough broth for that number of noodles, but actually it was all so rich that I found it difficult to finish it all.\n- Soup = Gorgeous...now I want to try all the other flavours\n- Eggs = Cooked to perfection with squidgy middles and well-seasoned\n- Meat = Fatty, full of flavour and so tender that it falls apart on your chopsticks\n- Extras = It was good that you can add extra garlic...and I shared some of Rob's extra pipette of fat. Yum\n- Noodles = Perfect\nThe staff were complete sweeties and coped well with such a large group.\nThe only let-down for me was the karaage chicken...the taste was okay but it wasn't crunchy (maybe they made it in advance and reheated it???) \nThe drinks were also a bit pricey... over \u00a38 for ume-shu!? wha!?\nHowever these weren't big enough gripes to detract a star, so I think I have found my new favourite ramen shop."

We're big Koya fans but Bone Daddies is equally as good, if not quite as zen (and of course the menus are very different).\nWe had some delicious sake to keep us warm in the queue and then were ushered to some of the best seats in the house (near hooks for hanging coats! joy!) where we were swiftly served with drinks and our fantastic starters - soft shell crab and tenderstem broccoli with their respective sauces were absolutely top drawer. We were surprised to discover the sauce with the broccoli is made with a Japanese citrus fruit - it's hard to describe its unique flavour but that's not what we would have guessed. The fiery green pepper/jalapeno based accompaniment with the soft shell was also unusual and a great match.\nRamen was outstanding. I followed Yee Gan's lead and had the tantanmen - it's fiery kick caught the back of my throat more than once, which was awesome! My bff also loved his tonkutsu ramen, he drained the bowl in about 10 minutes.\nService as I said was swift but also friendly and enthusiastic with the staff despite how busy it was taking time to explain the sauces to us and not rushing us out despite me taking forever to eat my ramen (it really is filling!).\nFinally, at \u00a311 a bowl this is perfectly priced - for the quality of the food it's excellent value.\nExcited already for my next visit!"

For appetizers we had CHASHU PORK & CORN CROQUETTE which was a rather random choice but it was a very good pick and I highly recommend you to taste that: we were really surprised.

I am a big salmon sashimi fan and I think this was actually my favorite part of the meal:P\nI ordered the tantanmen 2 ramen with chicken broth, which was one of the only two options without pork on the menu. I found this a bit limiting, but I'm told that in the future they will have some beef broth options. My friend got the miso broth and enjoyed it a lot. We also admired the cute logo of the place and the interesting name (it fits so well! what a neat place!)\nWhen my tantanmen arrived I wasn't sure what to expect with my first real ramen, and my first impression was that it had quite a kick! The broth is spicy and much thicker and creamier than I expected. After a few sips I got used to the spice and enjoyed the intense flavour it gave the ramen noodles. I was skeptical about trying the eggs at first since I am not an egg person, but they looked so good sitting there with their melting yolks that I had to try it and am glad I did. They are as silky as everyone here is saying and the perfect ramen eggs. The noodles and chicken were good and the few random pieces of bamboo. I think for a first timer, I found the broth too rich and heavy to drink it all but I enjoyed the half of it I managed. \nThe service was friendly and very helpful. The place itself is probably hipster heaven with a long line of cold people waiting to get into a very busy and tiny place.

It was decent, but just a little drier for my tastes, and some of the cuts looked weird - not uniform chunks, so perhaps the thicker pieces came out juicier if they cooked at the same time? It came with some lemon, but due to some of the pieces being drier than others, I would have preferred a sauce, perhaps a tonkatsu sauce or something? The seasoning was good though.\nFor my main, the star of the show, I ordered a bowl of the tonkotsu ramen, which is my personal favorite style. Born in Hakata, tonkotsu ramen, or \"pork bone\" broth ramen is usually very rich and served with straight and thin noodles, since the broth sticks very well to the strands. It was absolutely perfect here, thick, rich, and absolutely perfectly seasoned. The broth had a nice layer of mayu black garlic oil at the top, and was topped with a nicely cooked marinated soft-boiled Clarence Court egg, scallion, bamboo, garlic chips, ginger, and bean sprouts.\nThe noodles were cooked perfectly, and the broth was absolutely perfect. I pressed a clove of garlic and put some ground sesame into the broth and quickly finished the noodles. I was still hungry, so I ordered a kaedama (extra noodles) and more bamboo. It came out very quickly (within 90 seconds), which is a great sign of a ramen kitchen, and I finished every drop of the broth.\nThe bowls are fairly priced here and they don't nickel-and-dime you for each additional topping like some places do, and the service was on point. I highly recommend this ramen joint to anyone who likes ramen in London, and I'll definitely be back here whenever I'm in London!"

    "review": "Summary: \n+Great soya ramen \n+Lighter broth compared to tonkotsu (pork) based ramen\n+There's usually a queue. So watch out. \n+Quirky atmosphere \nOverall:\nI went to one of my go-to noodle places in central London. Bone Daddies is one of the specialist ramen restaurants that opened in 2012 in the midst of what surely will be remembered in history as the First Ramen Rush. (I made that up.) This was a truly glorious time for ramen aficionados in which three specialist ramen restaurants opened one after another in central London in a period of less than 10 months. It is generally agreed in our enlightened circle that significance of this series of events matches that of other events that took place that year such as London Olympics, the phone hacking scandal or the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. OK, that was an overstatement. But it was a good year. \nAnyway. I arrived at the restaurant five minutes before their opening to have an early dinner. After a few minutes of waiting, a friendly waiter showed me to a counter seat by the large window that oversees the street. Across the street, I could see people cleaning large glass windows of what looked like a new juice bar that was about to open. I tried to remember what kind of shop was there before but I couldn't. I guess it didn't matter after all. If they had food, I would have remembered something. \nBy the time I ordered, there was already a few more groups in the restaurant. The restaurant calls itself a \"ramen bar\". Appropriately, the counter tables and high stools decorate the hip dining space along with quirky Japanese posters from the 1960s. \nFood: \nI ordered their signature dish, soya ramen. \nThe soup is based on clear chicken broth and soya sauce mix. The result is incredible richness without the excessive grease of pork-based broth. The soya sauce and slightly burnt green onion adds a hint of bitterness and flavour to the broth. \nThe thin noodles are relatively easy to manoeuvre with chopsticks. They go very well with the delicate broth. I wonder if what people say about pasta (fat pastas for creamy sauces, thin pastas for light sauces) also applies here. \nThe mild peppery taste and the crunchy texture of fresh mizuna leaves are a lovely addition. I previously never understood the appeal of this understated green vegetable but I have now revised my opinion about it."

For me, a service charge of this magnitude is only justified in a proper sit-down restaurant with great service, which this is not. First, the server didn't get our order right. Second, the server didn't remember at the end of the meal that he had served us. Third, you don't even get a proper table and are squished in amongst others. None of these are huge issues, except when the cost of my meal magically increases by over 10%."

    "review": "Just reviewing the tonkatsu ramen.\nYelp Japan score: 3/5\nYelp UK score: 5/5\nI've travelled to remote suburbs and small towns in Japan in search of specific ramen joints, so I like to think I know a bit about it by now. And this is a decent bowl. I don't know what some of these other reviewers were served, but mine was pretty good - and so far the best I've had in London (and will likely find until Ippudo opens).  \nNoodles: A bit overcooked... they should be firmer, but this is likely a local market compromise. Next time I'll ask for firm noodles.\nBroth: Very good. The black garlic oil is great too.\nEgg: Perfect. As good, better, than any I've had before. Order an extra one.\nCharsu: Decent. I prefer it thicker, but fatty and good. \nNeeds: Some ginger or something pickled (besides garlic) to cut through the richness of the broth. \nTip: Please don't wait for your 'soup' to cool off. Ramen is about the noodles - firm noodles being sucked up coated in hot fatty soup. Slurp them, it's ok, you're allowed to slurp ramen and it cools them a bit so you don't burn your mouth to much (a little burn is part of of the experience - don't worry, you will heal). As well, letting the noodles and soup cool off, this is like being served a burger and then waiting for the melted cheese to coagulate first. Wrong, wrong, wrong. (Sorry, watched this happen a few times here.)\nFYI: The price. I know it's London and ramen is still new and trendy, but \u00a312.38 a bowl is steep. This works out to \u00a52101 or $20.46! Ouch! Tokyo is supposed to be the most expensive city in the world, but this same bowl of noodles would cost you only about \u00a5800-900 or \u00a35.40 even in the most expensive parts of Tokyo. (I know, supply chain and all that. But still... Cheaper in Tokyo!)"

The staff are fast, the food emerges pipping hot from the kitchen in minutes, and the casual environment makes it easy to jump in and out for a quick pre-theater bite--although it does get crowded with a long wait midday and at dinner, naturally. Price points are a bit high, but the quality of food makes up for it. The chicken karage is absolutely perfect. Marinated and just slightly battered, it makes for a great shared starter. The tender stem broccoli comes with a side of spicy orange sauce, which would make anyone adore green steamed yet cold-served veggies. The noodles are bit on the chewy/al dente side, but every ramen house has a different style, this is just Bone Daddies' I suppose. I'm also not a ramen fan per se, and usually stick to menu starters at ramen joints, so take my comment with a grain of salt. Beautiful presentation and an interesting broth, come here for a quick and tasty meal."

    "review": "The short is that Bone Daddies is a great Ramen place and worth your time.\nSeating is a little close quarters due to the small space and need to pack as many high standing stools as close as possible. Service is prompt and pleasant. Due to the small space, your proximity to a staff member is always less than 2 meters in any direction.\nI ordered a Tantanmen Ramen. This is the spicy minced pork variety. When it arrived it looked amazing. But I was a little disappointed as it was thick with oil. Upon tasting the broth was quite bland to the point I actually asked for a plate to remove some of it as I'm not a fan of food served like this, even if it was chilli oil. That removed, suddenly the flavours of the broth came through and it was delish. A side of fried chicken rounded things off nicely. Fried to crisp perfection, in bite sized pieces and without bones. Mmm.\nOn drinks, I ordered the Red rocket, a fizzy bright red concotion of raspberry, Yuzu and Soda. Delish and refreshing, but perhaps a bit much with the Ramen broth but great as a drink in it's own right.\nSo in all, Bone Daddies isn't a place you'll want to linger long in. It isn't designed for comfort and service is prompt and quick for a reason. It wasn't particularly busy when arriving there around 12.30pm but by 1pm it was pretty packed so advice would be to get there early as I don't believe they take bookings."

The eggs are perfect, with a creamy soft yolk. Adding chicken scratchings is a nice local touch, but I didn't feel they did much texture-wise.\nThe sides are hit and miss:\n- Deep fried soft-shell crab? Dericious.\n- Kara-age? Yes please.\n- Cabbage and miso? A little too literal. Pieces of raw cabbage served with miso paste to dip. Feels like something I would eat when the shops are closed and I'm rummaging through my fridge.\nI think Ippudo in NY generally does a better job, and rumor is that it's coming to London this year.

Not lots of space in the restaurant but the space available was always filled with people. Clearly this place is worth it's rating. \nI had heard about this restaurant through a Yelp search, and decided that it sounded like a great place to get ramen in London. The restaurant is reasonably easy to find, we just needed to ask a local where it was when Google Maps said we were close by, but we had no clue where to look. \nThere wasn't much of a line when we got there around lunch time so we were seated right away. Because I had come with my family who didn't really know much of ramen other than the plastic packets you can get in stores, they didn't have much of a clue on what was what. The staff helped them on what the different ramen where made of and what they preferred.\nWe ended up ordering one tonkotsu, two tantanmen and one T22. The ramen came reasonably quickly and they were very aesthetically pleasingly presented.\nThe tonkotsu was very, very delicious. The dark sesame oil on top gave the already amazing broth a toasted flavour. The broth was a milky colour, as would be expected of a bone marrow, and the noodles were a bit thicker than somen noodles which was a bit surprising, given that I am more used to having thicker noodles, but they tasted just fine. The ramen was topped with chashu pork, soft boiled eggs and green onion. \nThe others were very pleased with their noodles too. The tantanmen was reasonably spicy and the bokchoy on the side was very refreshing. The T22 was equally as good. \nNeedless to say we were all very, very pleased with our food. The portions were perfectly filling, although there was space for a special dessert from their menu. We ordered a sesame ice-cream to share,  which ended up being a very interesting experience since none of us had ever tasted a sesame flavoured soft serve. It was a perfect end to the meal and all of us agreed that we'd be coming back in the future. \nI ended up coming back the next day for another serving since I'd been enchanted by the ramen. You simply can't find such good ramen in Norway so I had to take advantage of the restaurants' existence."

One of the things I hate is when ramen houses are stingy with their noodles. We also ordered the kimchi side dish which wasn't real kimchi (I know kimchi, I'm Korean).  Not sure if they make it in-house, but it's not traditional and was a bit of a weird neon orange color.\n \nDrinks: They have a pretty good drink menu for a ramen house which includes sake, shochu, wine, beer and cocktails. \n \nPrice: Reasonable.  For two Tonkotsu Ramen and one side order of Kimchi came out to 28.12 GBP.\n \nAmbiance: The restaurant was packed on a Sunday evening and very lively.

Milky white and as rich as it looks, I found myself basically scraping the bowl to get the final garlicky dribbles at the bottom before making an unhappy face that it was done.\nThe nitamago (ramen egg) is perfectly done, with a bright orange yolk that just oozes into the broth. The squiggle of dark soy sauce is indeed unnecessary for taste, but the colors, o the colors. The pork actually was the least interesting part, but I suggest paleo/atkins folks will be happier with the slices? The bamboo shoots are great for breaks between indulging in the creamy noodles, and be sure to throw in just a little chili oil to kick things up a notch. There's also a garlic press with whole pickled cloves, but even I as a garlic fiend didn't think this was necessary. \nThe ramen noodles were interesting and not quite what I've had before in other places, but they do a good job of soaking up just enough broth without wilting away.\nA bowl of tonkotsu will run you \u00a311 + \u00a31 something for service, but as a once-in-a-while treat, definitely worth it.\nBig fan of the decor at Bone Daddies, with walls plastered with photos of the too-cool-for-gakkou rockabillies in Yoyogi Park. \nI'll definitely come back to try out the tantanmen or the tsukemen."

I will have nightmares about never getting to eat it again when I leave London. The sauce that was included with it was also to die for - super spicy too! The tartare came with some fried lotus chips, and the combination was like a new, japanese take on the holy grail of chips and salsa. \nA reason why I knocked Bone Daddies down a star is because it is too salty! I used to stay away from ramen places because I thought they were ALL too salty; later experiences taught me that really good ramen has salt, but it isn't distracting at all. If only Bone Daddies was a little less salty it would have been PERFECT.\nThe service was mediocre - there wasn't anything bad that happened but I have definitely had better service in many other places.

The noodles were reasonable, though I have had slightly better quality noodle.  This was not bad though.  The egg was wonderfully marinated in soy teriyaki, the pork retained it's own sweet flavor.  I really appreciated the toasted garlic.  Have not seen that one, or at least not so well executed. If you're a huge garlic fan, they also have a garlic press that allows you to add to your heart's content. Other condiments include hot chili, which I like versus the typical Japanese hot powder.\nSoft serve green tea ice cream -  5 stars! I find myself surprised that I have such high marks for ice cream.  This was particularly good.

I love this f*cking place.\nI refer to Summer 2014 as the Great Summer Of My Ramen Awakening, and it all started with Bone Daddies. These guys were my first, and it's been a slippery, noodle filled descent into a full-on obsession. \nI may wander, I may experiment, but Bone Daddies has my heart.\nAnd, with the news that they're opening in East London so near to my flat, it gives me yet another reason to never leave my Islington / Hackney nest.\nBone Daddies is London's best ramen, believe the hype."

Be considerate and eat and leave since there always seem to be  a long line waiting. I hate it when people just sit there forever after they eat, if you want to catch up, go somewhere else, be considerate when there are other people waiting for tables. We waited for around 45 mins."

    "review": "I've had a lot of ramen in my life & although Bone Daddies is pretty good, I just don't like the thick broth. It makes it so much more heavier than it should be.\nI've been here twice and have ordered the tantanmen both times. Flavor wise, it's fantastic. I love the garlic press at the table and you can even ask them for extra chilies to make your ramen spicier. Like I said, I just don't like the thickness of the broth... personal preference if you will. \nOther than that, I love the casual atmosphere and communal high-top tables. Service is very friendly and pretty good."

    "review": "Having now had the opportunity for multiple visits, I've eaten my way through all the ramens and most of the starters. My visits have produced a consistent level of food and service, which is nice\nWhat I love about the ramens is that they all taste different. Though I thought that my favourite would continue to be tonkotsu ramen, in fact my current favourite is tantanmen ramen which has the same depth of flavour in the soup but it comes with a great chilli kick - I love it but if you don't like heat, then I would recommend that you ask them to dial it down a bit\nI echo Tim L's advice to ask for cock scratchings (crispy chicken skin) which add a wonderful crunch and umami kick to the dish\nAs for starters, I prefer the salmon sahimi over the yellowtail. Crispy soft shell crab is great, especially with the spicy mayonnaise though the portion isn't the biggest. A great sharing dish with friends is the artichoke, where you can all dive in and pluck the leaves to dip them\nThe drink variety is big from no-quibble tapwater to sake (served in a traditional wooden box) all the way to cocktails\nThe only warning is that the most recent addition to the bottles of condiments on the table that you can add to the ramen is actually a bottle containing hairbands! Definitely inedible but as my dining companion today, Minnie M said, it was the perfect thing she needed to stop her hair getting into her bowl of soup. They really have thought of everything!\nPerhaps the greatest accolade for this place is that it's the sort of  place I'd be proud to bring friends. Still the best ramen in town"

And how 'bout that sesame grinder ... eh? eh?\nFried chicken: Bite sized pieces of crispy crunchy chicken - nothing new there EXCEPT, add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice from slice provided and go ahead and grind some sesame seeds on top of that. Heaven\nEdamame: Standard, but served in a good sized portion for two or four to share.\nTonkotsu with roast pork: Exactly what I hoped it would be and more. Broth was buttery and creamy and rich. Egg was perfectly cooked, noodles too. Meat was roasted perfectioness. Presentation was great too - didn't have to go hunting for the meat slices or that egg. I added cock scratchings per another reviewer's advice but it didn't do much for me. In fact, it pushed the flavour over the brink of salty/rich-ness; will not do that again. Didn't get the pipette of fat either and have no regrets.\nI had a cocktail that did not bowl me over (despite the waiter's enthusiasm for it). Can't recall its name, the watermelon one. I'd stick to beer next time.\nTips\nDO NOT USE APPLE MAPS TO FIND THIS PLACE. Just ... don't.\nWith all the other reviews I was worried it would be obnoxiously loud but I had no problem with that. But I don't feel I was warned about the cramped space. I mean really. Expect to be bumping elbows and brushing asses at every moment. Wait time was about 5 minutes for two on Saturday at 7p. No dessert menu. Two apps and two ramens was a tad too much food for two people, and way too much salt (even for this savory food addict)."

    "review": "If you like rich fatty unctuous (yes, I said that overused food critic descriptor) ramen then you can't get much better than Bone Daddies unless you go to Japan of course. This place is all hyped rock n' roll non-traditional but really does that matter as long as the ramen is good? Like I said the broth is silky smooth and super creamy - my favorite way to have ramen. The noodles are springy and the chase pork was tender. Everything was super tasty. I wish they would put out the free pickles like they do in Japan but that's a small quibble. The home made pickles are worth ordering as an appetizer and an antidote to the richness of the ramen broth. The ramen bowl was enough for me without any other snacks. I wasn't even able to finish the bowl but I've grown accustomed to ramen coming in man-sized portions.\nThey don't take reservations and they don't have a waitlist where you can leave and wander about, you'll have to wait in line and people don't rush in/out like they do in Japan so be prepared."

Okay, the owner knows something, I thought. \nThen I started to pay more attention. Yellowtail sashimi was prepped with coriander and ponzu, and they made no mistake there. The combination of junmai and yellowtail went very well. I then ordered a salmon sashimi. The salmon was prepped with puffed rice and herb and the dish was impeccable.\nRamen didn't disappoint me either. The noodle was chewy, the egg was just right, and the soup was rich but not too oily. \nI would come back when I come to London. Good job guys."

    "review": "FINALLY a tasty ramen shop in London! It's been over a year and a half since I moved here from LA and I've been so sad about the quality of Asian food here. Everything seems to fall flat, and I don't know why.\nI went with a friend and had their cabbage and miso (starter), artichoke (starter), and Tonkotsu Ramen. The starters were incredibly moreish. The cabbage reminds me of a very homey veg + dip my family eats in China and is a fab alternative to the typical edamame. The artichoke is paired with a delicious dip with just enough kick to keep you interested. We also tried a pineapple sake and Asahi beer. The beer is some special Asahi brew (I don't understand beer so don't quote me) but it stayed really cold and had a delicious rice-flavored aftertaste. The pineapple sake is dangerous -  reminds me of the fruity yogurt soju at korean bars - tastes like juice!\nBone Daddies do chashu pork really well. They do broth really well. They do their eggs so freaking well that I would push you, your mother, your grandmother, AND your little dog down the stairs to get more. Luckily for your family, you can order extra, and for a mere \u00a31. Perfectly soft-boiled and so flavorful, the egg was the star for me. I have had fantastic broth at Ippudo in NYC and Daikokuya in LA but that egg is legend. And speaking with Chef Ross, it's only going to get better. I am dancing in anticipation.\nAlmost forgot to mention another star - their homemade chili oil. Don't be intimidated by the chili flakes in there. It adds a toasty, smokey, warm heat to the ramen without being overpoweringly spicy. I think it's a must, if only because it adds yet another dimension of flavor.\nIt's a brand new restaurant so they are constantly working on their menu, broth, and noodles. I personally thought it was all amazeballs, but I certainly welcome their ambition for better.\nIf you're one of those people who think Wagamama is an acceptable place for food, do yourself a favor and get schooled by Bone Daddies."

The ambiance here is very casual, hip and on the loud side. The space can be a tad cramp but we were comfortable.\nFoodwise, I had the tonkatsu ramen while my husband had the soy ramen. My tonkatsu soup was pork bone base and as the menu stated took 20 hours to achieve its perfect rich flavor. The soy soup on the other hand is chicken base thus lighter but equally delicious (yep I had a slurp off of the mister's soup). Both soup had a descent amount of toppings (spring onions) while the noodles was just right (not too soft or hard). I cant tell if they were handmade but I found it really tasty. My only gripe here is the temperature of the soup. I thought that it could have been a bit more warmer than what I was served. Otherwise everything is good in this hood."

We ordered the tonkotsu ramen and tantanmen ramen, and they both came out in decent-sized bowls (I wouldn't call them large, though), but the ramen inside was just... not ramen. The noodles were some kind of flour noodles that you don't see in typical ramen, which made the entire texture of the dish very strange. On top of that, because they were flour noodles, they tended to clump together if you didn't separate them right when you got your bowl.\nOn the bright side, the soft-boiled egg was made perfectly, but sadly, that's the only highlight that I can say. The atmosphere of Bone Daddies is unique enough, but it's not a place I would frequent again or recommend to anyone for ramen."

I had the tonkotsu ramen and for a broth that was supposed to have been stewed for 20 hours, it really didn't taste like pork bone. Or anything for that matter. It was really thick and fragrant but it didn't actually taste like anything. Their chili oil also lacked any spice. The service was good though, the presentation of the food was nice and the place itself seems pretty hip (hence the two stars).

    "review": "This is now the second decent ish ramen place I've tried in London (after Shoryu) and I was extremely satisfied.\nFood:\nWe ordered fried chicken and pork ribs to start (though it was called pork bones or something different). The chicken was executed well and extremely tasty. The ribs were one up though. Tender, and in an awesome sauce.\nHad the Tonkotsu ramen for my main. \nBroth:\nThick and aromatic, I had high hopes. It semi delivered but just a tiny bit less flavourful than I expected. But initially at least, pretty damn good nonetheless, particularly after adding a bit of garlic.\nThe big caveat with the broth here is that there's quite a short optimum time to eat it in. Because of the thickness, as it cools down, it gets almost sedimentary and you can feel individual bits of it as it goes down your throat. At that point it gets notably less nice.\nNoodles:\nI like the texture of the noodles. Bit chewy but highly enjoyable. Their per bowl ratios are pretty off imo. Either they need more broth or less noodles in the bowl. It's really not an ideal ratio the way it's currently served.\nDrinks:\nI'm still pleasantly surprised when a place has mostly craft beers even though (fortunately) it is such a fast growing scene in this city. Had the kernel pale ale and really enjoyed it. Been meaning to head down to the Kernel brewpub (only open on Saturday for a few hours) and this has only increased said desire.\nOverall:\nWhen it comes to ramen chains no matter how many places I try I seem to have hardcore ippudo loyalty. This is the closest I've had to that in London, so I know I'll be back (and soon)."

    "review": "In the centre of Soho, Bone Daddies is a new ramen joint. It seems to be a mark of hipness not to have a  name or sign anymore on new places lest you might be guilty of not being cool enough to need a sign ...(hint it's next to Byron burger which does have a sign)... in fact I didn't see it at first because I thought it WAS Bryon burger. OK I clearly failed on that test of personal hipness.\nInside it has a utility interior - fairly compact and packed  already just a few days after opening with high counters and stools. Our group of Yelpers managed to straddle across the counter and the some of the window seats. The vibe is dim lighting,  loud music and competing conversations.\nStarted with the yellowtail sashimi which was really good. Presented on little wooden stakes it was very fresh and with a flavourful dressing plus coriander.\nI had to order the Tonkotsu ramen which is always tempting but also more challenging to deliver successfully, apparently. Our orders arrived quite quickly which was good. The Tonkotsu ramen was the best I have had so far on our Ramen outings.\nThe stock was perfect. Rich, flavourful, savoury, complex, fatty without appearing oily. Perhaps that's the magic of the claimed 20 hour cooking where the stock and bony goodness emulsifies together. This one delivered. The noodles were great too. Special note to the toppings and the super good egg, as others have noted. The pork was the best version I have had  in London and super tender and melt in the mouth fat and meat. \nQuantity wise it wasn't a huge portion but was rich and had plenty of noodles and I have to admit I was fully satisified afterwards. Perhaps a bit more stock would have been good.\nThe only slight negative was that it wasn't very hot so didn't need to do that loud slurpy thing since it was cool enough to eat direct. Would have preferred it a bit hotter.\nAccompanied by a nice Sake in a box.\nService was prompt and enthusiastic.\nThe only minor gripe for me was that the music was too loud, set at the volume level where you have to shout a bit, even to speak to the person sitting next to you. I don't know if others prefer it that way, maybe it's just me.\nPricing was relatively reasonable compared with other places and the quality was high and the meal was very enjoyable so a great combination overall."

It is simply divine, and the portion sizes are guaranteed to leave you satisfied. \nI've tried a few of the ramen bowls they have here and love most of them. The T22 is probably my die hard favourite. As other people have said, you could probably get slightly more authentic ramen elsewhere; this is somewhat westernized ramen. That being said, it's still very delicious. Ingredients like the egg and cock scratchings are always done perfectly. Bone Daddies is also very allergen friendly. They're always happy to customize a dish for you.\nBesides for the ramen...\nThe fried chicken is one of my favourite starters. I couldn't possibly recommend it more. However, I don't love the pork/corn croquettes, and I think most of their sashimi is somewhat overpriced. \nI've had some sort of green tea sesame alcoholic smoothie there once that was on their specials board. It was divine and I keep hoping they'll bring it back sometime. Their other milkshakes, when they have them, are often equally good. \nAs a last tip, make sure you have a fair bit of time on your hands.

    "review": "There is a lot to like about Bone Daddies but since I've become an obsessive fan of Tonkotsu ramen I have developed my own standards. With ramen I find it hard to judge because the broth can varied each day especially when you make it in large quantities at once unlike other dishes where you mostly cook it one at a time. So if I have a 'bad' ramen it could just be a 'bad' day but of course consistency would be great to have, just harder to get. I do usually go at least twice we confirm my judgement but this review is purely based on one lunch visit.\nBone Daddies is very well lit, white and red walls, trying to get in colours of Japan maybe? High stools which I never have been a fan of but it creates a quick turnover so Iess queuing. I would associate it more a quick lunch or dinner as it does get packed as seating is limited so trying so trying to get a group of friends to dine here is not ideal. It's place you are very likely to be seating next to a complete stranger if you have an available seat next to you so no room for personal space here.Still I love the laboratory feel to it with the random jars containing condiments to hair bands and even bibs for those messy eaters. Makes life a lot easier for those who keep dropping their chopsticks and could just use the mini self service area and pick a new pair up conveniently.\nSo I my lunch order was the obvious choice of Tonkotsu whilst my boyfriend ordered the kimchee seafood ramen which uses fish broth instead of mine being pork. We both ordered an extra egg too for \u00a31 which is very reasonable as some places sell it at \u00a32.50!! I only managed to have a few sip of the kimchee broth and a feel mussels and already felt the intense heat and spice kick in. There was a generous amount of seafood of prawns and mussels. The broth was slightly sweet for easier consumption but I'm not going to review anymore as it would be wrong of me to judge based on a few sips.\nSo moving on to my Tonkotsu, as much as I enjoyed the thick creamy broth and the firm bouncy noodles the broth really did needed depth. Creamy and thick was all it was but flavour wise it was lacking. Although we were given the choice to add whole cloves of garlic in the broth with the garlic presser as well I felt my broth was definitely hungry for some. I suppose I'm just used to tonkotsu having many notes of flavour. But texture and ingredients compensated on all that was lost to make it still enjoyable with a nice addition of black sesame oil for presentation and some flavour. The pork belly was incredibly tender throughout, generously sliced in perfect thickness. Eggs top notch, rich egg yolk still runny inside and gently seasoned. Nice crunches came from the beansprouts and bamboo too. \nIf I was purely reviewing on the ramen this meal would have been a 3 out of 5 but overall with the quick service, decor, menu choices it grabbed itself an extra star, Will need to go again to try it's other ramen though as I do want this place to do well. It definitely has the potential."

Since then I tried many of the shops and restaurants in London and there are some decent eateries out there, but this one is my new favorite. The menu is simple with a good range of ramen plus some rather nice side dishes. We had a spicy version and a normal meat version and both very delicious. I have to say that the broth was amazing. So full of flavour with a near silky texture ... it was pure pleasure. The ingredients of the soup were also very nice, with eggs, which were still a bit gooey in the middle and meat which was very tender and nicely seasoned. I haven't eaten such nice ramen in absolutely ages. \nI will definitely go again ... and bring all my friends with me."

Normally the eggs are supposed the be deliciously warm and runny and cook in the hot broth. I hate leaving negative reviews but hopefully it helps the restaurant for the future....warm up your broth its soup for goodness sake."

I went to Bone Daddies on a weeknight by myself, and there was still a queue, though I got a seat with a minimal wait. Being gluttonous, I got the soft shell crab starter and the kimchee ramen. The crab was fine, though I wouldn't get it again for the size and price. The ramen was quite delicious and surprisingly spicy. Maybe even a touch too spicy? I feel a little ashamed saying that. But very delicious indeed. The noodles and egg were perfect.\nThe music was a bit too loud for my preference. I would have been hard pressed to maintain a conversation with someone.

Maybe I have been spoiled with ramen from Japan, maybe I have been spoiled with free ramen at the office, maybe I have been spoiled since my bf can literally eat ramen everyday, but this is just not ramen. I ordered the tonkotsu broth and it was pretty plain. Tell me how a pork boned broth that has been stewed for 16 hours can be bland? Beats me. We also ordered 2 orders of the fried soft shelled crab, popcorn chicken and chinese broccolli. Firstly, the sauces accompanied with the appetizers are all a bit weird. Perhaps because the British love mayo? Everything was mayo based..broccoli with mayo? For the love of god, wwhy?!?! Nevermind that, I also ordered corn as an addition to my ramen and it was this smoked corn. Kinda cool, but didn't vibe well with my ramen. Think of grilled smoked corn bits in your flavorless ramen.

At 5:30pm, it was already packed, which is a good sign. Hubs got the tonkotsu and I ordered the spicy miso ramen. Great broth and good noodles. Pork were ample and eggs cooked perfectly. What a great dinner! They even provide plastic bibs for you to wear...which most people did not use, but I did just because. Another surprising and amusing touch was a jar offering hair bands for the ladies with long hair -- because it's annoying to have hair falling into your face as you labor over the lovely soup and noodles! There was even a garlic crusher with garlic on the counter and a sesame grinder for additional flavor. Great place. Don't miss."

    "review": "Despite the mixed reviews, I decided to try Bone Daddies on a chilly Tuesday night before a gig at Madame Jojo's around the corner. We arrived at 6:40pm to find the queue already out the door, but were assured that the wait was no longer than 15 minutes. Waiting in the bitter cold certainly increased our craving for a hot bowl of soup, and luckily we were seated just 10 minutes later at the bar facing the street window. \nAfter unsuccessfully trying to make ourselves comfortable on the bar stools, we ordered the following dishes:\n+Spicy Kimchi Ramen with Prawns, Mussels, Egg, and Corn in Fish Broth - Though not listed online, our amicable server assured us that this dish (his favourite) has become a permanent fixture on the menu. This aggressively spiced soup exceeded my expectations and is now one of my favourite noodle-based soups in London. The opaque red broth coated the ramen noodles in a clean fish flavour with a strong kick from the chilli. The lightly fried prawns and mussels that topped the soup were tasty, but the amount of seafood was a bit skimpy.\n+Tantanmen Ramen with Sesame, Chilli, Pork Mince, and Bok Choy in Chicken Bone Broth - This soup tasted mainly of peanut butter, which was an unpleasant surprise to my bf. Though we were warned that the dish contains peanuts (in case of an allergy), the predominant peanut flavour should be mentioned in the description.\n+Pickle Plate - A well-executed plate with a variety of pickled vegetables (cauliflower, daikon, carrots, beets), kimchi, and pickled Asian pear. A must for any lover of pickled foods.\nI also ordered a Maiken-Me cocktail (shochu, ume shu, watermelon, salt) which unfortunately tasted like the nondescript cocktails served at karaoke bars around London and cost nearly as much as a bowl of ramen. Save your money.\nI thoroughly enjoyed my seafood ramen with kimchi, but am not sure I would try any of the other broths on the menu after struggling with a few spoonfuls of my boyfriend's Tantanmen. I am not generally a fan of tonkotsu broth to begin with though, so I found the lighter flavour and consistency of the fish broth welcome. However, Bone Daddies should be more explicit about the strong peanut taste in their Tantanmen ramen. Many people (including my boyfriend, unfortunately) have a strong aversion to the taste of peanut butter, which the broth resembled after it had cooled. The Tantanmen ramen reduces my rating of Bone Daddies from four stars to three. \n(Visited November 2013)"

So take this review with a grain of salt.\nMy girlfriend and I came visiting London to try out some of the tastiest food stops we could find on Yelp and through other review sites. We are both huge ramen fanatics, so we had to give London's highest reviewed ramen shops a stop. Unfortunately we were left disappointed. \nWe ordered the tonkotsu ramen and the tantanmen ramen. The portions were decent. The price was decent for London standards as well. But the ramen....was just not ramen noodles. In fact, the ramen noodles reminded me more of pasta noodles than anything else. (Completely different type of noodles.) \nThe broth itself had a strong peanut taste to it, and didn't taste like pork broth at all. Bear in mind that authentic tonkotsu broth is supposed to be created by slow cooking the fattiest pork belly for over six hours to create rich and intense flavors.\nIf this was named something other than ramen, then I would probably say it's a decent eat. But to take the name of ramen and to create something completely different....\nWell. I definitely can't be recommending the ramen here to anyone. If you're ever in Japan, Los Angeles, or San Francisco---definitely stop by some of the highly reviewed ramen shops there so you can taste what real ramen tastes like."

I'm DEFINITELY glad I ordered it, because the egg was delicious. The broth was delicious and rich, so rich I couldn't finish it in the end, though my friend happily did. There's ample noodles so although the price seems a bit steep for what it looks, it is DEFINITELY filling and worth the money. The only downside I have is that the pork could have been cut into smaller pieces instead of just laid in one sheet on top of everything - made for some awkward chop stick work!\nOn the table is garlic and a garlic press, as well as little bowls of chilli paste, perfect for both of us who like our food spicy and garlicky. You eat around a table communally with others, and although it seems a little tight there's enough space for everyone to be comfortable (unlike the awkward shoulder-to-shoulder seating at Flat Iron). \nI've been dying to come here after a bunch of good reviews and I'm so glad I did!

There comment was it was a shame that they also didn't serve gyoza to go alongside the ramen.\nWhen we arrived on a Saturday evening we didn't have to wait long for a table and while we were waiting they served us drinks from the bar.  The beer wasn't too badly priced and the ramen was around \u00a310, which is the same at a lot of other ramen places I've been too in London.  We found out that the chef is Australian but of Japanese descent and that you can request your noodles hard or soft, which is authentic to the cuisine.\nI ordered the dipping ramen, this is a cold ramen dish perfect for a hot summers day.  The dip that it comes with is hot though.  I do like this dish but I find it a bit trickier to eat using the dipping sauce and always feel there isn't enough.

The ingredients on top were cold, as Eve mentions (pity I didn't read her review before going) and the broth was warm at best.

I opted for a special, the Sour Pepper Ramen, with roast chashu, karaage salmon, grilled spring onion and an egg.  The broth was perfectly judged with its deep spicy flavour providing a solid base for its accompaniments.  Indeed, the broth was so lovely, I would probably have been satisfied with this alone.  Of the accompaniments, I loved each delicate flake of the salmon and the perfect texture of the egg.  However, the best aspect of the dish was its variety.

    "review": "So the trouble with Ramen in London is that most of the ramen places are still predominantly offering Tonkotsu based ramen with pretty thin noodles. I think the reason why they do this is due to the local palate and familiarity with this type of ramen.\nHowever, I'm afraid my favourite ramen is made with a miso/chicken based soup with a much thicker noodle with lots of fresh bean sprouts, spring onions, bamboo and sweetcore. Ideally served with a nice strip (not a slice) of fatty oily cha shu pork on the side.\nIt's a good place to visit and the atmosphere is pretty vibrant (it's in Soho!). I guess the owners haven't dared to venture too far beyond what the local customers are familiar with. One further example of this is that a popular Japanese drink, calpis is not on the menu but can be ordered as a cocktail?!\nOkay, if you ask them very nicely they will serve this for you but I guess it's just too foreign for them to want to list it on the menu. Overall, the place is not bad for a bowl of ramen if you're desperate but I honestly have had much better (and cheaper!) in other countries.\nSadly this is a common trend in London where foreign palates needs to be adapted to the local established expectations. It's more a comment on the lack of adventure and acceptance of exotic flavours of Londoners.\nMaybe I need to reset my own expectations in order to really enjoy what this place is all about."

I couldn't stop licking my fingers. I also tried the hamachi sashimi appetizer which was wonderfully fresh with a hint of ponzu.\nFor my ramen, I chose the tonkatsu ramen because of the 20 hour pork broth.

Get your own. \nI thought the service was friendly and quite good, we stayed for an hour and they never rushed us once, despite the queue of people waiting. \ni must be in the minority of not thinking this place was great, because I showed up at 11.45 and by 12pm, there was a queue of Asian families behind me. So, I guess you had better go and make up your own mind about the place. I probably won't be back."

    "review": "And finally, something on the UK ramen scene worth writing and raving about! \nNo more of that tasteless clear broth with no fat or oil on the surface, this is the real deal - Hakata style tonkotsu! Such eerie, cloudy and unbelievably unhealthy broth yet oh so nourishing - and that's the charm of it. Pretty standard toppings, nicely made egg, and yes, as much garlic and chili as you would dare to add. \nThe big thing going for Bone Daddies is the tonkotsu broth. The noodles aren't exceptional, nor are the sides, or probably even many of the other dishes, but that's fine. The tonkotsu broth makes up for it, in droves. \nIt's got a wonderful little atmosphere, it's obviously in a great part of town, and if you head there at the right time there will be a queue - that's the sign of a good ramen joint in my books. \nGet the tonkotsu, that's the signature dish. I would be happy if they stopped making the other types of ramen, and just focussed on perfecting it, but since when have you seen a restaurant in the UK focus on one thing only? \nAnd finally, only 4 stars because the other broths really aren't worth writing home about, the ch\u0101sh\u016b is cut way too thin, and the noodles are a bit meh... But really these are minor gripes, so go forth and set yourself a new ramen baseline."

    "review": "The latest in our Ramen Club outing was to Bone Daddies, the hip new noodle joint in Soho that's staying true to Japanese way of life. It's the latest in the trend so the core challenge is to differentiate itself. Now we (mostly me, but this is based on discussions with said Ramen Club too) judge ramen on a number of categories: Noodles, veggies and associated toppings, meat, egg, and of course the all important broth!.\nNoodles - Cooked perfectly with just a hint of resistance in each bite. I find that too often the noodles are cold (not enough time out of the fridge before the broth is poured in) or mushy (cooked and then broth is added). So this was a noodle win topped only by Tonkotsu's offering.\nVeggies & toppings - The veggies in my bowl were crunchy and flavourful so my one gripe would be that there weren't enough of them. The toppings were sparse in the bowl but I appreciate that you can add from a variety of items on the table. There is a sesame seed grinder (I've never ground sesame into anytime but it helped bulk out the broth) and a garlic press with fresh garlic cloves (brilliant idea!). The one thing lacking was extra fresh chilli although to be fair there was some chilli oil (just not my thing).\nMeat - This was the disappointment in the dish. I found the meat to be lacking in substance in both form and flavour. Cocoro still wins in my book for best meat although Ittenbari would be a close second.\nEgg - Let me qualify this by saying I don't like egg. I have it scrambled and occasionally poached with salmon but it really isn't my thing. I haven't enjoyed it at any other Ramen place but at Bone Daddies it was incredible and I wanted another one. Yes, it's that good.\nBroth - I opted for the 20 hour Tonkotsu broth. It's thick and rich and full of meaty (and fatty!) goodness. If there isn't enough fat for you, you can opt for an extra pipette of fat for 50p. One of the better broths in London and perfect for a cold wintry day (like today) and only beat by the spicy Tonkotsu from Cocoro. Man, I wish I could have a bowl of it now!\nOverall, it was one of the best bowls of Ramen I've had in London. Individually, I don't think most of the components were worthy of the top spot but put together it's incredible. Also special note to the manager for his impeccable customer service in dealing with our large group (and remembering YGO who came a few days earlier), the bartender for taking the time to talk about Japanese whiskey with me (and gave me a free taster), and our sassy waitress for impeccable banter."

Rock-n-roll Asian paraphernalia is plastered all over the walls as the most awesome music sets you in the mood to devour a huge bowl of ramen. I've been here at least 4 times, with varying sizes of groups, and every time we've been accommodated in the nicest of ways. There are more than a few delicious choices to make. If you're having trouble deciding, the staff know the menu backwards and forwards. They'll help you out.\nMy usual here is the Tamtamen 2. Nutty broth, cashews, chicken, veggies, GET IN MY BELLY. While it's on the spicier side, it's not too bad. Just the right amount of punch. I can never finish a whole bowl there's so much to eat! I stuff myself until I can't anymore and then mourn over the loss of uneaten ramen. I wish they had places like this in the States because it's just fantastic! It does tend to get a bit crowded during the lunch and dinner rush, but turnover is quick. Also keep in mind that they close in between lunch and dinner!\nThis is a must-eat if you're in the Soho area!"

Besides, all you really need to know is that Bone Daddies belongs right in Soho, with its trendy wall decor, trendy menu on a clipboard, trendy good looking people (hello good looking people).\nI walked here on 9 pm Tuesday, and was surprised how busy it still was even an hour before closing, but was relieved to be seated promptly at a communal table.  I have no shame eating alone when it comes to the ramen call of duty.\nOrdered the \u00a38.8 Unnamed cocktail (Nikka All Malt, Pink Peppercorn Vanilla, Ume Shu) which was served quite bitter in a martini glass and very strong, but I'm all for pre appetizer inebriation.\nAlso ordered the \u00a35 fried chicken, a little bucket containing 8 morsels of Asian style fried chicken with a slice of lemon, and finished it all myself... to the obvious amazement by my wide-eyed waiter. It was a bit salty and lacked seasoning but the lemon helped dispense some flavor.\n20 minutes post chicken inhalation, my \u00a311 Tonkotsu ramen finally came.  It was decent, with two soft boiled egg yolks shining like a beacon amidst waves of noodle and a sea of creamy broth.  I compare all ramen places to Ippudo in NYC, and I'm sure my standards will reset yet again when I go to Japan.  I liked the place, but wasn't slurping out of my bowl like a human vacuum the way I do when I'm at Ippudo.   Something was missing- maybe it was that the broth wasn't as flavorful (although putting in the chilli oil did wonders) and maybe the noodles weren't as starchy.\nIn any case, I liked Bone Daddies and would come back to try the other ramen offerings."

I was blown away by the flavours of my chicken-based T22 soup with added corn, which unexpectedly pipped my wife's Tonkotsu for taste and appearance.  We also enjoyed the beautiful pickled fruit and vegetables, salty fried chicken and far too many of the garlic cloves that are at your disposal.\nAnd of course, as a molecular biologist I also had to order the pipette. A dollop of extra fat (presumably duck) didn't actually do much for the already-fatty T22. Perhaps it's more needed for some of the other soups which we'd love to come back and try - especially the Chinese-inspired Tantamen.\nThe only negatives were that the big bowls only come half-full and could easily fit in a little more broth, and that the over-chatty staff coming and asking you how you're doing every five minutes takes away from the Ramen experience, especially when not one of them is Japanese."

Walking inside, the music was loud, we could barely hear each other but we all know that's the trick in this kind of places.\nSo queuing, ok past that. We're off to decide on food. Simple menu, few dishes, mix and match. Got the Tantamen and the Soft shell crab, as so many people do in such places.\nI thought the soft shell crab in nearby Shoryu ramen was OKish, well I take it all back, that was awesome compared to what I tasted at Bone Daddies. Most flavourless, oily and soggy piece of crab I'd ever had in my life. Such a disappointment and practically too expensive for \u00a38.50.\nPast that, off to the noodles. The noodles were nice. The flavours were bold, too bold for my liking. I think the adaptation of rock-n-roll-esque decor, they tingled with the taste to be liked by the UK audience. Nothing wrong with that but my bowl tasted like a race of bold flavours. There was a lot of oil in my sauce (that only made them taste more delicious) but the profile was completely different to what I've had before. It wasn't bad - it was actually pretty nice but strong! I find it hard to say that I didn't enjoy it, but at the same time I wasn't head over heels.\nThat's why the three starts. Its a pleasant experience.

More noodle soup places need to do this\n* The fried chicken is awesome\n*  The Asahi smooth head is really great (never seen it in the UK before)\n*  The food really is so, so good\nBut it just misses 5 stars because:\n* I don't like the atmosphere, it's too loud, crowded and I'm pretty short (5'4) which means I am so far from the ground on the stools it's slightly concerning\n* There's nowhere to put your bag or coat if you're on the side of the table nearest the door\n* The service is erratic. Doesn't bother me so much but our fried chicken we ordered came half an hour after our ramens, even though we asked after it twice, which was slightly annoying as it would have been delicious before, but after we were all a bit greased out\n* Please, please give your noodles a little more spring and bounce! For me that would crown this the perfect ramen!\n* My bowl was slightly lacking in stock, there wasn't enough to slurp with each spoonful of noodles and I felt I was running out\nNext time I would come at an unusual time so it wasn't SO packed (although the food was so good I'm perfectly happy to queue for 20 minutes again.

And it was glorious.\nAlong with several of the others, I ventured for the tonkotsu ramen and there isn't anything more I can say than what the others have already said, but I'll go ahead and repeat!  Oh, that broth.  That broth was so tasty.  And Yee Gan graciously shared his pipette of fat with me, which made the broth even tastier!  How often do you get to share a pipette of fat with someone?  Not often.  It cracks me up just typing it out.  There were some sprouts, but nothing overpowering, and they softened up nicely in the bowl.  I think it may have been marginally better if the noodles had been slightly harder in the beginning as they were quite soft by the end.  I couldn't finish my bowl due to the almost overly generous portion of noodles.  But they were very, very tasty!\nThat egg is the stuff of my dreams.  I was looking over at Katie and Rob's bowls with a bit of jealousy as they had the foresight to order a spare egg.  The yolk is so buttery!  Om nom nom.  All the extras on the table really added to the dish.  I know I probably should have tried my first ramen without any additives, but when you're given a garlic press to play with, how can one resist?!  The pork slices in the ramen were so tender and were falling apart upon contact.  And with just a bit of fattiness, they added to the rich broth and my half-fat pipette delightfully.\nI ordered the yellowtail starter which was really nice, but nothing outstanding.  Just good, fresh sashimi with a bit of chili, cilantro (because I'm a Texan and can't get behind \"coriander\") and some soy.  I tried a bit of Rob's fried chicken and agree that it just wasn't quite crispy enough.  Think chick-fil-a nuggets without the pickle juice marinade, if you've ever had them.  Also had a bit of Yee Gan's soft shell crab, which was tasty and came with a lovely, spicy sauce, but also could have used a bit more crunch.\nMy first Bone Daddies ramen will most certainly not be my last!"

As I was rushing to something else, so I just ordered Tonkotsu (Pork) Ramen, which seemed to be the only option in my opinion, because all other ramen comes with chicken broth. I am no expert in ramen, but I have eaten enough of it to develop a taste for thick and creamy broth that only seems to come with pork bone broth. I was not disappointed, as a matter of fact, I think it is the best ramen I tried in London! The broth was thick and creamy, the noodle was al dente and the eggs had semi-runny yolk. It was perfect. If I had to complain about one thing, I wish I had a bit more broth! Oh, yes, don't forget to help yourself and add some extra fixings to you bowl: you can grind your own sesame (please do, it adds so much taste to your noodle), mesh you own garlic (only for the brave and no meeting other people afterwards eaters), and chili oil.

The queue for a table was 45 minutes' worth when we showed up, longer for those in parties of more than two people. Long wait times seem to be the way of the world at the moment for the hotly-tipped eateries of the moment (e,.g. Meat Mission, Honest Burgers, Burger and Lobster etc). Ordinarily I'm a huge and vocal sceptic as to whether food can be worth waiting that kind of time for. Surely it can't be THAT much better than rival, less heralded places?\nBut Bone Daddies proved it most certainly can be. The Tonkotsu Ramen I went for, with extra egg was the best ramen I've had and a well thought out dish comprised of pork, veg, ramen noodles and a mild but well-balanced and welcome seasoning. My dining companion's Tantamen was spicier but similarly well-received. Furthermore, it was filling. My appetite's increased recently due to my stepping up of various sports but I was not disappointed with the portion size. Yum!\nThe service was incredible too. Friendly, and willing to engage in banter about possible connections between Bone Daddies' menu and the movie Donnie Darko (yes!). Accurate as to how much longer we'd have to wait for and then helpful in steering us relative ramen newbies to recommended dishes. And complete with an unexpected surprise too: after we sang their praises and said that we'd like to help them in return by giving back their table (we had a movie to run for), the waiter arrived with the bill, declaring that as we'd been such nice customers he'd taken 10% off!! What the....? Before this happened this place was lighting up those five stars - now it was making the case for a bonus sixth.\nThrow in the rockin' music (think 70s rock) faintly reminiscent of Meat Mission but not turned up to 11 and I had a great time here.

To lift the spirits, I dragged my boyfriend to Bone Daddies for an early supper on the way home.  I suspect I was in the queue mentioned by the first reviewer (I overheard him talking about Cocoro!)\nWe ordered chicken karaage, yellowtail sashimi and edamame to start.  As mentioned in a previous review, the karaage was not crispy and I, too, believe that it may have been preperared and reheated.  The flavour was correct but overall it was disappointing -- afterall, what is fried chicken without its crispy shell?  The yellowtail sashimi was also nothing special: fish slices drenched in a non-descript soy-based dressing and sprinkled with coriander leaves.\nOne portion of tonkotsu ramen, one portion of chicken tantanmen ramen.  Both came out barely warm which makes clear how these dishes are prepared.  \nMethod: \n1. Put stone-cold ramen noodles into bowl\n2. Ladle broth over noodles\n3. Top with more stone-cold (pre-prepared) ingredients: split soft-boiled soy-braised egg, meat (char siu slices in case of tonkotsu, minced chicken in case of tantanmen), soy-braised bamboo shoots, beansprouts and wakame\n4. Serve\nBone Daddies, this doesn't work.  Basic formula: cold ingredients + soup that is not hot enough = lukewarm noodle soup dish.  Any Asian will tell you that prior to constructing any noodle soup dish the noodles must be dunked into a vat of boiling stock or water.  This heats up the noodles which then ensures that the noodle dish is hot.  Or, failing that, just ensure that your broth is nuclear hot.\nThis all detracted from what could've been two very flavourful broths.  Unfortunately, we couldn't tell (although I think the tonkotsu had potential): heat brings out flavour, remember.\nI had high hopes for this place but, like in any good ol' black and white love story, slipped out of the joint into the damp night with a heavy heart."

Job well done.  The bowl of tonkotsu I received last night was basically Gojira in ramen form.  Not only does it look fantastic, but the taste doesn't let it down - the slabs of pork are delicious and falling apart, veg in the soup add just the right amount of crunch, and the fried garlic topping is a great little bonus.  The real star of the show, however, is the egg.  Not only do you get a whole egg (not everywhere can say that), but they are perfectly soft and totally delicious - however they do them, they are amazing.  Job well done.  \nOn top of that, there is a plethora of condiments to choose from - on the table is a sesame grinder, soy sauce, pot of chilli oil (the kind with chilli flakes in it), and the pot of pickled garlic and a garlic crusher.  Awesome.  Oh, and you can also get additional toppings too for a couple of extra pence here and there: nori, pulled chicken, pork mince, extra egg, and - the big one - a pipette of fat.  Hey, as much as I love my arteries, I think I love pork fat a little bit more.\nThe side dishes on offer include softshell crab, yellowfin sashimi, and fried chicken (obviously in a bucket).  The fried chicken was tasty, although is wasn't particularly crispy which was a let down.  Still, you get a decent quantity for your \u00a35.  The other sides were good, although I wasn't blown away.\nOn Josy's recommendation, I went for the hot Junmai sake which was nice and very clean tasting, although I cannot profess to be an expert in such matters.  The drinks menu is pretty comprehensive generally, containing a range of cocktails, a large selection of Japanese whisky, and a few sake options.\nOverall, I had a great experience with the Yelp crew and the staff were ever helpful (even if we did have a ridiculous number of people and kept sending them to get water).  The decor is cool too with a mixture of retro and vintage Japanese photos and Asahi adverts...however, the jars on the shelf on the back wall look like they contain Alien foetuses, and there are no Lucky Cats anywhere to be seen.  What's that all about?!\nBone Daddies is very very good, and I'm looking forward to returning soon.  It's a bit annoying that ramen in this country isn't really a cheap-and-good-thing like it is in, say, the States, and ultimately \u00a311 for a good tonkotsu is great considering that Wagamama's ramen is hitting double-digits these days.  However, I will take solace in the fact that Bone Daddies will always be able to provide me with a noodle soup to keep hunger locked up until, well, whenever the pork fat un-congeals from my stomach."

Second and third time because I kept reading reviews about how good it is, so I figured maybe I ordered the wrong thing?\nI still remain disappointed. To me the broth tastes very one dimensional- donkotsu was super greasy and creamy (like cream of mushroom consistency, or for Americans, thanksgiving gravy consistency!!) but did not have multiple layers of tastes (the way the broth does at Ippudo New York for example, or the many ramen places in Tokyo.) same for miso and shoyu ramens. They make such a big deal of the fact that they \"stew the donkotsu for 20 hours\" but what's the point if all you can taste is pork fat?! I had to sprinkle 4-5 teaspoons of hot chili oil to make it more palatable (and I don't normally like spicy food) but even the red chili oil/sauce had no kick at all. (I am now thinking that maybe I should have ordered the spicy miso...) \nThey are also super stingy with the toppings and the amount of noodles. I ordered some additional nori and they gave me 2 small sheets the size of half of my palm! (And turns out the the original doesn't even come with nori to begin with...) the amount of noodles was so small, I couldn't help but wonder how guys bigger than me could possibly be satisfied with just one bowl of ramen? The noodles do not have a good texture. They are almost somen-like. And I still ended up paying 12.60 pounds for it..which I guess is a good deal for a sit-down meal in central London.. But still. (And as a side note, what's with this custom of automatically including service charge on the listed price?  It's not a huge difference, but I find this slightly annoying since it feels like some sort of gimmick to charge you more without making you realize it.\nBack to the ramen: I have come across ramen places of this style in Tokyo too (super greasy but one dimensional broth) and I didn't like it there either, so maybe it's a matter of taste. But a part of me is thinking that if I am the only asian-looking person there all three times I went, it's not particularly a good sign...

It tasted divine with my noodles and I thought it could have been a dish of its own but actually, since they marinate the eggs first (kudos as not all ramen restaurants do) it might be too salty to eat on its own. And surprisingly everyone's dish around me also had a perfect looking egg. Not easy to clone perfection! Okay, enough about eggs.\nUnfortunately, you won't get your choice of staggering ramen permutations here, i.e. there is no option for soft or hard noodles and I'm not sure if they will give the option upon request. Try next time and tell me if it works! The noodles I had were thin springy goodness and not too soft, but not al dente either. Eat quickly before they get soggy. Noodles don't taste homemade but I can't have it all! You're probably not likely to ask for lighter broth either; it comes very rich and creamy already but if you want even more thickness, you can add extra fat!! Oh, and the bowl is super big but the broth and toppings only fill half the bowl. The bowl was begging for me to fill it with more noodles or broth so I will make a note to order extra next time. Overall, for 11 pounds, I'd say the meal was pretty worth it. \nI also had a Mr. Sparkle which was a virgin drink with orange juice..grapefruit juice..and oolong tea...there might be something else but that was basically what it tasted like. Contrary to its name, there is no sparkle - as in, it is not bubbly. It didn't particularly stand out as you can tell I have a hard time describing it ..unlike my rambling soliloquy about eggs. However, if you're looking for a clean and light grapefruity drink to try, then order this. Otherwise, go bold with the sakes :) \nAmbience-wise, the restaurant was really quite loud. The place was popping on a Tuesday night. I went during dinner and needed to shout to communicate and had a hard time hearing others. But most of the time is spent stuffing your mouth with food anyways, so it's not too unfortunate."

    "review": "The egg! Oh... the egg.\nPerfectly marinated, soft, gooey centre... Glad I ordered an extra one.\nI had the corn butter miso ramen-- SUPER rich, velvety and quite buttery soup. The thing that makes this ramen great is the attention to detail- the corn is clearly fresh, not frozen and charred before being tossed into the bowl. They give a fresh crunch to the dish. Perfectly cooked noodles with good bite/chew, lots of goodies in the bowl (sprouts, bamboo shoots, shredded chicken, wakame, etc.) with a variety of textures (though I wish the fried garlic that came on the tonkotsu ramen was available as an extra for the other dishes-- I had fried garlic envy!). Plus, I love condiments, and the pickled garlic, chilli oil, sesame seed grinder, and soya pot were fun to play with and allowed me to customize my bowl. Since the broth was so rich with butter, I didn't feel like it needed the extra pipette of fat that others agreed enhanced the tonkotsu broth. \nAs others have said, the Karaage chicken (fried chicken as they call it) had the right flavour, but wasn't crispy enough. That said, in spite of that, I REALLY liked it and would order it again. Perhaps it is the container that they use? Though attractive, perhaps too close of quarters with the steam?\nOnly two gripes: There were some cartilagey-bits with my chicken (like, crunch-ow kinds), but to be expected, I think, in a chicken broth (though I would have preferred to not have those). And, as another reviewer has said, my broth wasn't nearly hot enough. Now, I've heard that some ramen places don't serve their broth piping hot on purpose, as a warmer broth is the more optimum temperature for appreciating the depth of the broth. If this is what they are going for, they should outright say it. Otherwise, I think they need to watch this-- I was surprised how luke-warm it was. \nService was good, friendly, and accommodating (though I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group in the future since they don't take reservations). \nI'll be back, and soon. Double egg again for sure. \n(but please put a mirror in the loo!)"

I don't care for the furnishings and the complete lack of sound-absorbing materials means that the place is an acoustic fustercluck, but the food and the service is good.\nThankfully offering more than three viable choices (I'm looking at you, Tonkutsu and Ittenbari) the menu is semi-traditional. Thank gods they didn't try to over-fusion anything.\nA pattern I've noticed with fairly good r^2 is that food quality is inversely proportional to pages of menu used to describe the ingredients, process, ritual sacrifices and ablutions involved in making the noodles. Bonedaddies' food menu fits on one page (on a clipboard, neat-o!).\nI had a T22 which I chose a) because I was ramening with someone who keeps Kosher and b) because I couldn't resist COCK SCRATCHINGS (think chicken pork scratchings), which were more than just a novelty ingredient.\nToppings are varied and interesting, ranging from just meat, nori, eggs and the raved-about pipette-o-fat to the Xzibit-pleasing \u00a32 extra portion of noodles (Yo Dawg, I herd u liek ramen so we put some ramen in ur ramen...)\nDrinks are good but not cheaper than any restaurant, sochu is decent, Japanese whiskey range is luckily wider than Suntory.\nService is chirpy and is adorably cool-because-I-joke-around-with-customers rather than cool-because-I-look-down-on-people-buying-my-food-and-paying-my-wages.\nAll in all, a pretty decent joint for 10-quid noodles (actually 12-quid for brosized noodles).\nProtip: get the traditional pickles to share if you're having a bony stock; acidity offsets the heavy creaminess delightfully. Also, this sucker is open pretty late on a weekday."

I've gone several times to confirm and I have - the ramen is just not that tasty. It's OK.

The waiters were friendly and understood we wanted a quick meal before our movie. 2 steaming bowels of noodles arrived in about 10mins. My Tantanmen arrived with its inviting reddish chilly oil floating on the surface. The menu does say bok choi, but ONE leaf??? The one slice of charshu pork was deli-ham-thin like everyone has mentioned. Broken cashews gave a nice crunch to the chilli pork mince that packed a nice punch of heat. The broth was tasty but don't let it get cold as you'll soon feel the pork fat start to coat your mouth.\nMy wife had the Tonkotsu Ramen which is her benchmark test of all ramen bars. The 20hr pork broth was seriously rich. Too heavy for my liking, but you can always order something else.\nI think I'm missing something here. This IS a noodle bar. And this is where it failed miserably. Hidden underneath all the nicely decorated and flavoured ingredients lay the pitiful existence of a small portion of ramen noodles. They had a strange floury taste, like eating a raw pancake. I don't think they were undercooked either since they were close to turning into a very post-al dente gloopy mess. \u00a311 will get you quality ingredients, but not a great serving of noodles.\nIts all most likely paying for a fancy burger but the only think to compliment is the lettuce and ketchup!"

When I get a bowl of ramen I expect the soup to be steaming hot. Unfortunately, the soup was just warm so marks off for that. The miso one had way too much miso which overpowered the chicken bone soup and made it too salty. \nLast but not least, we found the fried chicken was served raw and this was after we ate most of it.  After inspecting, manager was very apologetic and tried to blame it on the fact that they use corn-fed chicken which didn't make sense to me. However, the meal was on the house which was a nice gesture. Anything less and I would have given a one star review. We were very worried after the meal but thankfully didn't get food poisoning!

No. Because I'm an elite yelper, and that's what we do in this town. We give our two pennies (cents if you're Ameri-porean) worth even if it doesn't mean a darn.\nSo. Since I'm spectacularly late, I'm going to make up for it. \nGET THE C0CKSCRATCHINGS ON EVERYTHING!! \nYou'll thank me later.\nIf you've been following the tales of my exploits for noodles and swimming, you'll know that my professor friend and I go swimming once a week and we end up somewhere in Soho for noodles after. This time around, it was Bone Daddies turn. Besides knowing there was an elite event here, and having walked past and had one of the sexy waiters try to seductively lure me in (with good tasting noodles - and it certainly helped that the waiter was hotter than the broth they served here), I had to try the newest installment of gourmet ramen in my neighborhood.\nFor starters, try the BD Fruity or the Carrot and Ginger juice. Both excellent drinks on the menu. \nBoth professor and I were torn at what to choose on the menu. The good thing I guess is that they have all kinds of sides. So, if you want nori on the chicken ramen, or an extra egg in that soy ramen, you can add them in at a bit extra \u00a31 for an egg, \u00a30.20 for the nori. \nWe decided to go for the Ramen Salad (a ramen dish tossed in sesame sauce) and the Soy Ramen. Intrigued by cock-scratchings, we asked the friendly Aussie waitress about what they were. Apparently it's chicken skin/fat that's been fried to a crisp and sprinked on top of the noodles.\nNow, here's the tip... Cock-scratchings are not on the list of extras, but as mentioned above and I'll mention it again, GET THE C0CKSCRATCHINGS SIDE ON EVERYTHING. It's like the fat pipette. Indulgent, but you won't regret it. \nEverything was impeccable, and the sesame seed grinder was doubly a treat. 5*s would have been given if the broth was steamier.

However, the core of ramen is soup and i do think that it both missing something and exceeding something. \nAn idea of adding peanut into the soup was absolutely a disaster, its override the richest of the fat that the soup suppose to process, instead of the pork fat which was suppose to include in the soup, instead i think they are adding more oil which totally do not blend with the original soup they had, which resulting in oilyness taste which kills the other 3 elements which was great. \nThe price was ok, which is why i think they are using oil to reduce the production cost."

We got there and waited in a line for around 40 minutes, but it didn't feel too bad because we had expected this.  While we were part of the \"inside\" section of the line, we could order a couple of drinks which was great.  I was already a third of the way through my pint of Asahi by the time we sat down.  Having a drink also makes the waiting period pass more quickly.\nThe signature dish is the tonkatsu ramen (\u00a311), so we ordered one each.  It really is excellent: the creamy broth is packed with flavour and I liked the noodles and the eggs.  The pork was tender too, but I only got one piece in mine.  We also ordered sides of fried chicken (\u00a35) and softshell crab (\u00a38).  Both of these were nice, but the chicken was a bit dry.  The service was friendly and personable.\nI was happy with the experience, but it was on the expensive side.  This place won't suffer for that, given the high popularity it has at the moment.  I am pleased to have been here once to try the excellent ramen, but I would be leaning towards visiting one of the other good ramen restaurants where there is not such a long queue.

The hubs got his normal tonkatsu ramen. The broth was steaming hot and unctuous, but the pork a little chewy. Still, for someone as picky about his Japanese carbs, he deemed it a success. He was thrilled by the fact that they serve a bowl with two eggs, instead of just one (it's the little things, really). \nI tried the tantanmen ramen--a take on Sichuan dan dan noodles (often on the top of my cravings list). It was spectacular. The broth was a beautiful combination of spice and umami. Let's just say, I could eat that bowl of noodles every day. The burn builds substantially with each bite, and by the end my nose was a bit runny (a sign of an excellently hot dish in my book). We also tried the karaage (fried chicken), which was well fried, but the breading lacked a bit in flavour.\nTopped off with some ice cold Asahi, we were both impressed with this new spot in Soho. And while they say they're open late, I've yet to come across a noodle place open past Midnight. My little American gripe--Midnight is not late. I've barely just finished dinner by that point. Other than that, the space is large and open playing some of the best American rock from the 70s to the 90s. We sat at the counter facing the hipster cycle shop across the street, which (of course) meant brilliant people watching. \nAll in all, a new staple to our Asian restaurant repertoire."

We arrived early, at 12pm to ensure we wouldn't have to queue for a table and good thing we did. \nThe place isn't huge and we were seated at the bar type of seating, not really wanting to share with another party. For two of us we ordered the fried chicken starter and the salmon sashimi. Originally we had wanted the soft shell crab but due to their soft opening the night before they had sold out! The fried chicken was perfect, not overly oily and with a squeeze of lemon gave the perfect sharpness to accompany it. The salmon sashimi was fresh and came with a lovely light sauce on top with little crunchy balls on top (no idea what they were, but they were good).\nOf course we both had to order the 20hr pork ramen which came with bamboo shoots, an amazing egg which looks smoked and was just perfectly cooking with a runny yolk. The broth and noodles were both tasty and the egg was my favourite accompaniment. To drink I ordered the fresh carrot and ginger juice which was fine, nothing special but I expected what it said on the tin. \nWhen we got our bill we had been given a goodwill discount and only ended up paying \u00a326 for two of us for allll that food/drink. I assume this is because it was still during their soft opening period.

Atmosphere inside the restaurant is very London casual design, with the wood furnitures and cool lighting. Waiters and waitresses are also very friendly to talk to.\nRecommended.\nInteresting fact - the main chef is from Australia!"

It's a casual interior with high tables and chairs. We were a group of 4 so the corner tables work best, otherwise sitting in a row would have been too difficult to chat. \nThey had plastic Japanese smocks which I absolutely loved; I instantly put it on and kept it afterwards. \nFor appetisers the croquettes are must-have (I liked them better than the fried chicken). Never had anything so good outside of Italy! For ramen I went for the tonkotsu ramen. I appreciated that the serving was so big but I thought the ramen noodle itself was too thin, and the soup was a bit too thick, but it did taste good especially with the egg. Each table has a container of garlic, a garlic crusher, and a sesame vial, which all I definitely took advantage of. \nOverall I really enjoyed Bone Daddies: good setting, good food and good service!"

If you told me that my favorite lunch place in London would be a ramen shop, I could've (rightfully so) called you a maniac. This place pleasantly surprised me though. Whenever I went I always got Tonkotsu Ramen, since who needs anything else? One time my coworkers got some appetizers which were pretty good too but let's face it: you're here for the ramen. Having been to Japan and living in the bay area, I feel lucky to have tried so many good ramen places and Bone Daddies is up there--maybe even better than most in SF. The broth is excellent, the meat was cooked just right and the portion size is perfect for a quick but filling meal. The price for a bowl is a little expensive, but hey, it's London and luckily for me, I was reimbursed me for my meals.\nIf I'm ever back in town you know where I'll be for lunch."

I understand that there is an aesthetic and a brand to uphold but let me tell you this - whilst eating Ramen, I do not want to have Pearl Jam's \"Jeremy\" or \"Them Bones\" by Alice in Chains, or any other \"chin-rock\" classics piping out into my ears. Ive tolerated it each time but today I realised I could take no more when at approximately 7:25pm, my ears were assaulted by the Stone Temple pilots. In 2015 there is no excuse for this. I was in such fear that the next song was going to be \"Mmm Mmm Mmm\" by the Crash Test Dummies, that I had to rush the ramen down in light speed and get the fuck out of there as soon as possible. Quite a stressful experience, and as a result marks have been lost. Three stars, but could be so much more."

Their chicken bone broth is amazing. \nTop it off with bomb fried chicken & amazing cocktails and you have yourself an amazing place for dinner.\nMight not be the best place for a date as it is a little noisy but if you're looking for some delish Ramen and a cool spot to pop into for a bite - this is it!

How disappointing! The broth was very bland, it doesn't taste like the 20 hour pork broth it claims to be on the menu.  It's also covered with a lot of oil.  Just a reflection of what a long way we are from having authentically good ramen and an appreciation for proper ramen here.  The only good dish we had for the night was the pork bones, covered with a sweet sesame sauce, it was delicious but the portion is a bit on the small side.  Then we also had the black sesame soft icecream, which was ok but a bit too sweet.  They really should work on their broth.  Now that I  have gone to the holy trinity of ramen - bone daddies, shoryu and tonkotsu, i have to say tonkotsu is the most balance and has the best broth.  Still a long way to go London!\nI did notice at Bone Daddies that they provide you with rubber band to tie your hair up while you are working on your noodles, a nice touch!!"

We got there around 6:30PM knowing they don't take reservations. They were nice enough to take my word that my two friends were on our way and sat me down ahead on stools in the back.  That being said, I see the merits in waiting for the full party to be there as the two guys in front of me said they had a table for 10 and took up one of the coveted tables, only to have 6 in their party ultimately arrive - leaving us in the kind of awkward side by side seating in the back where it's a bit difficult to get your stuff together and have a dinner conversation. The staff, though, was quite friendly and accommodating even the small space.\nBut anywho, on to the food - \nThe starts \nAppetizer: Fried chicken: Delicious  - A must order. I wouldn't have even thought to order this at a Japanese restaurant but you won't be disappointed - it's perfectly crispy, comes with a squeeze of lemon and really hits the spot - perfect for sharing.\nYellowtail sashimi - Fresh and delicious - a nice compliment to the added fried chicken calories!\nI went for the Sweet 3 Miso Ramen and...eh. I mean, don't get me wrong it was good as Ramen - the broth was hearty and the noodles were right on but as toppings and meat go, I just needed more to offset the saltiness of the broth."

However, I went in for lunch today and ordered the Tantanmen 2, my favourite one, and then once I realised I couldn't finish this incredibly rich, chicken bone fat infused amazingness, I asked for a take-away box. I was then refused a take-away box. Here are the reasons why:\n(apparently)\n: there is no room for take away boxes (really?)\n: they would have to allocate another layer of operations to justify having a service to do take-away boxes (that doesn't really make sense, but okay)\n: it's wasteful of packaging, more so than actually chucking away half of a ramen bowl\n(despite having wooden chopsticks instead of reusable ones, but ok)\n: one can't control the experience of the ramen if it's boxed up and sent away with the customer who paid for it \nAnyway. All arbitrary reasons to me.  Look, if you want to have a new take on a non-native (aka the owner is not Japanese) in an international city like London, you make allowances like offer tupperware for those who would like to continue experiencing your delicious product. None of the reasons the owner presented as justifications for not offering a take-home option were air tight. The basic answer was, 'We just don't want to. And the customer can f*\u00a3$ off.' Fair enough.\nI never thought I'd say this, but I'm going to Tonkatsu next time."

Missed the savoury umami that's really important in any noodle soup. The noodles didn't hold their texture very well either. Soft shell crab was OK but nothing special.

The atmosphere in Bone Daddies is more hip than a typical ramen shop, but it's tightly packed. Which means there is a lot of rubbing of butts...not as bad as riding the JR Yamanote line in rush hour in Tokyo, but pretty close. Though, the communal seating and bar seating is good for dining out by yourself or if you come with friends. Well, good luck finding seats on a weekend night if you have friends. The place fills up fast. However, I was seated within a few minutes since I was by myself.\nI had the Tonkotsu ramen, and I have to say, I do prefer Shoryu's ramen...in egg, broth, noodles, the whole package. Bone Daddies is good, but I prefer Shoryu. Bone Daddies does have some fine, fine fried chicken (kara age).  Everyone around me was eating the soft-shelled crab, and seeming to enjoy it. And there were some cute waiters....just saying. All the waitstaff is really attentive and pretty fun.\nThe highlight of my outing was watching some chick curl up the ramen noodles with the chopsticks and the soup spoon like it was spaghetti. B****, please, that's not how you eat ramen!!! The hair ties on the table are so you can get you hair out of the way while you slurp it down! \nWell, in the end, glad I tried, but I prefer Shoryu's ramen, especially their egg. Price is similar, but I think Bone Daddies may be a few pounds more expensive. I wish I could put my finger on exactly why I prefer Shoryu, but I think it's worth trying both places for yourself."

The noodles were perfect, not too soft, with a certain amount of bite.  The eggs were extraordinary and the meat perfect.

The entrance is a bit hidden in the corner but once you locate the bouncer at the door, the location is easily given away.  We arrived at 8:30 on a Sunday night and the place was hopping. You have to make your way down a dark staircase to the Uber cool cavernous space which opens up to a giant multi-room restaurant with super high ceilings and very minimalist and tasteful decor. The bathrooms are so well hidden the panel doors look like part of the wall. They're very beautiful inside once you find them! \nWe made our way to the bar for a cocktail after we requested a table with side by side seating (which they were happy to accommodate with a modest wait). The bartender has apparently been with the hakkasan family for 8 years starting in Abu Dhabi and now taking up residence at the original london location. He informed us that despite the crowd we were seeing that evening that this was a particular quiet night and that the place is usually so packed that the wait at the bar can be quite long. We opted for the London only cocktails specifically the Tusan Fizz  and Mountain Peak. Watching the bar tender make these cocktails was like watching an artist at work.. and they were just as tasty as they were beautiful. \nWe decided to try the three style mushrooms and the London only spicy okra for our vegetarian dishes. We also ordered the spicy prawns. But the two stars without question were the crispy duck salad and the sweet and sour pork....omg...heaven on a plate. \nThe desserts at our neighboring table looked elaborate and yummy but we were so full. The service here was so wonderful. We chatted with several servers during the course of our meal and they were attentive, friendly and doting without being overbearing. \nWe loved this place so much we vowed to try the NYC location as soon as we return stateside. And we will be making our way there with very high expectations in just a few weeks! \nFrom what I understand the newer Mayfair location in London has parking and is busier than this one, but there's something about this venue that just oozes \"trendy\" and the mystique is just hard to replicate."

We decided our best bet was to order several small items and get a broader taste of what Hakkasan has to offer.\nWe went with the Supreme Dim Sum Platter, Crispy Duck Roll, Morel Mushroom and Vegetable Spring Roll, and the Jasmine Tea Smoked Organic Pork Ribs.  \nThe Supreme Dim Sum Platter is amazing.  The presentation was outstanding.  The platter came with eight dumplings total.  It consisted of two each of the following: gold leaf lychee and lobster, abalone and chicken shumai with caviar, Royal King Crab jade, and black truffle and Dover sole.  I wish I could do the taste of the these dumplings justice with my words but I just don't possess the vocabulary.  It was flat out absolutely delicious.  \nThe duck roll, spring roll, and pork ribs were also extremely tasty.  You can't go wrong with any of these orders.\nThe place is a bit loud so be prepared to speak up and have an amazing experience at Hakkasan!"

    "review": "So ok, this is probably the best dim sum you can get in London.  However, they are on the pricey side so be prepared to pay more than your normal cheaper dim sum place like Oriental or Royal China (best 2 cheap dim sums).  And their dim sum are served in odd number of 3 as oppossed to the normal 4.  Which also shows how pricey they are.  That's said, it is by far the best dim sum you can get in London.  Try not to go there for the normal Chinese food as they are just OK and they are cheaper elsewhere.  Just come for the dim sum on weekend and on Sunday, I believe they have the dim sum menu for brunch so only go for this if you want.  If you go on other weekday dinner, their dim sum is extremely limited and only for appetizer (unless they have changed this but I encourage you to check the time they will serve their extensive list of dim sum.  Cocktails here are great too as they have asian flavours in them."

    "review": "The only Michelin-starred restaurant we have been to in London has been Barrafina, but a year or two before they were actually rewarded a star (I know, so much foresight). So it seemed to me that not having eaten at one before we leave for good would be a mark on our soul, so I looked up...Yahuatcha...due to my own love for dimsum. But after perusing through their menu, I became unsure as to whether there would be a marked difference between the dimsum there vs the dimsum i might find at Jade Garden in Chinatown, aside from the prices and ambiance. \nAnd then I perused the menu at Hakkasan. And then I couldn't decide. And then I consulted my college roommate who's been Yahuatcha and didn't see a huge difference and i was still in indecision..until i found that Hakkasan has a tasting menu of  \u00a338 which included a cocktail, an app, main, and dessert (per person). It also came with rice and stir-fried asparagus during the main, which i did not expect.\nThis cheap tasting menu is only available before 6pm Sundays to Thursdays or something (can't remember the details) and not advertised in the restaurant. Although we specifically made a booking for that menu, when they seated us, they did not provide us with it and we had to ask for it in the dim dim underground lighting. The servers when we asked, also told us that we likely will not be full from the menu but we were undeterred.\nThe cocktails were so good. And the food was even better. I was really surprised because my expectations were really low - believing that Chinese food is just Chinese food, but they made it better! Rather than explosion stir-fried wok heat flavours, the food is more delicate and nuanced. \nAfter the dimsum platter, wasabi fried shrimp, duck, cod, and asparagus, the server was right, we were still hungry so we added some ribs from the a la cart menu. Holy the rib was the BEST. And then dessert was so good too. We walked away about \u00a3100 lighter in our bank account, but it was actually worth it. \nI'm looking forward to coming back again."

Took a while to get served for drinks but when we did they were very good.\nWe were then seated at our table. It's a busy, vibrant dining experience so don't come here for a quiet romantic dinner. It's cool though and I liked the vibe.\nTo start I had the veggie dim sum platter which was huge and very tasty. For my main I had the crispy fresh water prawn with dried chilli and cashew nut which was amazing. A mix of beautifully crispy prawns with whole dried chillis and nuts. Honestly loved it (as did my husband). \nHowever, our waitress was pretty terrible. She was rude and spoke limited english (I think she was eastern european) and not very accommodating. This may have just been bad luck but I was not impressed. I think partly this was because I was expecting michelin star service so maybe service is better at the mayfair branch.\nI would go back, despite the price, because the food is great."

The style of food is called \"Modern Chinese,\" and as that implies they take liberties with the classic style and present avant-garde dishes. I went with my granddaughter for their Sunday brunch and we both enjoyed a wonderful meal. One of our favorite dishes was the Crispy Duck Salad, but we also liked the Steamed Dim Sum Platter and the Fried and Baked Platter. The Jasmine Tea Smoked Organic Pork Ribs and the Grilled Chilean Sea Bass were also excellent.\nWe left very happy and well satisfied with the meal and the value as well.\nAny complaints? Well, to be completely honest, the service for us was merely 4 stars. No one waitperson took responsibility for our table and the appearances by various individuals were impersonal with rote presentations. Although the servers were rather pleasant and no doubt knowledgeable, we had no Asian servers and they seemed to be mostly Eastern European with heavy accents that were a bit difficult to understand."

A friend and I had a catch-up there after work to treat ourselves, and were given a wonderfully polite welcome from the start with no sign that we were there for last orders from the cheapo menu.\nThe only choice you need to make is meat, fish or veg - my mate and I went fish and meat respectively and shared which was perfect. We both enjoyed our Ling Ling Collins and a trio of dim sum to start - har gau classic, scallop and something yummy with chives. Her aubergine and shiitake salad then arrived but I think we were both more excited by my jasmine tea smoked organic pork ribs. I couldn't taste the tea per se but they tasted delicious with a good amount of meat on them. I liked the nice touch of slicing up the rack at the table and the way they kept it classy by serving them with finger bowls. My main was a generously sized spicy prawn dish, though this time I liked my mate's grilled seabass and honey better. We finished with a delectable trio of macarons in espresso, matcha green tea and passionfruit flavours which (unusually) I could barely finish.\nThe restaurant had gradually filled up around us and it was only on the walk to the toilets that I realised quite how big the place is. The low lighting keeps it feeling intimate while you're seated though, and combined with plenty of dark sexy decor and how beautifully the food is presented I think this would be a good date place. Go between 5.30-6.30pm or after 10pm for the set menu and you can impress them with your savvy bargain-hunting skills too!"

Hakkasan is a gorgeous space, the dark interior with well placed spot lights, delicate gold tapestry, plump noir pillows and pattern carved screens to section off the room and enhance the intimate feel.\nHakkasan is special. You should make an effort to go as its interior will certainly upstage you. Glam, classy and stylish is what you should go for as its a place to celebrate. Beautiful place, food, drink and people. With all this effort on the packaging, what does the content have in store? Well follow me on my birthday dinner journey and you will see. \nWe selected a \"Tast of Hakkasan\" menu for \u00a338 per person. It included a three course meal and cocktail. Value money if i do say so myself and as we roll on, it will become clear why. My cocktail of choice was the Lychee Martini which was absolutely delicious. No scrimping on the Vodka, you could taste the Belvedere. Sam Vanilla, my birthday host, had the Hakka, a mix of vodka, sake, lychee, lime, coconut and passion fruit. Cocktail are a thing at Hakkasan. For years I have heard how amazing they are and they were not a disappointment. \nAs we started our michelin star dining experience, it was a dims sum platter and crispy squid with avocado mustard dressing and caramilised walnut to start. The dim sum selection was a medley of colours and gorgeous ingredients. I tasted king prawn, shitake mushrooms and much more. A delicate devil of a starter! Sam Vanilla loved her subtly coated squid with the right balance between crispy and tender.\nWe settled on a meat feast for our mains with black truffle roasted duck and tea plant mushroom. Wow, truffle is my favourite so the aroma was very tempting. Unfortunately this was not my main choice, so i had to do with a cheeky little fork full of meat and pat the truffle filled air into my direction. I tried something a little different with the wok-fried lamb in a spicy mint sauce. I hit the jack pot too as the lamb was amazing. To describe the food is near impossible as it really is a food journey of loveliness. The sides comprised of baby crunchy asparagus and sticky rice. Again, no taking the eye off the ball, even for the accompaniments. I was truly delighted with this place as a birthday treat! A big thank you to Sam Vanilla, but also a big thank you to Hakkasan for standing the test of time.\nNow it was time for the dessert. Not being one to have a sweet tooth, it was a stab in the dark for me. I was delighted when my milk chocolate, hazelnut praline and rice krispies Jivara bomb arrived. There it was, the wee birthday candle and a message on my plate. Lovely. The bomb was heavenly. Sam Vanilla had the lemon and sesame tart with candied lemon and meringue. A picture of perfection and zest filled dream."

    "review": "I love this restaurant. I went there for my birthday about five years ago, and returned again recently for a special night out. Both times were exquisite experiences - and I use the word experiences, not meals, because this is exactly what separates a good from an outstanding restaurant: attention to detail and the crafting of a dining experience, rather than a focus solely on great food. It's rare that you find such an upscale, modern, sensual and trendy dining experience centered around traditional Cantonese food. Thank goodness they haven't taken the \"Asian fusion\" route (one that almost unfailingly results in quality reduction). \nThe restaurant is down a dark alleyway off Oxford Street. Think James Bond, sexy spy movies, understated luxury. You would assume you were gaining entry into a secret celebs-only club, not a Michelin-starred restaurant. Down the stairs you go, your interest piqued and your excitement growing. The entryway will not disappoint. The interior was designed by the set director of the film The Matrix, and it's stunning. The intricate woodwork, lighting, bustle, aromas, ambiance...all are intoxicating and immediately provide respite from the stressful streets of London. Beautiful people, beautiful food, beautiful bar. \nI remembered specifically the heavenly texture of the silver cod on the menu, so wanted to make sure we ordered it this time. Because of the tantalizing selections on the menu (lovely cocktail list too), we decided to go with a Signature Tasting Menu for 60 pounds per person. We got a dim sum sampler, some of the most flavorful smoked pork ribs I've ever had, and an array of entrees that lived up to my expectations (what a relief). The silver cod was just as perfectly cooked, tender, moist and slippery as I remembered it from the past. The Angus beef stir fry, vegetables and prawn dishes were also amazing. Service was flawless. My husband commented on how it was one of the best dinners he'd had in some time, and how surprising it was that this was Chinese food.....\nThe clientele here is a mixture of people celebrating special occasions and smartly dressed businessmen and women having work networking dinners. The dining room seems to maintain that perfect equilibrium of gregarious but intimate. It's alluring AND trendy. Not sure how the place manages to keep the balance going, but it works and it's a wonderful escape. \nIt's not cheap, but I highly recommend saving some money and time for an experience here if you can. Dress up, go balls to the wall, and have some fun."

The other dim sum were decent, but nothing really stood out and one amazing piece of dim sum doesn't qualify the entire platter.\nThe chicken corn soup was also not impressive, I have had better at Good Earth. It tasted mostly of chicken and not much else.\nThe pepper rib eye beef was really good though and had a lovely peppery aftertaste. I really enjoyed the tender pieces of beef and the yummy sauce they were in. The deep fried prawns were a bit too sweet for me, but my husband really liked them.  We also ordered Hakka noodles, which were thin noodles with great texture but very little flavour at all. They would be great to mix with a spicy sauce-y dish, but on their own they are pretty bland.\nI was excited about the Michelin starred food and although everything was good, nothing really blew me away. It was like going to a good concert but with only low volume music. Perhaps if I had ordered more in a big group I might have been more impressed. The restaurant itself was nice, stylishly dim, but nothing special.\nI have heard that the service is iffy, but our server was nice enough, although I was a bit worried that she was a robot sometimes. They even sent us a plate with happy anniversary written in chocolate and a scoop of lovely sorbet with graham cracker-y goodness, and we really appreciated the thoughtfulness.

I'm super overdue in writing this as we came here last August and the menu has changed a bit. But it was the most perfect, delicious and relaxing lunch I've ever had. I can still remember it as if it was yesterday!\nBesides the food I think a major draw of this place is the atmosphere. The restaurant is hidden away on a tiny side street and when you descend the dark stairs into a wide black-walled yet well lit room it feels very exclusive. The staff are very friendly and polite though I imagine more so when you have a reservation and know exactly what you're doing than if you just happen to wander in. Nevertheless we were well taken care of. We got a nice corner seat with a great view of the whole restaurant. And even though it started to fill up by the end of our meal, we had a sense of privacy the whole time.\nI don't think my descriptions of our dim sum would do the food justice so I'll just say this; it was outstanding. Seriously one of the best meals of my whole life. I can't even decide which course was my favourite. Between the cocktails, the appetizers and main meal, to the desserts and the tea I was a huge fan of everything. And it was so beautiful! Nothing I enjoy more than food that is not only delicious but aesthetically pleasing as well. \nAs far as I know this is one of many Hakkasan restaurants around the world. Now that I'm back in LA I can't wait to try the one here. I admit this is not a restaurant you go to when you're not a budget. But it's nice to splurge every once in a while.

We found a \u00a335 Taste of Hakkasan menu, which includes 3 courses and a cocktail - not a bad offer! \nWhen arriving at the 'original' London Hakkasan off of Tottenham Court Road you go down a dark stairway, past the blue lit reception area, into a dark and moodily lit space with the bar at the back.\nAfter a first cocktail at the bar we were shown to our table, they kinda squashed us in, but it was a nice round table.\nWe had Dim Sum and Crispy Duck Rolls for starters, then a choice of either Roasted Silver Cod, Pipa Duck (more crispy duck - I can't get enough of it!) or Stir Fry Black Pepper Rib Eye.\nDesserts were selected from the full main menu - I can recommend the chocolate one!\nSo what's the verdict? \nThe food looked & tasted amazing too, I was only uncertain about the sauce with the Roast Silver Cod, but that wasn't my dish!. Unfortunately the dinner was let down by the service. With a Michellin starred restaurant I expect a certain level, certainly not what we received.\nNot only did we get told that the Taste menu wasn't for those that were hungry - a suggestion that we literally were not going to get enough food, but also the impression that we were being looked down on for choosing this option - staff repeatedly walked into me when serving or clearing the table (it's not that dark in there surely?!) and food didn't arrive at the table at the same time.\nI can't excuse any of these issues when I've been to similar caliber restaurants (Roux at the Landau and Maze) on similar deals and been treated superbly, so this is something that Hakkasan should work on for all levels of client - not just those dropping \u00a3700 for dinner for two (true story, but it wasn't me!).\nAnd the staff member was wrong - we had plenty of food and left feeling stuffed, especially after a pot of tea, post dessert."

We were ushered into a cramped corridor of a bar, where aside from not being able to hear ourselves speak, we were unable to get to the bar as it was so crowded. The disappointing thing was that the bar was full of dissatisfied customers waiting overly long on their tables. Our 9 o clock table came at 9.40, after a huge amount of pestering of the overworked staff. \nThe table we were given was so near the DJ that we couldn't hear, and the table was so dark we couldn't see. Typically, a second after opening the menu, a waiter impatiently asked if we has chosen, and we told him that with our senses so deeply inhibited, it was fairly difficult to discern your a** from your elbow, let alone chose food. In the end we left the restaurant without eating, as the place had the all the charm and character of a reversing dump truck with no tires on. \nIt was a typical restaurant that was greedy- and overbooked hugely, and tried to be too cool. One doesn't go to one of the most expensive Chinese restaurants in the world to listen to repetitive and shoddy music from a low end DJ- in fact a DJ has little place in a restaurant at all.

Having been awarded a Michelin star, Hakkasan does seem self-indulgent with bouncers at the door, service that opens the door for you, takes your coat and bags away from you and is there at your beck and call. All this and yet the entrance looks like it is the entrance to a seedy nightclub, the decor within is dark and simple as if to hide the fact that they couldn't be bothered to inject some vibrant colour into the place and the seating is not only not that comfortable but the tables a quite close together so it is easy to see the food the people next to you are eating.\nNevertheless, the food and drinks are inoffensive and packed with a good variety of ingredients that you may never have tried before, the staff are well trained, and when they cook a chilli dish they don't hold back."

The other aspect that we immediately noticed was the abundance of service staff; it felt more like a hotel check-in rather than a restaurant.  Suppose that's what you should expect form somewhere with a Michelin star!\nAmbiance was dark wood everywhere, but lighting helped with that and set a nice mood.  The star of the show for me was the black truffle roasted duck, which was bursting with rich flavor.  It's not going to hit the spot if you're looking for a sweet taste, but rather the savoury flavour hits you right away.  The sweet and sour pork was also prepared well and was a good price compared to most of the other dishes on the menu (though probably not going to beat your local takeaway).  It gave us pause like 'What's the catch...', but no ill effects to speak of to date.\nDefinitely an occasion restaurant as it's quite pricey, but the service and quality of food seemed worthy of a Michelin star."

The style is nearly identical, consisting in wooden surfaces, glass panes and coloured lights; a cocktail bar, a low-lighting and intimate ambient with some music playing in the background.\nThis is probably one of the most popular restaurants within its category. In fact, people need to book their table some days in advanced since there is always a lot of people and it is very unlikely to ind a table without having a reservation.\nSome of the dishes I suggest the most are the Crispy duck rolls and the Dim sum platter which are two of my favourite plates and I always get them when I go here.\nIf you like Chinese cuisine I strongly suggest you to check this out and maybe also let me know what you think about it. If you are more into Japanese food, there's also that! Always a part of the Hakkasan group, it is called Sake no Hana.\nThis is a review taken from my Travel blog which can be found here: \ngoo.gl/kvy5Oi"

    "review": "This is essentially overpriced Asian food off Tottenham Court Road. I've been to both branches of Hakkasan in London and this is pales in comparison to Hakksan Mayfair in terms of service, food quality and also general decor. Even walking to HHP feels a little eerie given it's at the end of a dark side street. Unfortunately, the inside also suffers from the same poor lighting.\nThis is based on two different experiences from around two years ago as well as one last year (for the sake of clarity) and there are some good dishes on the menu but I've always felt underwhelmed and hungry when leaving. The drinks are average and truthfully, the first time I visited the waitress pretty much turned up her nose at two of my friends who are strict Jains and do not drink. For a Michelin starred Chinese restaurant this is disappointing both in terms of food and service. I live in Hong Kong now and have been to many other dim sum restaurants in London and although some of the dim sum on the weekend menu at Hakkasan are creative they do not justify the price tag in my opinion. The ambience at the other branch is much nicer and I've had better experiences with staff as well as enjoyed the food a little more. A quick tip - don't bring your own birthday cake unless you plan on also ordering dessert here, you will be charged a cake cutting fee per person."

Fun, fruity cocktails and mocktails accompany the courses.  A few modern twists on traditional dim sum that keeps your palette guessing.  All of the waitresses are dressed in the same boldly colored dresses and perform with the demeanor of automatons."

    "review": "This was an amazing experience. From walking down the two flights of stairs to sitting down in the dimly lit but chicly decorated restaurant, it was a very complete experience. \nI ordered the vegetarian dim sum, which was probably some of the best, most flavorful dim sum I've ever had. There were 4 different types of dim sum in the bamboo container, and 2 of each type. For 11 pounds, this was a great value! It came out steaming hot, with a great texture. I think it had fake meat, vegetables and sauces, and the dim sum came with both soy sauce and spicy chile sauce. I definitely recommend this dish! If you're not too hungry, you can definitely order it as the main dish and split a side of rice.\nThere were 4 of us, and we shared a bowl of fried rice. This was only 5 pounds, and each person got a full bowl. I also tried my friend's vegetarian spicy black bean chicken and beans. This was delicious as well, and super flavorful. \nWe finished with 1 dessert split between the 4 of us. We ordered the Javindra Dessert (or something like that), which is an ice cream chocolate mousse ball coated with a crispy layer and covered in dark chocolate, which they pour after setting it down on the table. It also has pop rocks on the side!\nAll in all, definitely coming back here!"

    "review": "Food - 4.5 stars however all other ratings considerations drove my rating lower. So here's the scoop:\nFood: wow - excellent meal.  I started with the vegetarian hot and sour soup. It was probably the best I have had - lots of flavor and no flavorless dollops of tofu. I had the Three Style Mushroom Stir fry. Normally, I would not select a mushroom only dish although I am a huge fungus fan - largely because I usually find the dishes to be uninteresting but I was intrigued given other menu selections and the restaurant's reputation. It was a good decision - the mushrooms were amazingly flavorful with just the right sauce. My date selected the dim sun option as an appetizer and the stir fry peking duck. Both were very good. Ordering brown rice as an accompaniment must not be common as instead of a substitution for white rice, I got a huge bowl of it and it cost an additional 8 pounds. \nAnd here was the downside:\nService: ...was uneven, and not just a little uneven. We had good service at the bar where service was efficient. I was especially impressed with the well chilled glass in which my date's vodka martini was delivered - perfect!  However service went downhill once we were seated. We dined downstairs. It appeared that the waitstaff was assigned to a section and our waitress was challenged with keeping up with orchestrating the meal. She would disappear for a while and appear at times when we weren't ready. The addition of a second person to take our drink order was poorly coordinated and he did not seem to be very interested in his job nor in our requests. He wasn't interested in explaining the wine list; he plunked our drinks down as if he couldn't wait to leave. We waited an inordinate amount of time to get our bill as well. \nIn addition, the wine list was terrible! It wasn't organized by varietal nor region, nor even flavor profiles. Instead, it was a weird mix of selections under topics such as \"Classics: Fine Wines with History\" (most wines have history and nobody offered to provide the history nor was it explained in the list), \"Vielles Vignes: old vines\" (NOT all French and old vines is an undefined designation) and \"Purity: the expression of the fruit\" (huh?!). I love my wine and I love to peruse a good wine list.  The Hakkasan wine list was just painful and its organization made it impossible to make a selection.  It was so poorly organized that we gave up on finding something and ordered cocktails.\nPrices were really high. I could chalk this up to it being London and London prices but the prices were over the top.\nBefore leaving, I stopped at the bathroom and met another American while washing my hands.  We looked at each other and almost simultaneously said \"Weird\"."

    "review": "This review is for the sunday dim sum menu.\nStarted off with an excellent gin based cocktail. They sat us down and explained the menu to us. The first course was a crispy duck salad. This was amazing how the flavor of the duck and the crispness came together in your mouth. I wish they had brought more. \nThen came out 8 different dim sum dumplings in all. Generally typical (prawn Pork etc) but what stood out to me was the venison. However I wish I had used more pepper sauce on these. \nNext was our appetizer course- since we ha four people we ordered both the squid and the vegetable. Both were crispy. \nI should mentioned that during the meal we had champagne being poured for us the whole time. Not fancy bottles but still very tasty. Went well with meal. \nFinally the mains came and we were getting full. But alas we enjoyed the Seabass and the lamb. The Seabass was a bit fishy tasting (it is fish) but seared well. The lamb was tender but needed more flavor. The fried rice wasn't special but the Bol Chou was good. \nAfter this feast we thought we were finished. But alas after a brief period of rest came dessert. The rest of the table ordered the chocolate sphere thing which crackled in your mouth. Really good with the chocolate sauce poured over it. I however went or the macaroons. Always tasty. Did I mention we also got a dessert cocktail? I got a whiskey one which was quite a nice ending and I thought went well with the macaroons. \nAll in all a great value for Michelin star food. It took all afternoon an was a great opportunity to spend time with friends. Some of the flavor a could have been stronger. Lastly wish it wasn't in the basement but I think it's part of the desired atmosphere"

We felt they wanted us out as soon as possible. This is what ruined it for me. Management should have a look at that. But why really, when all table are taken always. \nThe food: I ask myself how they received a Michelin star! \nI had the Dim Sum platter and Green tea smoked chicken. What comes, is the bare chicken. Rice and vegetables need to be ordered seperately. Which feels like a joke to me. \nThe food tasted good. That`s it! Seriously my lunch-chinese in Hamburg offers the same taste for 10 EUR. And I make the same morning glory at home. No special twist, no interesting aroma, no nothing.\nThe noise level is overwhelming. \nThis was so ridiculous.\nHow can all these people think that this is the best food they ever had? This is a mystery to me. \nI admit, the interior is spectacular. And that was worth seeing. But that was the only thing that I didnt fall into depression when leaving. \nIt was so not worth it. Sadly it was my birthday. We should have gone to Muriels Kitchen across from the Ampersand Hotel instead. And would have had a fab time.\nThink twice before you come here.

The interior paves way for a relaxed atmosphere with clever use of lighting and partitioning to give you that private and exclusive dining experience.\nWe ordered a selection of dishes from throughout the menu, sharing and discussing amongst us in the traditional Chinese way of eating. The vegetarian and meat dim sum platters were generous enough with the prawn dim sum offering an amazing mix of texture and a fresh prawn flavour. In addition the stick tea ribs were amazing and again came in an ample portion. \nFor mains, we ploughed through a variety of dishes including vegetarian (of which there is a great selection) and unanimously came to a decision that the sea bream with champagne and honey sauce was utterly memorable. \nFor desert I would most definitely recommend the chocolate bomb and a nice selection of macaroons. \nOverall, I would highly recommend this place as an dining experience that can see you lost from the outside world for a number of hours whilst you enjoy the many wonderful flavours of Asian cuisine."

    "review": "Based on the cheaper \u00a335 taste of Hakkasan menu, this place isn't bad.  Considering a cocktail is over \u00a310 and you get one, plus dim sum, a main and a dessert the deal is pretty good. \nIt's kind of classy in a 90s kind of way, it's dark and modern but at the same time it feels a bit bit dated for some reason.  Service was good and the atmosphere was good, food was ok. \nComparing it to the best Chinese, the dim sum was a nice modern twist in terms of flavour but the steamed dim sum's pastry was too thick and floury, and the balance of the filling in the duck spring roll wasn't quite right.  \nThe beef in Merlot sauce was very good with great aromatics, the pippa duck was probably sitting on the pass too long as the skin wasn't that crispy and the cod with champagne and honey sauce was awful.  The cod dish smacked of something to put on the menu to try and elevate the place, why ruin the delicate flavour of fish with such a sickly sauce?  In true Chinese cooking sugar and sweeteners are used as seasoning to bring out natural sweetness not make the dish sweet.  The cod aside it was a pleasant meal (though I wonder why we were offered garlic chilli paste as a chilli dipping sauce) and good value.  The ambience of the place suits a venue to impress because of the all round adequacies but there are better tasting Chinese plates around London."

The first could be your cynical side, observing Hakkasan is basic dim sum and chinese fare prepared exquisitely well.  Could I reconstruct the tastes at 1/5 of the price in LA via an afternoon crawl across the San Gabriel Valley?  Of course.\nBut, much like people, there is something to be said about a restaurant that knows what it wants to be, and has a personality to back it up.  Huge diversity, perfect drinks, and good service make it an easy recommend.\nI have learned very few lessons in life other than the most essential (Always bet on black, never fight a land war in Asia) but a 3rd Hakkasan has confirmed is 'When confronted by Ostrich on a menu...order every damn time\".  It never fails, their version is an amazing balance of heat, sweet, and saltiness over rice."

It's tucked away in a subterranean space on a small side street, but once you get inside, it's overwhelming for the senses, with ultramodern d\u00e9cor and a loud, lively lounge atmosphere. \nI tried a number of plates, including the dim sum platter, the stir-fry black pepper beef, and the sweet and sour pork. All were of reasonably high quality and presented gorgeously, if a bit small in size. The drinks were exceptionally strong. Even though I spread out 2 cocktails over 6 shared plates, I still stumbled dizzily up the steps and onto the street as we left later that evening. \nI hate being a party pooper, but it wasn't necessarily the best Chinese I've had - and I'm of Chinese descent to begin with. It was simply very good. I guess stylish d\u00e9cor, attention to detail, and reasonable food quality is all it takes to dress up otherwise conventional Chinese food into a Michelin star and command a truly spectacular price premium.\nIn the end, I enjoyed the overall experience, although I must stress that I'm by no means a high-maintenance person when it comes to being \"impressed.\" ;) All in all, if you're ready to pay a pretty penny, then it's not a bad choice for a special night out or to celebrate with friends."

The menu is fantastic.  Probably twenty, twenty-five dishes I wish I could of ordered.  The problem was there definitely was inconsistency.  Some food was wow, this is what I expect from a top London restaurants.  Others were weaker than what you would get at a local Chinese restaurant.  Started with the Dim Sum platter, which was interesting, but flavor and complexity did not stand up to the top Dim Sum around Leicester Square.  The appetizers that jumped out were duck rolls (spring rolls filled with duck) and the ribs, which had a great caramelized exterior.  Both of those clearly five stars.\nI was with four other people so we were able to sample multiple entrees.  I had Pipa Duck, effectively peking duck without the pancakes.  It was perfectly prepared and everyone who tried it loved it.  Also stand out was a black beef dish.  On the other hand sweet and sour berkshire pork had no more flavor or complexity than I would expect in an airport and was left half eaten).  Dessert was also good but not memorable.\nService was definitely five stars, friendly, attentive, but not overpowering.

Accordingly, we booked Hakkasan for lunch and its sibling, Yauatcha, for dinner.\nI didn't know much about Hakkasan, but man, were we pleasantly surprised.\nOk, first things first, this is definitely toned-down Chinese. But it's classy toned-down Chinese, and if you just embrace the fact that you're eating upscale fusion food, you'll be fine.\nThe d\u00e9cor is really pleasant: it's sort of a cheeky take on a traditional tea house, with cut wood dividers and little dabs of tat. It's dimly lit and just modern enough, without being so chic that you feel alienated. There's a DJ spinning pleasant background mood music right in the centre of the central wing (there are three, and I believe a few private rooms), and a full bar.\nDrinks: really good, balanced, and as described in the menu.\nFood: solid, and set at an appropriate price point for quality/quantity. But don't get the pumpkin tofu; it was a massive disappointment.\nService: spotty, but not for wont of trying. The place was packed, there were lion dancers weaving in and out, and you got the distinct impression that it wasn't normally this chaotic. There were two slips in the service (the wrong drink, and the aforementioned tofu arrived around the time we were ordering dessert) but the staff were trained to the calibre you'd expect for this level of establishment, polite, unobtrusive, smiley. Great overall.\nAs a bonus, the dessert here wasn't an afterthought, and the tea menu was delightful. I have a soft spot for places which actually brew my tea well and yes, Hakkasan, you did just that.\nI do wish that the flavour profiles stuck a bit closer to their roots, and that's the only reason Hakkasan misses out on its 5th star. Aside from one fried nibble with dried scallop inside, and some very very mild preserved duck egg in another, I found things just a bit lacking in the flavour department overall."

It's definitely a hot scene so be sure to dress the part!\nUsually places like Hakkasan are more about the vibe and B-list celebrity spotting than the food, however, that is so not the case here. I went to Hakkasan last month for a friend's birthday. We had an elaborate tasting menu, which annoyingly had to be vegetarian, but was still quite the feast. \nOne tip, if you do the vegetarian tasting menu---some fake meats are clearly better than others. The black pepper vegetarian chicken and surprisingly the fake pork (or what tasted like vegetarian pork) were divine. I never had such tasty vegetarian food, seriously and I've been to Saf! The fake shrimp on the other hand had a less desirable gelatin texture though the sauce was great for my rice.\nFor drinks, the cocktail and sake menu is extensive. There is a fantastic and slightly eclectic range of house martinis---get the cucumber saketini. \nThis isn't a proper review unless I also describe the toilets, and specifically the tiny woman who guards the door to the facilities. She is as diminutive as the door is massive. I'm still not sure how she can sense when you have left the toilets and how she musters the strength to open the insanely heavy door. Bizarre comment, I know, but check it out yourself! Everyone who went to the toilets commented about the WC attendant.\nIn summary, if you are in the mood for some tasty and very very scene-y Chinese look no further than Hakkasan."

The restaurant is located in a sort-of alleyway hidden somewhere behind Tottenham Court Road which was a little difficult to find at first. \nWhen we got there, there was the scent of joss-sticks which is nostalgic of the wrong sort. It reminded me of Chinese temples or the altar room I had back in my home. Having this scent permeate a Michelin-starred restaurant was quite odd and the dark and dim lighting reminded me of the time when I visited Abercrombie and Fitch sans the loud music.\nGood service was expected of a Michelin-starred restaurant, so at first impression they were doing OK, then I started finding flaws later on. Our coats were collected before we were seated but before we were even sat, my friend noted that one of the waiters gave her and us a once-over. How rude! I know we weren't dressed up posh but it's not like we came from the slums either. Nevertheless, his attitude was quite off-putting. \nChoices of dimsum were severely limited. Despite this, the food that we ordered were good and well made. We enjoyed the standard selection of har gau, siu mai, etc. but it was quite disappointing that we were made to share when the dishes came in either 3 or 4 pieces per dish. The waiter could've told us this when we ordered or made exceptions so all of us could happily have one each. Perhaps I am expecting too much but 13% for service (0.5% more than the standard 12.5%)??\nOverall, the food was good but the service was meh. I expected more out of a posh restaurant because that's one of the key points (besides the food) that sets it apart from the normal non-starred ones. \nHonestly, for the service, I can get better elsewhere. (even normal-posh Chinese restaurants overseas have way better service... with better lighting as well)."

While a meal here does come with a hefty price tag, I felt like it was somewhat justified by the quality of our experience."

    "review": "It was difficult for me and my husband to justify paying as much as we did for Chinese food, when we are so used to getting the real deal in Chicago's Chinatown (and for free from our friends back in Detroit) for the past five or so years. However, the innovative cocktails menu, the high quality of the ingredients in the dishes and the posh vibe made up for some of this hesitation.\nWe were pleased to see not only the long list of options for drinks but also very unique combinations of flavors, so we ended up splurging by ordering two each and sipping on each other's.\nMy husband, fellow Yelper Eliter Michal, has an obsession for cocktails with egg white. The U.S. mostly shies away from using it except with the New Orleans Ramos Gin Fizz. However, at Hakkasan there were at least four or five options that had egg white. He got one with a \"jasmine egg white foam\" that had pomegranate. Afterward, he went with a whiskey drink for contrast - \"Smoky Negroni.\" \nI got a not-too sweet but very zippy martini called the Thea and was happy to see it was mixed with one of our fav Polish vodkas (Michal grew up in Poland!) - a hard-to-get bison grass variety. With a blend of sharp ginger, slighty sweet yet tart apple and lime juices, this drink was smooth yet strong. My second was a very refreshing Kumquat Mojito, a fruit I rarely see and never with mint and rum. I'm grateful for our server's suggestions!\nNow for a quick run-down on what we ate: We decided to forego the preset menu because all the dishes looked too familiar yet too expensive to us. Instead, we opted to do family-style sharing/tapas-style with all appetizers (in order of what we liked best to least).\n*Crispy duck salad- Props to our server for suggesting this, as it was our fav dish of the night. Duck has always been my fav protein and Chinese preparation (usually Peking BBQ) is my jam. I enjoyed these tiny fried morsels mixed with bright microgreens, which was just the perfect fresh complement to this decadent meat.\n*Soft shell crab - amazingly tasty with right amount of crispies and seasoning, devoured quickly with hit of spice from red chili flake and curry leaf\n*Turbot soup with mushroom (AKA wild fungus and goji berry) - flavorful broth with wild mushrooms not used to seeing.\n*Fried aubergine (eggplant) and mushroom - surprised at how crispy yet light these were! A bit larger of a portion than needed though.\n*Dim Sum Platter of shumai and dumplings (one with lobster, another with caviar/scallop/shrimp, another with crab and chives) - seems overpriced until you consider the filling but this one was not worth it to me because I'd rather just eat the filling if I'm paying that much.\nFor dessert, I was excited to see calamansi as that lime-like fruit reminds me of Filipino food, so we got the calamansi and chocolate ganache. It wasn't too sweet with the perfect balance of tart and rich, but it also was not too heavy or big to end the night.\nUltimately, go for drinks and a few apps to share for a special night out that won't break the bank (too much)."

    "review": "I was secretly hoping to go to Hakkasan for a meal, so I while we were shopping at MUJI nearby I dragged hubby in here for a light dinner.  This is one of my all time favorite restaurants in London and I recommend Hakkasan to anyone who asks.\nSuper classy sexy place.  I liked the idea of the \"list\" and bouncer upstairs at the entrance.  Gives a feeling of exclusivity.  Of course we didn't have reservations  :-(.  But they just called down and it was no problem.  And they didn't seem fazed by the fact that we weren't dressed up at all (jeans, boots) and were loaded down with shopping bags.  When we got down the stairs they were expecting us, and took our jackets and seated us right away.  I liked the service was snappy.  \nAlthough Hakkasan can be expensive, it doesn't have to be.  I might have mentioned this in my initial review but the dishes range from under \u00a320 to over \u00a330.  And there's plenty of choice throughout the entire price range.  Since we weren't that hungry we ordered the shanghai dumplings, dimsum platter and mapo tofu.  They also have an extensive cocktail menu.  Though not cheap at \u00a310 each, they are incredibly good.  Real cocktails, not just cosmopolitans.\nThe shanghai dumplings were good but not as good as I've had living in SF.  I remember the dimsum platter being amazing, and while still good I think I've had more experience with high end dimsum.  I still think it's the best I've ever had but the comparison gap wasn't as large.  The map tofu was made with beef and it was amazing.  We were already full after the 2 starters but just couldn't stop eating the the tofu!  \nTotal meal was less than \u00a350 for 2 starters, main, cocktail and tip.\nFunny story about their obsession (good) with appearances, when tipping for the coat check we noticed that the dish had 3 pound coins arranged in it.  We added one more and received our coats to put on.  When we turn around they've removed one of the coins so there are only 3 again.  Only someone obsessed with design and aesthetics would ask the staff to do it."

    "review": "Just returned from this restaurant.  This is a fun upscale place with mostly quite good Chinese food.  Close to 200 pounds for a rather light meal for 3.  We ordered drinks and food.  Was slightly taken aback when soup and appetizers arrived before our cocktails--but didn't think much of till our mains arrived before the rest of the appetizers and grew cold before we got to them. The dim sum plate was above average and very pretty to look at. The taste was good, but no where near as good as you'd find at a place catering to a primarily Chinese clientele.  The reviewer who said the har gau were the best ever has probably not eaten many. The cocktails were quite sweet even tho the waitress had told us they weren't.  The duck salad was very good;  the sweet and sour Berkshire pork was so-so: the pork not crispy an the accompaniment heavy on the onions with a few bell peppers.\nWhen we finished they offered us dessert.  We chose some tea and while we were drinking it, we were asked to vacate the table-another party was waiting for it and there was a 2 hour limit!  So that was the reason for the slapdash service--they wanted to turn our table.  When I complained to the manager he said this was a policy of the restaurant, that we had been informed of when making the reservation (I didn't make so perhaps) and that we'd been called to remind us of that (an absolute lie).  The crucial point is that at no point when in premises were we informed of this and we were offered tea and dessert when we didn't have time to drink it.  Also,  I couldn't help but notice that many of the people seated near us had been there when we arrived and didn't seem to be under a curfew.  The manager did English Officiousness very well; giving a sh-t, not well at all.  As much as I enjoyed the classy, fun atmosphere and some of the food,  I would never go back.  Food 3.5.  Atmosphere 5.  Management 0."

I was never left wanting for anything, the staff was incredibly knowledgeable about every menu item, and plates were brought in and taken away in a completely unobtrusive manner. These people are professionals of the upmost degree, and hats off to them.\nThe food was excellent. We shared some 4 small plates and entrees, plus a noodle dish and some excellent vegetables. I'd say the highlights for me were the small plates, particularly the salt and pepper squid and the dim sum platter (i'm looking at you little scallop and prawn wrap of tastiness) Unfortunately, it was still Chinese, and despite spending some $400 American on a meal, we were still hungry a few hours later and ended up at a Burger King. \nI can't say i'd come back unless I was once again invited as a guest,  as this place is definitely WAY out of my price range. Still, I feel incredibly fortunate to have had a chance to experience this meal."

Was it that someone's job was to just open the bathroom door?

If you offer your help with the menu, I'd expect that you, well help. We began with salt and pepper squid and the dim sum sampler. The dim sum was the better of the two. My wife had the sea bass for her main and I had the Mongolian stir fry venison. I liked the venison a lot, but wish it had more veggies. They also do not have brown rice and they don't even include rice with your mains, which seems really nickel and dime. Good thing the food was great. Call that a 4 and the service a 2. On the plus side there is an impressive bourbon selection that included options you can't find in the states, Maker's black label anyone?"

    "review": "This review is for the dim sum.\nBest kept Dim Sum secret.  Cost?  Pretty much the same range as any other dim sum place in London...a small premium.  Quality?  10x better than any other dim sum place in London.  What's that you say?  You thought Hakkasan was for the filthy rich?  Not authentic enough?  Wrong \nI admit that I had my doubts.  A look at their dinner menu posted outside made me scream a little in my head.... tricked into another overpriced Chinese restaurant in London.  Puh.  Well, that may be the case for the dinner menu, but the dim sum menu is very reasonably priced.  For two people, the cost came out to be the same as Royal China except everything about the Hakkasan dim sum experience outshone any other dim sum place I've been to in London (and we were stuffed for the rest of the day).  So let's talk about the food.\nThe menu is a combination of traditional dim sum plates and a few plates with a unique spin.  We had a go with both types, and were pleasantly surprised with all.  Generally speaking, every dish was good and very well executed both in taste and texture.  However, four things really stood out to me:\n1.  Chang Fen with Beef Flank - I can't recommend this dish enough.  My boyfriend nearly devoured the whole thing, and I was trying to fight him for it.  Hakkasan have taken a little spin on the original Chang Fen idea, and topped off the Chang Fen with...well, basically a version of Cantonese Beef Stew.  Who would have thought to put the two together?  The Chang Fen itself is phenomenal.  PERFECT texture----slippery and soft, but firm enough to not break apart when you pick it up with chopsticks (No other dim sum place around London has seemed to master the texture of Chang Fen.... most of the time, it's overly soft).\n2.  Shanghai dumplings - do not get this.  It is basically just pot stickers.  I thought it would be real Shanghai dumplings, which is one of my favourite dim sum plates.  Remember that Shanghai dumplings should always be steamed, filled only with meat (NO VEGGIES), and so juicy that when you first bite into it, you get burnt by the hot juice splattering across your chin.  If a Shanghai dumpling does meet these requirements, then it is not a true Shanghai dumpling.\n3.  The dessert menu had White fungus & pear soup.  Surprise!!  Don't be put off by the white fungus description!  This soup brings back home for me as my mother used to make it in the summer time.  You can drink it cold (the way I like it) or hot, and it's just a really smooth, not overly sweet, dessert to have at the end of a meal.\n4.  Tea.  I probably drink more than a litre of tea a day if I'm at home.  And all Chinese teas I stock up on from trips to China.  Hakkasan actually have a fairly good tea menu with some pretty traditional teas that you don't normally find in other Chinese restaurants.  Pu-er cha for instance and Tie Guan Yin (which we had, and was very good!!!).  \nI am definitely coming back here.  I am not even sure I would give any other dim sum place in London a chance again.  It's worth the tiny 5 pound premium.  The quality of the food is just amazing, and really under-priced in London terms."

    "review": "Dim sum is one thing that can be done very well for reasonably cheap, so I entered Hakkasan's luxurious space afraid we would be shelling out for the chic flower arrangements, the lush seating, and the seductive ambience.  My fears found themselves unfounded - yes, Hakkasan presented its food with impressive, elegant trappings, but these were just a gorgeous frame worthy of presenting the attractive and phenomenally delicious dim sum.\nI'm going to get two brief complaints out of the way first.  1.  No pictures allowed, and that's company policy.  2.  Our waitress seemed a bit impatient at first, as we were first-timers who didn't necessarily know how much to order or how this new-fangled cartless dim sum worked.  She answered our questions, but seemed a little surly about it.  She did warm up to us quickly, though, and service was generally unproblematic and even friendly at times.\nNow, the food.  We were presented with a la carte and dim sum menus, and went all dim sum, with one order of vegetarian dim sum from the a la carte menu.  We started with this vegetarian dim sum platter, which came with two pieces each of crystal dumpling, vegetable shumai, yam bean and shiitake dumpling, and vegetable beancurd roll.  We proceeded with the steamed king crab noodle wrap, the chinese chive dumpling with prawn and crabmeat, the seafood dumpling consomme, the scallop shumai with tobiko caviar, the char sui bun, and an order of the Singapore vermicelli with prawn and squid.\nEach dim sum order came in its own little bamboo container or ceramic bowl, and everything looked beautiful - dumpling skins in deep honeydew green, glistening scallop topped with jewel-like tobiko, burgundy pork peeking out of white clouds bursting quietly at the seams...the presentation was a cut above any dim sum I'd ever seen before.\nIncredibly, it tasted even better.  Every last bit of dim sum was cooked gently to unveil bold flavors and toothsome textures.  The dumpling skins were impossibly good, the consomme soothing and deeply aromatic, the Singapore noodles fluffy and wonderful laced with firm bits of seafood.  Not one bite fell short of eye-opening, and Hakkasan unlocked a new level of dim sum in my culinary universe.\n \nWe should have stopped there, but curiosity got the better of us and we tried the tapioca pearl pudding, which came with little snatches of vanilla panna cotta, poached banana, passion fruit sorbet, and caramel popcorn.  I prefer the humbler version of this dessert offered at lower-end dim sum places.  This one tried too hard and the result was a messy hodge-podge of clashing and cluttering flavors.  The rest of the meal was so delightful that I'm going to forget this final bit ever happened.\nHakkasan was a revelation.  In one meal - and a lunch, at that - I obtained a new lens by which to judge dim sum.  My experience wasn't perfect, but the core of it was, and it is upsetting that I can't go back and repeat it any time soon.\nAlso, the bathrooms are REALLY COOL."

I absolutely loved their food so it only seemed logical during my recent my week-end in London to have dinner at one of their London locations which, in my case, happened to be the Hanway Place one.\nUpon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised with the fact that the restaurant was almost identical to its sister location in Miami for the setting there is absolutely stunning. I had their Dim-Sum platter which were tender and perfect.\nThe Dim-Sum platter tenderness was matched by their Wagyu beef which was a delicacy that I really enjoyed.\nAll in all, I had a very good dinner although I hated the fact that I felt we were being rushed out after the main course as our waiter told us that our table had to be cleared for their next customers and that since we had gotten there ten minutes late, they could not allow us to have dessert. I, then, argued that hadn't they had directed us to the bar and left us there for a good 25 minutes after our arrival, we wouldn't have had to order dessert so late. Finally, the restaurant manager \"agreed\" to let us order dessert which we did.\nAll in all, I had a great experience food wise but the aforementioned \"dessert incident\" is the kind of things that can absolutely spoil an otherwise perfect dinner. I understand that this restaurant seems to be always full but how can anyone in their right mind tell their customers they can't order dessert?\nOne last detail: as this restaurant is located beneath ground level, there is no cellular signal whatsoever anywhere inside.\nOne last detail: as this restaurant is located beneath ground level, there is no cellular signal whatsoever anywhere inside."

    "review": "I was on a business trip to London in late March/early April that coincided with my 30th birthday.  My ex-pat cousins invited a couple friends and fashioned a nice, little, away from home, celebratory gathering for me at Hakkasan.\nI'm not quite sure how my cousin found Hakkasan (She'd been once before, I think).  It's nestled in a corner down a handful of streets to tiny that in NYC (where I'm from), we'd call them alleys.  From the outside, you can tell it's perilously hip.  The clues are the lighting (yes, even from outside) and the bouncer-type folks at the door.\nWe were greeted once inside and invited to the bar for a drink while waiting for our reservation/table that was almost ready.  There's a coat check right there (always appreciated in the London weather).  The interior is darkly lit (but menus and such are still clearly visible), larger than one would ever expect (and very well populated), and still quite hip.\nThe bar service was quick and efficient and my prosecco was quite tasty.  Only a few minutes later, our table was ready and we moved with our drinks to sit.\nThe menu is quite extensive.  And with our party of six, we used it as an excuse to try a LOT.  We had 5-6 appetizers, 5-6 entrees, a couple of bottles of sake, and 6 desserts shared around the table (OK, the desserts were a little less shared because certain people had become territorial over their sugar by that point).  It's now July so I won't attempt adequate descriptions on so many dishes months later.  However, I remember some truly succulent duck (I LOVE properly cooked duck) as well as a host of other dishes that were creative and all nicely balanced-spice-wise.\nOur waiter was attentive and had plenty of answers and suggestions when we asked for his thoughts on the menu (always a good thing).  He was present without being overbearing and a delight.  And one of our party members accidentally dropped a glass, breaking it.  The staff acted as if it was no trouble at all and it was cleaned up and replaced faster than one could blink.\nMy dessert was presented with a \"Happy Birthday\" beautifully written in cursive in chocolate on my place.\nMy only real qualm with Hakkasan is that they asked us to put our camera away.  I hadn't planned on snapping over and over throughout the meal (Those people annoy me too), but I did want a few shots since it was such a monumental birthday.  I guess that would disturb the hip vibe.\nHakkasan seems expensive, but I am American and everything in London does.  Was the price of the same number in USD as opposed to GBP, I wouldn't bat an eye.  However, I was treated...and even if I wasn't, I am happy to pay for good food on nice occasions.  Perhaps I will have another on a future London trip."

    "review": "Taking a sophisticated Chinese friend from Hong Kong for lunch in London is always tricky as the standard of the home city is so unbelievably high, and so it proved on this occasion when she expressed herself impressed with the decor, but found the food not as good as in Hong Hong and the whole place a bit pretentious. In truth, it's not a place for lunch, though they do a pretty good dim sum, as it's decorated and lit like a nightclub and the menu prices make no concession to the time of day, unlike other Michelin-starred restaurants such as L'Atelier Joel Robuchon where you can have a prix fixe at lunchtime for \u00a319.\n The staff too are somewhat snooty - as has been noted elsewhere, and our waiter was both a touch surly and distinctly unhelpful when we wanted to make more room on the rather too small (for a Chinese meal) table for two. The pretentiousness came out again when he saw me taking a photo of the dim sum and was positively 'British Airways steward' in trying to suggest that I was in the wrong. I quite understand restaurants don't want people flashing their cameras at other diners, but discreet no-flash photos of your own food is fine and I refuse to be brow-beaten. As a consequence, I took more than usual of the decor.(also apparently banned).\n The crispy squid was good and well seasoned and the seafood soup delicious - it tasted almost as good as the fabled sharks-fin rice that one is sometimes given in private company restaurants in Beijing and which costs an Emperor's ransom, and the roast chicken and stir-fried lotus root was excellent too. Though not quite good enough for seasoned Hong Kong tastebuds.\n We only drank tea (of which there was a fine selection) so we avoided the mark-ups on the wines which have made others wince, but we emerged in to the light with a pretty big hole in our wallet for a lunchtime meal and some tiresome service\n A final point; I am now unimpressed with restaurants and pubs which don't provide free wi-fi - and extremely unimpressed it's not available in a basement like Hakkasan, as one can't pick up 3G either."

As for mains, spicy beef was great, the prawns were really good, lobster with black beans was excellent and the pork dish also good.\n We also had the crab, which looked good as it came in the shell with all the claws, but it was actually annoying and time consuming to get the crab out of the shell, and not really worth the effort, particularly as we were with clients so had to try to not make too much of a mess (although the sauce ended up all over my shirt anyway).\n Dessert was good, its nice to be able to have something other than lychees or banana fritters in a Chinese restaurant"

    "review": "Went here on the last night of my trip in Europe because my dad (who lives in London) said its his favorite restaurant. Now.. obviously I'm from California, so going to a high end \"asian\" restaurant in England made me skeptical from the get-go.\nThe first thing that ticked me off about this place is the fact that we had to have our reservation checked not only once but TWICE by the stuck up snobs that worked there (once at the door and once again when we got inside). Yeah, I know a family does not fit the profile of young and wannabe rich, but that shouldn't warrant attitude from restaurant staff of what's supposedly high end (this is not a damn club). We're going here for the supposed good food, not to act like douches and stare at everyone else in the restaurant. This ain't Hollywood.. so the B.S. shouldn't even be a factor here.\nSecondly, they sat us all the way in furthest corner of the restaurant in the furthest place from other guests as humanly possible. I thought I had escaped the L.A. pretentiousness by going across the pond but I guess its even worse here even when they don't have any celebrities to cater to. \nLastly, nothing we ordered was bad.. but NOTHING was what I would consider good - AT ALL. All the deserts were mediocre too. The only thing that lived up to my expectations was the service; but it should be a given in a place like this. \nThe only points I'm giving are for the service and for the decor/ambiance because both were very nice. Looks wise this restaurant does rival nice spots in Los Angeles so its a good place to 'impress' someone I guess. \nGiven the ridiculously bad attitude from the staff and the fact that the food did not impress me at all, I would definitely have to say there's no way I would ever go back. But I can see the appeal for most people."

Finally i waved a guy down who admitted to being our waiter. He didn't say much just nodded a lot.  We ordered a \u00a3150 bottle of sake. That and the appetizers were wonderful. The entrees arrived and they were delicious. I gave four stars only because i felt the staff was stuffy and stand offish. The waiter broke a glass on our table and never said a word. To his credit he shook my hand when we left but i am sure that was for the 13% service charge he tacked on."

    "review": "Needless to say, there's a lot of \"fuss\" going around about Hakkasan, mostly being all positive. I think it's really important to undertsand that this is not your regular Michelin star restaurant. No silver service, pretentious service....far from it. You're even seated on time limit which for me personally means no Michelin star but I don't make the rules. The decor and interior is fantastic, nice traditional asian touch with modern brasserie style buzz. However, the food is a slight let-down. Let's remind ourselves again that this is supposed to be Michelin star class. Salt and pepper squid was the highlight but the rest was above average, but ceratinly below what you would expect at such an establishment. Hakkasan is absolutely an overall good experience for all the senses but the tastebuds are left the least entertained."

Jordan. And The King of Jordan\"\nHaha, what a perfect double-celebrity sighting! I had to go.\nBut sadly for me there was no celebrity sighting just boring nobodies around me, I wonder if the people sitting on the tables near me thought the same of me. Pah. Of course not... they'd be honoured to be sitting near Tom E off of Yelp.\nSo with no celeb sightings what else would Hakkasan offer? Well, the dark chocolate feel of the comfortable deep tones and wood made it certainly feel chic, modern but also perfectly functional inside. Kudos to Alan Yau once more for his skill in design. The service was impeccable as expected and the salt and pepper fried squid was beyond superb. I can still taste it in my dreams.\nBut for the price (high as a Hong Kong block of flats), other dishes were just not on par. Specifically I'm thinking of...\n1. The dumplings... good but not orgasmic, and\n2. Mapo Tofu - a limp excuse for 4 times the normal price of my all-time fave chinese dish.\n[sad face with tear coming out of one eye]\nStill, it was a great experience I'd love to try again but not until I've been to little sister Yauatcha about a million more times.

I didn't see any celebrities (though my British celebrity knowledge isn't that great) but this is definitely somewhere you can expect to see a sighting. A guest list lady is at the door, don't even think of walking up without a reservation (unless by chance you are a celebrity reading this awesome Yelp review) and I hear that tables often need to be booked quite well in advance. The ambiance and decor is trendy and reminds me of the upmarket restaurants that are adjoined to Las Vegas nightclubs. The food was good but tbh not as spectacular as you'd think given the high price - I think you are very much paying for the wealthy and fashionable vibe rather than the quality of the food. If you want to impress your significant other with a trendy night on the town this is a good place to start or if you're a tourist consider this as a good example of a fashionable London restaurant."

    "review": "Hakkasan - Pics at The London Foodie\n(\nthelondonfoodie.co.uk\n )\n I have a love-hate relationship with Hakkasan  there are so many things to admire about this place but also so much I dislike. Over the years, I have returned many times to Hakkasan, and on every visit I found that what I loved most about this place - the food - had been consistently good. My last visit was no exception.\n Much has been said about French designer Christian Liaigre's multi million pound interior, Hakkasan's Michelin Star rating in 2003, and its listing in S. Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2008, so I will not go over old ground.\n Despite the occasional snooty service, and the extortionate prices for their teas I keep going back. I love the d\u00e9cor, and unlike many, I do not feel that the restaurant lighting is excessively dark - I find it soothing and feel that it adds to the overall experience at Hakkasan.\n I was pleasantly surprised to find I was able to book a table at 12:30pm for dim sum when I called on that same Saturday morning. Dr G and I headed to the familiar spot on Hanway Place, and were soon seated. We ordered a pot of Orchid Pao Chung tea @ \u00a34.30 and a selection of eight dim sum dishes. These were:\n Scallop shumai with tobiko caviar @ \u00a35.20  the scallops tasted fresh, and were within the finest skin I have encountered. The tobiko caviar added a sophisticated look and a pleasant saltiness/crunchiness to the delicate scallops.\n Braised beef brisket with cheung fun @ \u00a34.80  this was also delicious although I was expecting to have beef brisket cheung fun not with cheung fun (my mistake!). The meat was braised to perfection in a deliciously sweet broth with hints of cinnamon and star anise. It was lovely to be able to finish off this delicious sauce with the added cheung fun.\n Crispy smoked duck and pumpkin puff @ \u00a34.80  I loved both the presentation and flavours of this dish. The combination of pumpkin and duck was perfect and made for a good alternative to the more usual prawn & pork combo.\n Sticky rice in lotus leaf with wind dried pork and salted duck egg yolk @ \u00a34.50 this was also a delicious dish with plenty of salted duck egg and pork filling in a thin case of sticky rice.\n Pan fried turnip cake with garlic and Chinese chive @ 5.50  the cake had a lovely texture, was crispy on the outside with a delicious flavor of fried chives and garlic. This was one of the highlights.\n Steamed corn-fed chicken bun with abalone and crabmeat @ \u00a34.50  the combination of the different meats was surprisingly good within a light and delicious pastry.\n Steamed crabmeat siew long bun @ \u00a36.00  Hakkasan's take on xiao long bao or Shanghai dumplings was as expected excellent, with plenty of soup and a thin, delicate skin.\n Sweet black sesame ball @ \u00a33.30  stunning presentation and a light, fragile outer casing containing a generous amount of rich, sweet and nutty black sesame paste. This was a fantastic dessert and one I will make sure to order on my next visit.\n I apologize for the poor quality of the pictures. Hakkasan is renowned for not allowing any photography, and I was politely asked by management to stop taking pictures.\n Cost: \u00a352 for two, or \u00a326 per person including 13% (!) service charge. This is nearly twice as much as I would normally pay in most dim sum eateries in London.\n Likes: Excellent quality dishes beautifully presented, ultra fresh ingredients, stunningly designed restaurant.\n Dislikes: Efficient but impersonal service, no refilling of tea pot, and no photography allowed.\n Verdict: Hakkasan is one of those restaurants many would love to hate. I love it. I am still surprised by the amount of hostility this place attracts but in my opinion, despite the ridiculously high prices and the impersonal service, the food is fantastic and I will certainly be going back for more."

The guys in black suits on the door, the squadrons of pretty waitresses, the ambience inside, and the people-watching. Get a seat facing the room or you're missing the point. \nFor really authentic dim sum, go to Royal China or Top of the Town. But those won't be full of media bunnies in tight suits and short dresses, and you'll go home alone...\nIf you can't get a table, try Yauatcha, which is equally sceney and has arguably better food."

If you feel like splurging on a stylish night out, then this is a great choice. \nYou have someone greeting you at the door of this sleek hideaway. You have someone take your coat and yet another person check your reservation and guide you in. I'm surprised they didn't have someone forking the food into your mouth. \nI've found it tough to find a quality, creative cocktail in London - Hakkasan is clearly trying to make up for this and they do a good job. They also have a stellar wine list. \nThe menu can be overwhelming. It's also shocking to see main entrees for \u00a3150 or more. I'm not kidding. It's nuts. \nMy friend and I decided to split a bunch of starters including the dim sum platter (yummy), ribs (amazing), lamb salad (meat was too dry, I wouldn't pick this again), mushroom and water chesnut with lettuce (mediocre), soft shell crab (big yum). \nThe waiter was average and didn't do a good job of advising us on how much to order and what makes a good combo, nor did she have any wine suggestions. For a place of this calibre, you'd expect the waiters to be pros. \nBut in the end, it was all about the experience. It felt like being in a sleek spa, with scrumptious cocktails, original and memorable food and  WAY too expensive. I guess you're paying for them to have fifty people waiting around to show you to the bathroom and to keep up the gorgeous space..."

It is located on a quiet road, and on entering you walk down some stairs into a basement, its dark and romantic, with the decor mixed with modern and oriental influence.\n \nMenu is Chinese cuisine but more gourmets with some interesting flavours fused together which comes up with interesting tastes. \nI love my deserts, but dont tend to go for them in the Oriental restaurants, but on my recent trip here, I had a a pineapple cannelloni, which I never heard of, it was brilliant, but on the small side, I just wish there was more of it.\nThis is somewhere I would recommend you take your partner for a romantic meal, it's got a lovely, romantic setting and it's a great way if you want to impress somebody. However it comes with a price tag, drinks are relatively highly priced, and so is the food, expect to spend roughly \u00a3150 for starters mains and drinks for two, i have never spent less than that in here!! \nHowever, its definitely worth it for a nice treat.

    "review": "At the entrance of Hakkasan you are met with two bouncer-esque characters who check your name on the reservation list. I'm not sure what their purpose is because there is a bar down stairs where you can wait for a table to become free when you don't have a reservation and also, when you reach the bottom of the stairs, you are once again asked for your reservation details anyway.\n The impact of Hakkasan is immediate - it is dark, yet shiny, with spot lighting on each of the tables and otherwise night-club lighting. The otherwise cavernous room is split into more intimate areas by large wooden poles which may or may not have been bamboo poles painted black. Its supposed to be a very modern take on the Chinese motiff. Unfortunately no photos allowed!\n The Hakkasan drinks menu was very impressive and contained a good balance of non-alcoholic and alcoholic cocktails not to mention a staggering wine list. When you check out some of the offerings its no wonder that people can easily spend hundreds, or even thousands, on one dinner here!\n The food menu was also fairly impressive, with diverse and sometimes unique offerings, but surprisingly nothing shouted EAT ME which is terribly unusual for me not to mention the fact that the prices were outrageous if not unexpected.\n To my surprise there was nothing on the dessert menu that we were interested in, even if we could fit more food into our very full bellies. Instead we opted for a second round of non-alcholic cocktails - very yummy.\n Overall Hakkasan is definitely a place to be experienced at least once but my recommendation would be to save it for a special occasion though if you're minted, well, I guess you could make it an everyday experience!"

Service was prompt without being too in your face. We ordered both a starter and main with some vegetables and all of it was totally delicious.

I think sonot sure it does take away though, which is a shame as the food is really excellent.\n There is a great variety on the menu for both food and drink and both are really very good and its worth going along just to try out the cocktails. You certainly used to be able to go and just bar fly which was a (relatively) cheap way to check out the venue and have a very nice drink. Not sure if you still can as I haven't been in a few months.\n Great atmosphere in the darkened basement with some very subtle lighting and some great understated but cool decor, and although it's big the lighting and set up means it holds onto a feeling of intimacy for either a date or a business meeting where you don't want the information to be available to all and sundry. The low lighting gives it a bit of a feeling of a new york restaurant for me.\n Anyway it's well worth a visit and its open late as well for all those night owls amongst us. Be warned though - I've only been phoned about possibly fraudulent spending on my credit card twiceonce was in Tokyo after buying two things in 5 minutes in a shop.and the other was after going out for dinner here. Cheap it is not."

It's not an aphrodisiac but it sure puts you in a good state of being... all that without the Yoga exercises. The price for the dining experience.... mmmm...bite my head but I did nor find it that bad. Less classy joints have cost me more even with vast amounts of alcohol I ordered. This place is my current favourite in London."

Lighting was particularly bad on the table; we could not even read our menu properly.\n The food is great but not superb considering the amount that we paid. The roast duck with caviar was \u00a3150! The total bill came to about \u00a31000 for eight of us. The service was fantastic but I can't help but wonder if it was because we were spending so much. I heard from friends that they were really stringent with the 2 hour slot that you get when you book the tables. However, we booked the table for 8.30pm and we stayed for the entire evening till about 12 midnight!\n On the whole, I would say that this is a restaurant with good food and designer interior. However, it is not a place that warrants all the talking and all the hype."

And it doesn't disappoint: A trendy, dark lit setting, with comfortable seating, plus good food and service.\n Starting off, we ordered dim sum (prawn har gau anyone?), which was good, but not spectacular. For mains, among the dishes we ordered included the roast chicken in satay sauce (which was good) and the sauteed roast duck (which was brilliant).\n The friends I took were non-alcoholic, so we abstained from the strong selection of wines and cocktails (though there were non-alcoholic cocktails). The only obvious downside is the price."

So don't get hung up on the posers, cos you're going to miss enjoying some of the best asian food in london.\n I love the setting - a subterranean dining space, accessed from a dingy alley off Tottenham Court Road. Hardly a salubrious neighbourhood, but it heightens the effect of entering such a trendy space. Dark, moodily lit, black ash furniture is all counterpointed with the occasional spot & neon blue lamp. The bar area boasts some comfortable sofas & an impressive drinks menu.\n Once you're seated service is attentive, especially as you start to realise that the restaurant holds a lot of covers. To be honest the food is well executed but there are no signature dishes. Unsurprisingly its expensive, but not overly so."

The place was packed with people. The fact that i was alone must have helped (why don't i have a friend in London who likes chinese food ? boo hoo).\nI start with a crab meat starter. Tastes good ... a bit like calamari ... but nothing too special. But the main course was very good (i am proud of my choice). Mongolian venison ... soft, and very well cooked meat. It was lovely. Had it with the egg fried rice, which was rich and tasty. Is it my imagination, or was the light (rather, the lack of it) playing tricks on my eyes ? It seemed to me that they cook the fried rice only with egg yolks ... it was all yellow ... and did i mention that it was rich and tasty ?\nThe bowl contained a lot of rice, as the sweet lady serving me had warned. When she came to clear the table, she said \"wow !!! you ate all the rice !!!\". I spent exactly 6.2832 seconds trying to decide whether to feel proud or embarrassed. But i was too full to do much thinking.\nI would have finished there and then. But those evil people going on around serving food and clearing the plates ... one of them sweet talked me into asking for the dessert menu. Can't give Hakkasan credit for the glorious sweet red sparkling wine that i ordered (didn't even know these things existed) ... but full credit to them for the sweet talk though :)\nOne star less because the place was too loud. I doubt if one can have a decent conversation here.\nP.S: There were a group of arabs in a table nearby. Their glasses were being continuously refilled with wine without them even asking. If this can happen in a michelin starred restaurant, my boss has nothing to worry :)"

When I won the prize it said meal to the value of \u00a3200 so I thought I'd have trouble spending that amount, but the reality was that it was all too easy! A reasonable meal for two plus a bottle of wine took us over the \u00a3200 in the blink of an eye so this is somewhere to come if you have more money than you know what to do with, or if someone else is paying.\n Hakassan is in a maze of alleys behind Tottenham Court Road tube station and screams trendy from the Mitchell-brother-like bouncers on the door to the slate walls on the way down the stairs to the underground restaurant.\n The food was absolutely wonderful - the dish I enjoyed most was Mongolian stir-fried beef which was truly melt in the mouth. You also get the entertainment of watching the beautiful people - it's like a different world to the one I usually inhabit.\n Only downside was that the restaurant seems to limit diners to 2-hour sittings. The couple on the table next to me ordered more drinks after their meal and were cross-examined by the waitress about how long they were likely to take to drink them!\n Definitely worth a visit if you're feeling flush, but only if you can eat quickly!"

My friend and I decided to use our hotel $$ savings from the Hoxton's \u00a31 Sale to splash out at London's first Michelin starred Chinese restaurant. Huge mistake and we knew it the minute we walked in to face a row of sullen Robert Palmer 'Addicted To Love' zomboids. \nThe people of Hakkasan appear to be the most irritated species on the planet. Not only do they begrudgingly take coats and hold open loo doors, they also forcefully remind you (for the tenth time since making the reservation two months ago) that you absolutely must be finished with your table after 90 minutes, no exceptions. (And a hearty hello to you, too, oh irritated ones!) But it doesn't stop there. If you can open the menus without assaulting your closely situated neighbors, you are then tasked with divining the ingredients in the title sans descriptions dishes. We saw three duck dishes and made the mistake of asking our ill-humored waiter how each was prepared. Instead of waxing rhapsodic on the virtues of each, he snapped, \"They're all duck, that's all you need to know.\" Hmmmph! It went further south from there, but at least it was consistent -- consistently awful to the point of hilarity. \nSpare yourself the scorn and scolding, unless of course, you're into that kind of thing."

Just off Tottenham Court Road, down a back alley, tucked away in the corner, set in an old underground carpark. Keep going towards the end of the street and you'll eventually find the exclusive entrance.\n Plunge into the bowels, down a set of sleek and very dark stairs and suddenly a wonderland will open up to you. This would be the perfect place to bring a first date you're keen to impress. The tables are discrete, the lighting moody and beautiful people waft around looking cool - although you will find the odd rowdy group of Chinese businessmen.\n Incense hangs in the air and you can just about take a sneaky peak into the buzzy kitchen.\n The menu is huge and pretty overwhelming. The tea-smoked ribs are a favourite, the jasmine rice served in a dainty bamboo basket. The pepper beef is also delicious.\n Service can be a little hit or miss for a restaurant of this caliber. But the food makes up for it."

Trying the cocktails is a must while you wait for your table (particularly the lychee one!) and sitting at the bar in the buzzy yet chilled atmosphere is a great experience. Although the design of the restaurant is quite closely packed in the screens, darkness and low lights give the restaurant an intimate feel, perfect for any romantic dinner.\n Already knowing that the owner Alan Yau owns Wagamamas and another michelin star restaurant Yauatcha I was expecting the standard of food to be very high and I was not disappointed. The waitresses are constantly there for any need you might have but are not intrusive and at no point in the meal did we feel rushed.\n The menu contents is quite overwhelming and the dishes that have to be ordered 24 hours in advance (such as sharks fin and beluga caviar) make an interesting read. My starter and dessert (soft shell crab and chocolate and passionfruit ice-cream) was delicious, however my beef main unfortuantely tasted like standard chinese fare saying that though the rest of my party all had fantastic dishes.\n Hakkasans was a very enjoyable experience however it comes at a very steep price but it is to be recommended."

I was pleasantly surprised from the moment we pulled up into the small back lane entrance and walked downstairs into a fabulous underground lair. The decor was beautiful asian-style and contemporary plus the place was packed with a great, upbeat ambiance. The food surpassed my expectations - it was adventurous chinese mixing a nice balance of authentic flavours with new flair. Served family style, it made for a great group meal and I kept eating long after I should have put the chopsticks down. Not to mention the delish lychee cocktails which were more creative than the usual lychee martinis you'll find at so many asian fusion spots. Only downshot, cocktails were a bit slow to be offered and then delivered to the table and after our allotted dining timeslot,  we were politely but firmly asked to leave rather than enjoy another drink. Understand this is a reality for hot tables in London, NY etc but I prefer a subtle request versus the pointed ushering towards the door. \nAll said, I would absolutely return!"

No less than four members of staff showed us to our table in relay. A maze of passages guide you through corridors of latticework walls through which you can glimpse the faces of other diners and see the winking glint of spotlights and reflections as you walk along. Take a trip to the loo and you'll encounter a member of staff whose sole responsibility to guide gents into the mens ladies into the womens.\n At the table the service was efficient and the food arrived quickly. The starters are on the large side and more appropriate for sharing. I had the soft shell crab which was delicious. For the main I went the whole hog and ordered the grilled Wagyu beef. This was my first Wagyu experience; the meat was tender and succulent, easily the finest steak I've ever had. The steak was served sliced and arranged on two banana leaves that were formed into the shape of a boat. Bamboo shoots stood in as oars; the oar blades were slices of fresh chilli. My two friends ordered scallops and lobster and I sampled them both. Although the scallop and lobster meat itself was excellent, the sauces were a little bland which made the dishes seemed a little lackluster.\n It's a pity that the menu seems a little hit and miss as the surroundings are magical and the service was excellent. I'd come here again but would be careful about what I ordered."

One's name is checked off on a list by a doorman; a back slate-lined stairway leads down to an incensed-perfumed reception hall and the restaurant. The decor is mostly black with backlit blue walls. Laser-beam spots punctuate the gloom, and geometric Chinese screens divide the tables. It manages to reference an art-deco Shanghai opium den while being very modern, luxurious and comfortable.\n Waiting for Liz at the bar, I had something called a Purple Emperor: a wonderfully smooth, but actually yellow mix (a base of rum and sake). The purple was supplied by a massive orchid the bartender popped on top for decoration\n My preconception was that a Michelin-starred trendy restaurant would offer small portions: however the opposite was very much the case, with every dish seemingly sized for two hungry eaters. A starter of Sechuan chili crab was enormous and completely fabulous; my dimsum selection was pretty good too and contained 8 large dimsum. My main of jasmine tea smoked chicken was amazing (but must have contained at least half a chicken). Liz had another massive pile  of ribs this time. Side orders were a very generous plate of pak choi and and a canister of steamed rice. Neither of us actually fancied the rice but our waiter insisted.\n He was a funny one  all the staff were charming and friendly except our waiter, who was quite aloof and dismissive and really couldn't be bothered to answer questions (all the staff are very beautiful  the restaurant could double as a modeling agency).\nWe got complete fireworks when we asked for a doggy bag for the large quantities of leftovers. We don't do takeaway! We don't do takeaway! our waiter insisted emotionally, as if the very suggestion was mortally insulting. OK, this is a very smart restaurant and obviously they want to distance themselves from fast-food joints: point taken (and obviously, Hakkasan is a world away from a takeaway). But there were HUGE amounts of leftovers of very delicious food I was loath to leave behind. However, I am completely averse to making a fuss in restaurants. Not so Liz, who made them very aware that on this occasion they would be doing a doggy bag! So, eventually, I climbed the stairs out clutching my precious hamper of leftovers (much admired by an American tourist). Even our waiter seemed to find the funny side at last."

What are they going to do? Tell us to spit out the last bit of food in our mouth and show us the bill? Made the reservations anyway, because one of my friends told me that the Hakkasan is a must. And he was right! To begin with the tight schedule: I don't know how, but we never had the feeling that we had to rush. It was very crowded, but we still enjoyed our privacy. The Asian food was very high-level. We were a party of 5 and the waiter recommended us to all choose something different for starters and main course and share. That worked out fine. It gives the whole evening (oh no, 2 hours) a very communicative and cosy touch. The service was very good anyway: very accurate, not at all obtrusive and very friendly. And somehow they really know how to get you out after 2 hours, without being pushed.\n Prices are fairly high, but for us tourists in London it was a one-time experience that I would not want to have missed out on. The combination of the perfect food, the one-time atmosphere with floral arrangements, without daylight (the restaurant is in a basement) and a very nice combination of hip and stylish elements without forgetting the need for cosiness, makes it to this one-time experience. Although, not that one-time I hope: I will definitely visit this restaurant again!

If you get dropped off of Oxford St., walk down Hanway Place and when it forks stay to the left. Go all the way down and the restaurant will be on the left at the end. Go down the flight of stairs and be greeted by a bouncer. \nThe inside of the restaurant is all trendy asianed up. It is actually huge downstairs. I came here for dim sum.  All the items were a modern version of the traditional dim sum (no chicken feet here :( . The best dishes to order are xiao loan bao (I don't know the english name, but if the server doesn't understand you they are steamed pork dumplings that come with the ginger and vinegar sauce on the side). *Also when eating these dumplings, you need to let the soup inside drain out before you put it in your mouth or you will burn your tongue.* I'm not really sure what I ordered, I just asked the waiter for the most popular dishes. Here is what I didn't like: chicken soup and duck egg rolls. The pan fried chicken and shrimp dumplings were okay. I had this sea bass something dish that was interesting and would have been better if there was more sauce. If I go back I would probably skip the dim sum and go straight to their main dishes.\nOkay, again with the desserts in London. Amazing! I don't know what my friends dessert was called, but it was soooo good. It was shapped like flan, but was more like ice cream and came with something similar to peanut brittle on the side. It seems like every place I try, the desserts get better and better. I decided to go the healthy route and ordered an exotic fruit platter (warning its huge!)

I can only guess it is no coincidence that the papers announced the next day that it is the most expensive restaurant, per minute of dining, in London. Uncanny. Hakkasan seems to be one of those places  you'll either love it or you'll hate it. I'm firmly in the love camp. Soaring ceIlings, dim lighting and dramatic, dark wooden decor reminded me of Buddakan in New York. Unlike in New York, where great grub and a spectacular setting often go hand in hand, it's so rare in London for such a fabulous fit out not to mean the food is complete rubbish. I have heard rumours of too cool for school service and door bouncers  there's NOTHING I hate more. Although they're glamorous with some gorgeous kit for uniforms (I'd wear those blue dresses on a night out) we found service at all times to be efficient, but quite friendly and helpful. I suppose the area when you first walk and face the line up in could be a tad intimidating. It feels like entering a night club and you have your name ticked off a list before you even step inside. But we quickly warmed up to it with a few martinis at the bar (lychee for me, classic for the birthday boy). It's fun place for some great cocktails, even if you don't stop for dinner. Once seated (for our strictly 2 hour time slot of feeding  we arrived early to linger at the bar for a while first), we started with prawn toast and a duck salad. The large, bulbous sesame prawn toasts are in a different league to anything I've had in a long while. They're fleshy and sweet, topped with sesame and served with a side of fried seaweed and enoki mushrooms. (\u00a313.50) The crispy duck salad mixes moist strips of duck with crispy fresh greens, pomelo, pine nut and shallots. Very nice, if a tad forgettable. (\u00a319.50) Our main serving of roast duck with Chinese herbs is soon pronounced by TPG, serious duck addict, to be the best he's ever eaten. It's full juicy, fatty flavour is spiced up by some generous seasoning, and the texture of crispy skin against moist juicy meat is spot on. (\u00a321.00) Moist chunks of peppery, stir fried, rib-eye beef with merlot come spilling from a delicate, spindly nest. Again, big flavours and execution is just right. (\u00a318.80)Desserts are artistic creations. Naturally, TPG has the warm coconut rice pudding with mango caviar and black sesame crunch. I have the gorgeous buttermilk bavarois with blood orange jelly and fresh blood orange. (\u00a38.00 each). Both are stunning, with interesting, indulgent flavours  a party in your mouth. Hakkasan, under chef Tong Chee Hwee, has held a Michelin star since 2003. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is buzzing. Yes, Hakkasan is expensive  expect to upwards of \u00a350 per head for food, and prices can of course soar if you get stuck into the cocktails or the wagyu (there's pair of \u00a358 wagyu dishes). However, you can experience the glamour and some great Chinese food for a fraction of the price if you go for dim sum. It's fresh, interesting and the flavours pack some serious punch. I'll be back."

It's actually fairly unpretentious and certainly not stuffy. the best thing to go for is the Dim Sum at lunch. There's a way to do it where you can only pay around \u00a315 a head - just steer clear of the mineral water it's massively expensive. the best dishes to try are the Venison pork puff and all the cheung fun are pretty good. The service is always utterly charming without being OTT. I find the desserts a bit disappointing but overall I would say this is better than Hakkasan."

    "review": "This is apparently the only Chinese restaurant to be awarded with a michelin star. It is often rated as the best Chinese restaurant in London and maybe deservedly so. This is not your average Chinese eaterie. This is Chinese fine dining style. The food was good, though I can't really remember what we ate which is usually a sign that it wasn't that memorable. The decor is dark and fancy (apparently you can't take pictures here as the owner doesn't want unauthorised pictures of his restaurant circulating around - didn't test this rumour). Our party of four was sat on one of the tables around the sides. Apparently the main tables in the middle were fully booked, but actually it didn't look to me like it would be that nice sat at the tables in the middle. To sum up - good food, dark fancy decor, high prices. Would recommend it just for the experience."

Having revisited the restaurant during late August 2008, I'm in a totally different space. What a place! I've eaten in a host on Michelin* places in Europe and the USand this meal was excellent. Sesame prawn toasts, crispy duck salad, hot & sour soup, duck spring rolls, topped off with a couple of bottles of Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir. Excellent. We'll be back."

And in a way, it IS gimicky, but it's still damn good. You won't come here just for the food - you'll come here for the \"scene\" as well. But we were surprised that this place had the authenticity and deliciousness to back up the scenester vibe. Every dish on the menu is almost as good as the real thing served in Chinatown or Paddington or Bayswater, or even Vancouver, NYC, or LA. The dishes are well presented and tasty, and they should be, because you're paying an arm and a leg for courses that should cost half the amount.  The steamed dim sum was pretty good, as was the stir fried morning glory vegetables, but our favorite was a dish of chicken braised in a clay pot with dark soy, ginger, and vegetables. The flavor of the dish was deep and hearty and very, very satisfying."

However, do try to make sure that you don't get carried away with the ordering - which is very easy to do, as you will end up with too much food and a very hefy bill.\n We did have one problem with the wine - once opened and poured, the bottle was taken away from our table and placed in a bucket with several other bottles. Unfortunately, we did not get our bottle back and had to complain.\n Overall, this restaurant is a treat with great cocktails and fabulous food."

    "review": "Hakkasan is a Michelin star rated Chinese fusion restaurant located down a back alley in Central London. You  would not know it was there unless you were specifically looking for it. Hakkasan is not reliant on pedestrian traffic and yet it can be difficult to get a reservation. There is actually a dress code and formal shoes are required. If you are going to spend this kind of money on a meal you should dress up and make an effort anyway. Do make sure to bring the credit card with you because this is an extremely ridiculously expensive restaurant. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is romantic. If you work it right you will be too drunk at the end of the meal to care about the price.  It is rated number 19 out of the 50 best restaurants in the WORLD not just London. I think going to restaurants you can't really afford makes for a memorable and more appreciated night reserved for birthdays and anniversaries. When was the last memorable meal you had at Nandos?"

The duck, which I am not normally a fan of generally, was really tender and tasty and I would definitely recommend it. Best to get dishes to share on the table with your friends so you get to try lots of things. Had heard previously it was riduculously expensive so was surprised when it came to about \u00a340 a head (I thought it would be double). The items on the menu really vary in price - you have some mains for \u00a315 and some for \u00a360 so I guess it depends on what you order."

    "review": "I'm making my way through high-end Chinese restaurants in London. In general, I have a narrative in my mind that while some asian foods, like sushi, enjoy a high markup, Chinese food in the Western world is often seen as cheap takeaway. You expect to have your kung-pao chickens and beef and broccolis served up to you in a takeaway box for about \u00a35 - leading to caricatures like Panda Express in the states and Wok to Walk in the UK. The problem with these too for actual Chinese establishments is that because of this unidimensional view and a universal expectation of cheapness - Chinese restaurants end up battling over operational efficiency - cutting costs, skimping on taxes, paying minimum wage. Re-imagined, upscale Chinese restaurants would bring the benefit of giving Chinese chefs in the western world more freedom to experiment and explore while raising the overall expectation of what a Chinese restaurant could be.\nYauatcha, I'm visiting right on the cusp of having Duck and Rice yesterday. But Yauatcha is in style more similar to Hakkasan than it is Duck and Rice. So after I've eaten all of these foods, imagine my surprise when I realized that all three of these restaurants were created by the SAME GUY - Alan Yau; Yautcha of course being his namesake, Hakkasan named after his ethnic minority background of being Hakka and Duck and Rice I can only imagine because the guy probably GORGES himself on that stuff. Good for him.I happened to come with my Asian American roommate from New York that also went to Harvard (many shared identities as you can see) and we both had the Tou Chan. You can find the menu online, but I'll run through some of my favorite of the dishes:\nChicken Gyoza\nWild Mushroom Dumpling  - I generally like anything named \"wild mushroom x\" and this was no exception\nBeef in black-bean sauce - so good, it reminded me of my childhood favorite \"dou chi ling yu\" which is fish with black bean.\nUltimately a great meal, for a reasonable \u00a335.\nI also highly enjoyed the \"nan\" and the \"nu\" on the door and briefly wondered how a non-Chinese reader would be able to distinguish between the men and women's bathroom, until I looked more closely and saw the \"W\" and \"M\" etched into the doors."

The sweet and sour soup with mushroom was very flavorful and thick....and served piping hot in a bowl with a lid. The Thai chicken was crispy yet moist and tasty, not spicy.\nThe Kung pao chicken was quite good but had way too many peppers in it--they were a quarter of the dish! \nThe vegetable fried rice was so good-- lots of flavor.\nAnd we had one of their slices of mocha cake for dessert; so much flavor packed into a few delicious bites!\nPricey but worth it!"

I was expecting it to be westernized since it's not like your typical dim sum restaurant. \nI went solo so couldn't order too many things thus just got a few classics.\n- steamed pork buns : pork was good mix of sweet and savory and the buns are nicely filled with the pork, they didn't skimp on the filling. It was slightly oversteamed but the taste was still really yummy.\n- scallop and pork siu Mai : unlike traditional siu Mai, the scallop wasn't dried it was a fresh one! Probably why it was so expensive for just 3 pieces. I prefer the cheaper version with dried scallop but this was also quite tasty. \n- Xiao long bao(pork soup buns) : the wrapper is thicker than I usually prefer it but the taste of the soup and pork were on point! \nOverall really good experience, great service and ambiance. Heard their cocktails are worth trying as well. Will have to come back with a bunch of people to try more dishes!"

    "review": "A Michelin Chinese restaurant in Soho London that specializes in Dim Sum. It opened in 2004 by Alan Yau who also created Wagamama and Hakkasan. Rated as one of the top restaurants in London plus multiple locations worldwide.....I was excited to try this place. But what a shocking disappointment in regards to the food. \nThis place was highly recommended by some friends. They said this place offers some of the best Chinese food in London......I would 100% disagree. Maybe for non-Chinese people (which is all I saw in the restaurant).\nThe inside is a cool and sexy contemporary vibe. The ambiance with the bright floor, star-lit ceiling, neon lighting, and aquarium bar in the basement is a clever refreshing way to bring light to this otherwise dark and cave like space. \nWhen we arrived the hostess took our coats and bags and seated us at the bar downstairs for a few drink while our table was bring prepped. It was at that minute I noticed not one other Asians were eating here.....\nAt the bar downstairs the drinks were divine. My husband got cognac and me some tropical lychee non alcoholic drink. The bartender was excellent. Drinks were delicious. \nDishes are colourful with strong flavours and texture contrasts according to the website with dim sum as the highlight. \nOnce are table was ready they brought us to our table to start ordering. Here is what we ordered:\nScallop shui mai\nChar siu bun\nCrispy duck roll\nPrawn cheung fun\nWagyu beef puff\nStir-fry rib eye beef in black bean sauce\nEvery tasted off. The stir fry rib eye and crispy duck roll was the closest to authentic...even that was a far stretch. I looked straight into the kitchen and saw only Chinese chefs......I should have asked to speak to a chef and asked him to cook me something off the menu. My husband ordered so much because he was simply hungry. But I asked him to stop ordering, grab the check, and let's head to Chinatown to eat after here. I was not about to waste precious macros on bad food. \nService was pretty standard and could only get so good as it was super busy. The bartenders offered great service though. Definitely deserve a mention. \nI can see how this would get a Michelin Star for interior design, service, and playing/presentation. Food though no offense reminded me of PF Chang's in the states. I don't see how it get a Michelin Star. But that must be why not one Chinese person was seen here eating when I visited. \nGo if you want a sexy and fun dinner. But not if you want authentic dim sum."

I didn't try it that night, but the next day and it was soooo delicious! \nThe decor is designed to perfect. There were 3 layer compacted into the tiny cake: milk chocolate ganche, jasmine buttercream and honey buttercream and chocolate pop rocks! \nSERVICE: \nIf you want to come here just for the cakes, let the hostess know and they will call someone over to help you out at the cake station. The lady that helped us was really friendly! I asked if I could take a picture of the cake before she boxed it and she actually gave me the best looking one and asked if I wanted to take picture of any other cake. They box your cake in one of those boxes that you don't want to throw out.\nIf I'm ever back in London, I would come back just for the cakes!"

They accommodated us quickly and got us a seat in the bar area that worked out great.  The food was REALLY good and had a lot of variety.  \nFood - We tried a few different things as there were so many good options on the table.  Dim Sum, Duck and a Noodle Dish were the things that we tried:\nDim Sum - Char Sui Bun, Pork and Prawn Shu Mai and finally Chinese Chive and Prawn Dumplings.  All were very good.  Char Sui Buns are classic dim sum, great flavor.  The Pork and Prawn Shu Mai was good.  Finally the Chinese Chive and Prawn Dumpling were also done very well.  \nMains - We had the Crispy Aromatic Duck and the Singapore Stir fry vermicelli with prawns and squid.  The duck was incredible (first time trying it).  Not too oily and had great flavor.  I didn't have any of the noodles but wife really enjoyed it. \nAtmosphere - The restaurant is very modern looking and tastefully decorated.  We ended up sitting in the bar for dinner, but it didn't matter.  Many times I didnt feel that I was in a restaurant.  It felt like a cool place to hang out.  \nService - The service was top notch.  The servers were attentive, but not overbearing.  I never had to ask for a refill as they approached us at the right time.  The dishes (yes there were a lot) were brought out in stages as it didn't feel that we had things piling up.  We took our time and really enjoyed the experience.  \nGreat Job.

This is NOT the xiao long bao.  This is a small little pot lined with a dumpling wrap and stuffed with shrimp, scallop, and other delicious seafood bits.  The best part of this dish is the flavor of the soup that the dumpling is steamed in. \n- Shrimp cherng fun - The noodle wrap is very soft, yet not soggy.  The shrimp is also very fresh and crisp. \n- Turnip cake.

It is one of the few Michelin-starred Chinese restaurants. The ambiance is hip and has a night club feel to it. I'd compare Yauatcha to Hakkasan; I do prefer Yauatcha a little more.  \nExcept for the kitchen, I don't think there was a single Asian staff in the restaurant.  The wait staff is comprised of good looking young men and women that seemed like aspiring actors or models.  With that said, the service was professional and attentive. \nWhile the food (dim sum) is traditional the quality was steps beyond most dim sums I've had, even in L.A.  The non-Asian part of the restaurant is the large display of European desserts and hand-crafted gourmet chocolate.  There is also a 25-feet long macaron bar by the front window that makes every passerby stop and admire.  \nThe sweet and sour pork was delicious beyond my expectation. The batter was crispy, the pork seemed like lean pork tender loin and the sweetness and tartness of the sauce was perfectly balanced.  The softshell crab was served with garlic chips that looked like almond slices and, along the the Thai basil, added good body to the flavor of the lightly battered crab.  The various steamed dumplings were all delicately made and tasted great.  The biggest surprise of the meal was the baby bokchoy.  It looked quite simple without any garnish yet the flavor was quite complex.  I never thought that a plain vegetable like this can taste this good.  It tasted like it had been stir-fried with chicken stock and Shaoxing wine.\nThe desserts were all excellent and the presentation impressive. The tough part was to make the choice from so many options.\nExpect to pay for the superb dining experience; but it is worth the money."

You won't regret it!\nI went with a bag of 6 for 9.80 pounds, which is pretty affordable given Yauatcha's status; they could have easily marked up their prices! The 6 flavors I chose were the coconut, matcha yuzu, apricot pistachio, strawberry, salted caramel, and the sesame. Extra star for the superb service - for my last macaron, I couldn't decide, so I asked for suggestions. The employee recommended the popcorn or the coconut, in which I went with the coconut. To my surprise, she then gave me a popcorn macaron just because! If a popcorn macaron sounds weird to you (it sounded strange to me at first), fear not because it was absolutely delicious! Definitely was one of my favorites! \nAlthough they were all really good, the other highlights were the matcha yuzu, the coconut, and the sesame. Basically just get the Asian inspired flavors! \nAlso, these macarons come packaged in a cute little pink bow, making it a great gift :)"

    "review": "Michelin stars aren't just handed out to those who ask for them, and while i only sampled a few dessert offerings at Yauatcha as opposed to their flagship Cantonese dishes, I certainly see why they get the attention that they do. \nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\nFrom their super high end dessert bar to their very chic and contemporary formal dining area (with light that's oh so conducive to taking photos of your dishes), Yauatcha absolutely oozes class, and you can immediately spot the similarities to their mother ship Hakkasan (neon blue ring a bell?). Service is fast, friendly, and formal. Star Granted. \nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\nMacarons are expensive these days, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my macarons at Yauatcha, where were notably large, only priced out to be $2.10 USD each once I did the conversion from pounds. That's notably cheaper than (smaller) macarons that I've had at Pierre Herme in Paris, which is certainly a win. I also ordered a signature 'Chocolate Pebble' that was a staggering six pounds, but I really can't fault the prices of flagship specialty desserts. Star Granted. \nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\nOne thing I'll point out is that the macaron flavors were just a tad bit limited at Yauatcha compared to some other shops that I've been to. Sure they had salted caramel and coconut and orange, but missing were classics like vanilla and rose or fun contemporary options like apple pie or banana. That's not really a fault (Pierre Herme has the same issue), but it was note worthy. \nThe macarons themselves were excellent. Outside of the coconut all six of my macarons had excellent and more importantly consistent contrasting textures with powerful flavors on the back end, and the salted caramel in particular was divine. \nArguably most surprising was the Chocolate Pebble, which was a symphony of truffle and liquid chocolate that had me appreciating chocolate like I'm not sure I ever have done. Dual Stars Granted. \nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\nYauatcha has earned all of the acclaim they've received, but their macarons fall ever so short compared to my all-time global favorites at Miann (Auckland) and Pierre Herme (Paris). I will certainly be back for the food though to give Yauatcha a proper and more thorough look. No Star Granted."

We also had the beef hor fun noodles, which went nicely with the dim sums. Lastly, they had a rather modern and western desserts menu, which we enjoyed to top off the meal.\nHaving said all that, I wasn't so sure if it lived up to all the fame and hype. Everything was good, but I felt lacked a differentiating personality. \nService was overall good, though our waiter was quite curt. He seemed to be in a bad mood, and our interactions were not very pleasant. \nAmbience was posh -- possibly the most modern and western dim sum place I've been to. A good choice if you're looking to impress whilst also enjoying down to earth dim sums. \nOverall, would recommend it, but don't keep your expectations up too high."

However, abysmal service soured my whole experience, and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it. \nRight from the start, my server gave no greeting, did not ask if I had any questions, did not explain the menu (and it's quite a huge menu to navigate), just said \"You ready?\" and waited with his notepad. He was entirely unhelpful when I asked him to describe certain dishes, giving shrugs or an apathetic \"Yeah, it's good.\" \nWhen I asked for recommendations, he asked if I had dietary restrictions. I told him I did not eat cilantro, and the one item he recommended (wild mushroom dumplings) had cilantro. After taking a bite, I left the rest untouched - but I never saw the server again, and even when I mentioned to another server what had happened, there was no attempt to apologize, or ask if I'd like to order something else in its place.  \nThe other dumplings I got (poached chicken) were excellent. I also tried the crispy duck - and while I wanted to like it because it was a different take on Peking duck (I have no idea how it was prepared as that was - of course - not explained, but the duck was shredded in front of you instead of sliced), it was so dry that it was inedible without the sauce (which my server said would be \"oyster sauce\" - it was not - it was the classic Peking duck sauce). \nToo bad. Hope you have better luck than I did at this joint."

Water was not refilled and my utensils were not changed even though we asked for new plates. Our table was left uncleaned until we had to ask the manager to wipe it after 10 minutes or so.

They phoned me up 2 days beforehand to check that I was still coming which was good. \nArrived at the restaurant and the staff were really friendly. Sat down and was offered water and a Cucumber dish with 3 difference dips. One was really hot (chilli type dip) another more of a sweet and sour type and the last one I think was soy sauce. Ordered our drinks but had to wait 45mins for it to arrive which was the most annoying thing of the evening. First dish arrived which was the Venison puff, tasty bits of meat in a pastry with sesame seeds on top. Had to wait around another 15-20 mins or so for the next 3 dishes to arrive, scallop shui mai which was delicious, lobster dumpling which had a hint of ginger. Last one was Champagne scallops which was also nice. We then had to wait another 20 or so minutes for our beef in black bean sauce and rice and noodles dishes to arrive. When they came, only the rice and noodles arrived and we had to wait about 10 mins for the beef to turn up. By the time it came the noodles were cold. Shame, because the beef was really nice and soft!!! Didn't bother ordering desert because we couldn't be bothered to wait again and we had already been sitting on the table for nearly 2 hours. Asked for the bill (waited another 10 mins for it)\nThe food was top notch, staff really friendly. Only thing that stops it being 5 stars was all the waiting about.

As requested, we re-confirmed the day before for 8pm. So far business as usual.\nWe arrived at exactly 8pm, and got our table downstairs as requested.\nUpon ordering, our waiter seemed quite uninterested, and was almost 'bitchy' when I asked about a dish we had the previous time. Hmmm.\nThe music was extremely loud, even more so than previous times, which made conversation quite strenuous.  We overheard the table next to us complain about the same problem. (On a separate note, they were annoyed as well about getting their main course before their starters).\nThe food quality was excellent, as always.  Nothing to say about that.\nHOWEVER .. when we decided to order desserts at 9pm (one hour after arriving, ordering, and getting our dishes), we were told that \"our table was booked only until 9:15pm, so it would be almost impossible to serve us desserts\". Wait. WHAT?\nSo we called the maitre d' to enquire about this.  He first started asking us if we were walk-ins.  Then proceeded to tell us that our reservation was for 7pm and we'd been an hour late. SERIOUSLY?  How UNPROFESSIONAL can one be?\nIf we'd been an hour late, our table would have been gone for 45 mins, since they have a 15min holding policy, so that excuse didn't fly! And not knowing we booked several weeks in advance, and then making us feel like it was our fault? NO WAY!\nAs said, the quality of the food was excellent, but the service is an absolute disgrace!\nIn the end, the desserts were on the house, but a situation like this should NEVER have occurred in a Michelin-star restaurant!\nThe whole experience left us leaving quite annoyed and bitter, and ruined what should have been a memorable anniversary dinner.\nWe'll give Yauatcha another try next time, but if this is the standard they're holding up now, it's bye-bye, never again."

The chairs that we sat in were uncomfortable and really low to the ground, and the tables were so close to each other that any movement to the side results in you rubbing against the person sitting next to you.  The service also leaves much to be desired; it was really slow, and it took forever to get a waiter's attention.\nSome of the dishes we got were pretty good.  The pork and prawn shui mai and the prawn and beancurd cheung fun were our two favorites, and we really enjoyed them.  The crispy duck roll was pretty mediocre; you could get something better at other dim sum restaurants.  When we ordered the chicken cheung fun, however, the dish came out very soggy and the chicken was really bland and dry.  The edamame truffle dumpling had a weirdly crunchy texture, and the flavors didn't blend well at all.\nI probably would've given this restaurant a 3-star rating if it did not have a Michelin star and was less pricey.

After one of the best Asian cuisine dining experiences I've had in London to date, it's a must! \nFor the folks who want to try Yauatcha / those who might've been and didn't rate it all too highly - this is for you!\nI don't ever post to sway your decision to return to a restaurant you mightn't have rated 5 stars on your first visit, but thought I had to share some dish recommendations that you absolutely need to try (disclaimer: I went with a group of friends, including one who gave it 5 stars (after a forgettable first time visit last year)) \nHere's what you must, must, must order!\n- Jasmine tea smoked ribs\n- Crispy duck roll\n- Roasted duck pumpkin puff with pine nut\n- Sticky rice\nMake sure you save room for desert! \n- Raspberry delice \n- Any of their macarons (yes!)"

Everyone is being all fake polite so no one claims them initially as you are secretly eyeing the dumplings, willing someone to just give up already in favour of those with hungrier stomachs (aka you).  Hey, no shame, we've all been there before...\nFortunately this completely hypothetical scenario never has to happen at Yauatcha! They just rolled out their Supreme Saturdays menu where they serve a generous tasting of assorted steamed and fried dim sum for a reasonable price and for those selfish eaters, you don't have to worry about sharing with others :). \nCan't make it on the weekend? Their Taste of Yauatcha menu offered on weekdays is just as good!\nI personally am a fan of their fusion, upscale dim sum items (e.g., prawn and bean curd cherng fun, curry taro puffs) but I'm aware it's not for everyone. Fear not, however, as they also serve a selection of the traditional items for all you purists out there."

Place has a really cool ambiance/vibe and it was packed on a Monday night. We got the dim sum meal which comes with multiple pre-chosen courses (minimum of 2 people) and also ordered some egg fried rice to go with it. At first they come out with some really good dim sum but I was wondering if we were still gonna be hungry after...then the duck confit and fried calimari / chicken comes out and you realize that there's soooooo much food. We were all stuffed when we left. I would definitely go back here. Very very good. Also, a lot of other tables ordered the ribs which I don't know how they cooked them but they looked soooo good too."

    "review": "I am comparing this against probably the best dim sum joint in London.  Honestly, I have to say there is only Hakkasan Hanway Place which does the best in London.  This is the sister company.  It doesn't have that cool, dark, chic vibe like Hakkasan but the food is comparable.  If I have to say which is better, then of course, Hakkasan is a tad better.  The service here is really good and staff as attentive.  They have no attitude issues like some Chinese restaurant and are really professional.  Try to book in advance but if you come here on a Sunday afternoon dim sum time, then be prepared to wait.  That's when the Chinese family have their big outing and eating dim sum.  We had an issue with our last order and it came really late.  We decided to cancel and the manager was quick to come and apologise.  They even gave us free dessert each so we were happy for this.  This is what you call professional.  If you go to some other restaurants, they apologise and bring the food out late right when you are cancelling it and you are forced to eat them or take them home.  However, the one star is omitted due to Hakkasan performing slightly better.  That said, it is still probably one of the best dim sum in London so I would not miss giving this place a try at all.  Must go in London."

    "review": "I liked their food but I didn't go crazy and it didn't make me want to return tomorrow. Here are the details:\nOne general observation - all dishes were underseasoned ranging from moderately to seriously.  That said, since every dish was made in house from scratch, I think is enough for the above rating.\n- Singapore noodles - the blandest of all dishes I tasted.  Sigapore noodles need a (serious) kick and they tried to accomplish that by adding sliced red chili peppers.  Unfortunately, the peppers were as mild as they get... This dish has a lot of potential, but they need to fix the seasoning.\n- Beef fun noodles - seasoned better than the above Singapore noodles, but still on the short side.  I liked the way the beef was prepared.  A classic dish that desperately needs a twist.\n- Dim sum - good to very good, but also mostly neutral."

It turns out that Yauatcha has a Michelin star and maybe it deserves it, but if you're looking for dim sums there's a couple of similarly good (non-starred) options in China Town."

So fast forward some years and I'm finally seated inside. \nIf I want dim sum, I don't need to pay such an extortionate price. I could just opt for an authentic place down the road in Chinatown. So I opted to try a few plates, unique to Yauatcha instead. \nWas I impressed? Sadly not that much. Maybe it was because I'd paid double (or even triple) the price for a few dumplings. Or maybe it's because I'd had so much expectation for it for so long. \nSo I guess, if you're looking for decent authentic dimsum, don't go to Yauatcha. If you're looking for a fancy venue, then Yauatcha is for you!"

After trying a place close by with an insane wait, my group was fortunate to stumble upon a free table at exactly the right time. \nUsually when I think of dim sim, I think of carts coming by or offering delicious, but often unsophisticated looking dumplings and buns. Yauatcha is a dim sum restaurant that made me feel like a grownup (and that is not something that I say lightly). \nThe dishes here were excellent. My group and I ate about 8-10 plates between us, and each item was fantastic. The char siu buns were steamed to perfection. The shrimp and bean curd cheng du...I could have eaten like three plates of that. The dumplings (considering I had about 3 different kinds) were all inhaled. And the turnip cake was the best turnip cake in the history of turnip cakes. \nThe plates are small, but shareable with about 3-4 pieces per dumpling and buns. Topping off our meal with some delicious sake made the entire experience complete.\nI felt a little out of place with my jeans here, and had I known this is where we were going to end up, I would have opted for something dressier. \nThe wait staff and FOH managers were very accommodating, and would check up on us often. Or suggest another delicious dish for our meal.\nSo many stars. I'm sad I had to stop at five. This place was one of the best meals that I have ever had."

    "review": "Hip and happening this Chinese restaurant is delicious. Sort of... People with shellfish allergies beware, as most dishes served here are with oyster sauce, even dishes that look vegetarian, and what first looks like an extensive and exciting menu limits those people with shellfish allergies down to a a measly few dishes to choose from. And when I say measly, I mean you can count the selection on one hand. This is important to note as one in our party was allergic and this meant that person had little to eat. \nEverybody else feasted. And the cuisine while distinctively Chinese had a modern approach which made for a truly tasty experience. Pork belly with truffles... foie gras, duck, and delightful pumpkin dim sum shaped into little pumpkins were divine. \nWe came for desserts, however we were disappointed as by the time we were finished with our meal, the tempting dessert selections we had seen upon entering the restaurant were nearly all sold out and we were left with little to choose from. So, that was sort of the theme of the night here at Yauatcha: So much to tempt, so little actually available. \nThe decor was trying too hard with its fish aquariums and Asian inspired seating. The seats themselves were very close to the ground and people were too close and on top of each other. My chair was next to one of the pillars and I had to sit a bit sideways and nearly on top of the table, so it was a bit uncomfortable. And yes, a bit noisy. Waitstaff too could have been a bit more attentive and not so rushed. \nIts a shame really as it is a fun place, great for small groups of friends. I think it definitely merits a try, as what was good, was tasty, but perhaps avoid Saturday night and the weekends."

And you're ushered downstairs to a star lit dim room. \nYauatcha is more a fusion sort of dim sum. Everything we had was typical chinese dim sum but they were just presented so clean and tasted mediocre. My parents remarked that we could get better dim sum for way cheaper back in San Francisco. I enjoyed all of the dishes we got, but I believe that there was nothing special about any of them. All of the plates were remarkably tiny sized for the amount we paid for it. \nThe only dish I thought was worth checking out were the Prawn & Beancurd Cheung Fun. \nOh and this place is the slowest service I have ever experienced before.. It takes forever to get anything done. Food comes out slow, waiters never seem to see you, water takes forever to come to the table. Oh and make sure you ask for tap water or they'll charge you for still water. \nI would recommend just coming here for drinks and desserts. We tried the Raspberry Delice. It looked better than it tasted. The lychee ice cream that came with it was much more delicious and unique."

    "review": "I've been going on and off pretty much since it's opened and it's retained its quality. Of the dozen places I've been to in London this is by far the best and the only one that comes close to what I'm used to in Hong Kong and Singapore, although I have yet to try Hakkasan which is supposed to be on the level.\nYauatcha brings modern cooking techniques and interesting ingredients to dim sum. The venison puff is a textbook butter pastry with French, rather than Cantonese techniques. The parcels (sorry, \"spinach prawn dumplings\") would not be out of place in a Vietnamese kitchen and are also reminiscent of greek leaf rice parcels. There are a few twists on classics, such as the pumpkin crystal dumpling which plays pumpkin's softer texture against just a hint of crunchy water chestnut (expected) and the oily nasal nuttiness of pine nuts (unexpected). Since the classics are done well without using the usual bulk frozen quality items, they taste different: the prawn and deep fried tofu cheung fun was crispier and more flavourful than expected although it's a shame they hold on to the sauce pot after pouring. The kitchen team here has taste and knowledge and the cooking is consistent. I like it, authenticity gets boring after a while.\nThey have always had amazing desserts but having not had one in 3 years I cannot comment on whether quality has been maintained, only point out that many tables were ordering some and they still look very pretty and skilled.\nThe restaurant itself is still claustrophobic downstairs, although it feels less packed than when it first opened years ago. There is also less queue, although it is still full. The audience, visually, seems half Chinese, and sounds mainland, probably a good sign, from large groups of men to lone diners enjoying a taste of home. The waitstaff has become more European.\nPrices feel much higher (4-5 GBP for the cheapest punnets), maybe I'm not used to London eye wateringly high food prices anymore, they are high at all the yum cha we tried this trip. I forgot that the \"pot\" did not have leaves and you have to pay twice as much if you want to be able to re-brew. One of the many ways in which your bill can skyrocket here, especially if you are used to tea being included.\nThe other way in which it does not feel like yum cha is that you are somewhat rushed every step of the way. The seating is uncomfortably low, the space between tables limited, the space noisy (downstairs especially), your legs hit the table legs, and they start cleaning your table before you've even finished your pot of tea. But I expect this considering the location, fame and long queue. If they let people linger 3 hours there wouldn't be any tables for walk ins and the prices would be even higher.\nWell, sometimes you want to have some yum cha that does not taste of MSG and frozen prawn and this is the place to go for it in London. Maybe I should try Hakkasan some time but old habits die hard."

Our favorite was the dim sum shrimp with beancurd and the prawn toast balls ( which we re-ordered) . Other dishes we tried included chicken noodles , jasmine tea ribs , scallop din sum and a few others , all great. Our vegetarian companions largely enjoyed their dishes too, apart from two that not one of our party , including the non- veggies very much disliked. Truffle is normally something that all of us enjoy , but not this time - the truffle flavored dim sum was awful and the taste just felt wrong ( for all 7 of us ). Likewise we had the same issue with the truffle spring rolls. We could not place it but something was not right as these dishes did not impress and left an awful taste and the gooey texture did not help. The manager was very accommodating and did not hesitate to remove the dishes from the bill , a gesture of goodwill which was much appreciated. Aside from the strange tasting truffle dishes we all love this place and my suggestion would be to try each and every one of the seafood dishes , appetizers and mains as these were fantastic !

We have one of their locations opening in Houston so had to taste their prime restaurant first. Reservations were made through OpenTable so it was fairly easy when I tried. We were greeted by the hostesses and brought down to their lower level dining area. Nice atmosphere.  Looking at their menu, it had so much a variety and different twists on traditional dim sum. My bf and I were so stoked. We ordered the Scallop Shu Mai, Lobster dumpling w/ tobiko, king crab dumpling, traditional shu mai (pork & shrimp), prawn cheung fun (shrimp roll wrapped in a clear rice layer),  and curry taro cake. The presentation for each dish was beautiful, they all looked so tasty. However, actually eating it... very mediocre. Maybe my taste palette is different from the dim sum I'm accustomed to, but the price and the hype didn't really justify what I tasted. Everything tasted exactly what it is. The lobster dumpling just tasted like pieces of lobster, the kind crab tasted like bits of king crab. The curry taro puffs were more overwhelming with curry than taro. The shrimp roll was ok... Very plain and bland. Scallop shu mai tasted like scallop. Even the traditional shu mai was ok...  All of them tasted like what it is, but nothing more. All of the ingredients did taste quite fresh, but it lacked so much in the flavor department. Quite disappointing. Did not get a chance to try any of their desserts. Service was good."

    "review": "In short, I think Yauatcha is over hyped and over priced. \nPositives:\n- Design and atmosphere: very posh, intimate, nice lighting, nothing like a loud traditional dim sum place\n- Wine list: most extensive wine list I've ever seen in a dim sum place, they also have a trendy looking bar\n- Dessert bar: they look like works of art, just so pleasant to look at. \nThe rest is not as jolly: \nOn this bitter cold night I decided to reward myself for walking around Oxford University all day by coming to Yauatcha. I've heard so much about it and there are more than 100 reviews with an average of 4 stars, it's about time we meet ;). \nSo I decided to examine the place by the 4 basics:\n- Shrimp Chang Fun\n- Chicken feet\n- Pot stickers\n- Gai Lan (Chinese broccoli)\nFood wasn't bad, but not among the top of my dim sum billboard either. Chang fun was smooth, but the prawns were a bit fishy (could be the a different kind from what I'm used to). Chicken feet were a little too sweet and too greasy (they usually are). Pot stickers were okay, not enough meat in the stuffing. And gai lan. Oh the garlic gai lan, it's very good but considering it's just steamed vegetable stir fried with garlic, there's no way it should cost more than 8 bloody pounds!  That can buy me 2 lunches! 3 from Tesco! \nMost authentic dim sum place will serve you tea for free. Not at Yauatcha, where they have a big tea menu with fancy names. While I'm in no position of judging the various English tea,  I know my Chinese green/black/floral tea pretty well, and that Pu Er served with no tea leaf is definitely no more than mediocrity (hence is not worth 5 pounds). \nIn the end I was full and my craving was somewhat resolved. But the sum wasn't so dim - it ended up being a 35 pounds meal. Ouch. \nAlthough the cakes looked lovely, I had no stomach or budget to try any, if I ever return it'd be for the desserts. \nIt's not surprising to me though, knowing that this place is created by Alan Yau, who also created Wagamama. Basically his target is Asian food for non-native Asians, and I don't blame him, the market is big and margin is fat.  I should have known better. I do, however, take objection to the fact that this place was rated two Michelin-star. It does not deserve it, and it made me believe that nowadays Michelin rating is more an indicator of the price, not the food."

I hesitated a lot but finally decided on the milk chocolate and jasmine mousse with honey panna cotta one and it was delicious. \nThe mousse was very light and the panna cotta soft, the chocolate cake moist and the addition of the popping candy was delightful though I wish there had been a bit more. Entremets often lose on texture and taste because of the gelatin they use to make them but this wasn't the case and I could have eaten another one of these right away!\nService was perfect, the lady described all of the cakes and answered all my questions while I was trying to decide and even offered to let me sample a raspberry and chocolate macaron which was out of this world!\nYou can go in there with your eyes closed and I will be looking forward to an occasion to eat at the restaurant, even just for the dessert."

    "review": "Originally founded by Alan Yau, this Michelin-starred restaurant serves high-end dim sum. Craving Asian food in a sea of fish n chip restaurants and pubs, my travel buddy convinced me to give this place a shot. \nFOOD: \n1) Lotus wrap\n-Standard dim sum, but very good. \n2) Jasmine tea braised ribs\n-Ahh the famous tea braised ribs! I found the ribs to be good, but since it was served without rice, it tasted almost overseasoned with sauce. We ended up ordering white rice, which took ages to arrive, and the rice ended up being dry. Overall, a good dish, but did not live up to the hype for me.  \n3) Pumpkin puffs\n-My absolute favorite part of my experience. Presented as 3 mini orange pumpkins, the exterior is fried mochi (a little firmer than ham sui gok). When you crack open the puff, the inside has pine nuts and shredded duck. The interior is similar to the inside of a pumpkin- stringy with seeds. The taste was amazing and the design was so creative. It was very memorable!\nSERVICE:\nThe hostess was friendly and seated us when our table was ready. \nThe server was constantly unavailable. After putting in our orders, he never came back. Different servers brought us food and we had to flag down a random server to order rice. By the time the rice arrived, the braised ribs were cold. We should have cancelled the order. No one checked up on us. We had to flag down a server down to bring us the bill. \nIn a nut shell: Mediocre service, good food."

    "review": "It may not look like much from the outside but as soon as you enter Yauatcha you're in for a treat. As you wait for your table to be set up you can see all the luxurious dessert available from their dessert counter; this is surely enough to heighten up your anticipation of what's to come. My party of 6 was led downstairs into a sparkling underground dining area lit up with life-like (but actually fake) candles and twinkling lights on the ceiling that mimic stars. Yauatcha achieves what Hakkasan and Hutong fail to do, which is to create a special twilight-like atmosphere without plunging the restaurant into darkness; testament to this is that photos can still be taken with the utmost clarity whereby all the natural colours of the food are proudly visible.\nSo, the first impression Yauatcha achieves is certainly promising, but what of the meal itself? Well the menu is an issue...the issue is, there are so many fabulous options to choose from! Plus you are mindfully conscious of the fact that you want to leave enough space in your stomach to consume at least one of the delightful desserts you've just seen and etched into your brain. However, one of the fabulous benefits of dining with a group of friends is that you have a greater capacity for ordering more, feasting your eyes on more and trying out more.\nThe Duck Roll had a suitably crispy but light exterior with a satisfyingly meaty filling. The Scallop Shuimai was delicately soft with a quality offering of roe on top. The Siew Long Bun dumplings were tasty but easily split, letting out the juice of the dumpling - which is one of the cardinal sins of this type of dumpling; but it is hard to get these perfect. The Wheat Squid was so very well flavoured with dried shallots, garlic, spring onion and chilli peppers that I found myself lapping up all these extra bits until my tongue was burning from all the spice (- so be warned not to get carried away with polishing this dish off). The Beancurd and Prawn Cheung Fun had a beautifully smooth exterior around a crispy beancurd layer encasing a juicy prawn filling. The Crystal Pumpkin Dumplings were an attractive orange colour and delicately handcrafted to give one of the most original versions of dumplings that I've ever seen. The Seafood Asparagus dish was another fantastic creation, with sweet scallop and prawn amongst crunchy carrot and asparagus, all spilling out of a beautiful rice cracker shaped like an oyster. Probably the only dishes that were unexceptional were the seafood noodles and vegetarian noodles which were satisfactory but indistinctive and Yauatcha's attempt at vegetarian duck which was a good effort, with the texture of the duck and seaweed being a nice touch but the overall taste being a bit too salty.\nThe meal and experience of Yauatcha would not be complete without trying their dessert. As mentioned from the offset, the dessert on offer is enough to make your mouth water and your eyes widen. At this stage of my indulgent meal I was still able to spoil myself with one and a half desserts. The Exotic Pandan Dessert is a remarkable construction of thin layers of pandan cake, cream and mango filling with a shiny delicate gel on top that exhibits an intricate design. The cake is also accompanied by a dollop of smooth mango sorbet and the whole dessert is decorated with delightful titbits. The pear almond dessert was beautifully put together with the a smooth pear-flavoured layer on top of a quality biscuit base alongside a helping of nuts, a dashing of cream, a couple of pretty petals, a dollop of coffee-flavoured ice cream and a musky dessert sauce on the side. Needless to say, the desserts that Yauatcha serves up are truly a treat: with intricate designs, great colour combinations and a creative combination of textures and taste. \nAs you can see, the whole dining experience at Yauatcha was exemplary and to top it all off, our waitress, Marjorie, was the most patient, accommodating, efficient and genuinely friendly waitress that I can ever remember having at any restaurant. The only mini-annoyance I have is that we were billed for the still water (one bottle of Still Water = \u00a33.90) and not forewarned about this (which unfortunately can happen in restaurants if you don't check beforehand when they ask you if you want water). So, this aside, Yauatcha is for sure a restaurant to visit if you desire excellent quality Chinese food with original ideas and authentic Chinese recipes complementing each other at every turn. The desserts are sublime and the array of drinks well concocted. The location convenient, the atmosphere positive and the service as perfect as you could hope for."

I would book if I wanted to take more than 4 people though. I found the tables a little uncomfortable when sat at them but not something that would prevent me coming back.\nThe service is high end, with the staff being very attentive and 100x more friendly than your usual Chinese (get em in, feed em, get em out) restaurant. \nThe food is probably one of the best dumpling places in central London, they have a great selection and its all made to a high quality. I also like the small quirky takes they have on classic dishes. \nThe best way to sell this place from me is... I don't really like Chinese food but I can always be persuaded to come here (especially is someone else is paying!)"

We also had delicious Singapore noodles and a fantastic shrimp dish that I can't recall the name of.

The ingredients are super fresh, the flavor is authentic and the presentation is elegant. This is not your stereotypical dim sum place where people hustle for food. Don't get me wrong, I love that atmosphere. Yauatcha is more posh and proper, you get tiny baskets of food brought your table with a smile. \nShrimp dumpling is served at every dim sum restaurant and it is my litmus test for authenticity of a dim sum place. The Shrimp dumpling here among the best I have tasted. They are juice and fresh and you can taste the subtle flavor of the bamboo shoots inside. Everything is really good here, but I particularly like the Xiao Long Bao, turnip cake, shrimp cheung fun, fried chicken chive dumpling, and we can't forget the congee! The pork and preserved egg congee is out of control tasty and perfect for a cold and rainy day in London! \nNo meal is completed without good desserts, and apparently this rule applies to dim sum as well. The desserts here are beautiful, delicate and mouth watering. If you are too full you can bring these lovely babies home to enjoy and prolong the whole experience. \nYou already figured this is not your typical dim sum place, so don't expect they to top up water for your teapot! They charge you for each pot of tea, which I think is not cool. Oh well, nowhere is perfect!"

    "review": "5 stars for the food, -3 for the poor service. I had extremely high hopes for BOTH the food and service, but I was sadly very disappointed. My friend and I had a reservation for 5 pm and were immediately seated upon arriving. Good. Then, we sat there for a good 5 minutes without a menu - heck, we weren't even acknowledged. We had to ASK for the menu. I mean, really? Is it not logical to bring the menu when you seat someone? Anyway, we went for the \"Taste of Yauatcha\" since it included a nice selection of the dim sum options for a great price (28.88 for 2 people). For drinks we just asked for tap water...which arrived 10 minutes later, after having to ask twice. The first six dishes arrived fairly quickly, which was nice. The spring roll, baked venison puff, har gau, prawn shui mai, and siew long bao were all incredibly tasty - definitely the best dim sum I've ever had. After that though, our experience went very downhill.\nWe waited 20 minutes before our next dish arrived, which might have been understandable except for the fact that the table next to us - who ordered around 10 minutes after we did - got their next dishes (they ordered the tasting menu too) before us. They weren't even done with the first six, which we had finished long before their first six even arrived. What made me even more upset was that I could literally SEE the dishes sitting on a nearby cart as the waiters stood by nonchalantly minding their own business, chatting amongst themselves. After a while we also decided to ask for a tea refill, but were told that a refill would incur an extra charge because they don't reuse the leaves. Ummmm ok, whatever.\nOur last 2 dishes came about 1.5 hours after we first ordered. The cheung fun and stick rice in lotus leaf were both absolutely amazing. Again, they were the best I've ever tried. After finishing, we considered getting dessert but the service was so annoyingly inattentive we figured it would be more efficient to go to order directly from the patisserie bar. So we paid and did just that. \nOverall, all I can think about is how utterly appalling and slow/inconsistent the service was. The waiters were not at all attentive - not once did they check in on us - and they also treated us very coolly. Whenever we asked for something, they would just briskly set the thing on the table and leave without glancing once at us. Same thing when we asked for the check - they literally dropped the bill onto the table and left. No \"thank you\" or \"hope you enjoyed your dinner.\" Just \"here's the bill ok bye.\" Even when we were paying, the waiter didn't even have the courtesy to ask us the amount we wanted to pay - she just punched her own number in and stuck her hand out for our credit cards. Sorry lady, not that easy. It actually mattered this time because the amount we wanted to pay was different from the receipt because the service was SO bad we didn't want to pay the service charge - which we've NEVER done before. Honestly though, they didn't deserve it AT ALL.\nYauatcha - sure, your food is good. But your service is also terrible. So no, I will not be back, and I would not recommend anyone to visit either unless they're ok with sloppy, disrespectful, and terribly disappointing service."

The restaurant was beautifully decorated that was modern with an asian twist. \nAfter looking over the menu, we ordered some cocktails and a few dishes. The dishes are small for a dim sum place but it was expected since this was more of a fancier take on dim sum. Everything that we ordered was delicious! Also the drinks were great. I the only thing was the price. I figured that the price reflected not the food but the owner and status of the restaurant. \nOverall, I would definitely recommend to anyone who is not from San Francisco."

    "review": "Where to begin on Yauatcha? I want to give it 5 stars, as the aspects that were good, were excellent. But the bits that weren't good were pretty darn poor. It's worth a visit, but probably not a return - unless you're coming back for dessert. So, can we say three and a half stars?\nI've heard mixed things about the staff, but I have to say we didn't have any problems. They were very nice, accommodating, etc. Our main waiter was a bit hard to track down so we ended up waiting a bit longer than we would have wanted to order some things, and one of the staff tried clearing away a plate while someone was still eating off it, but other than that, it was fine. \nFoodwise, the wagyu beef puffs and chinese chive and prawn shumai were big hits, and we ordered a second round of each. I loved the scallop shumai (but be warned: I burned the roof of my mouth and am still feeling it a day later). I didn't try it, but the beef shumai ws a big letdown for everyone at the table, as was the pork and prawn shaumai. I don't think we finished either order (which says something, as the portions are quite small - 3 pieces of beef shumai, for example, when you'd get 4 for the same price at other places). \nI had the seafood dumpling soup, which was very very good. I loved the broth (and they served it with a bit of sauce to put in, which really made it taste incredible. But, again, price is a concern: \u00a36.70 for a tiny tureen of soup with one dumpling. \nWe also got a couple of mains to share: the quarter duck and the stir fry pepper chili seafood with asparagus. The duck was alright. A bit dry, but decent. The seafood dish was a definite disappointment. The scallops and shrimp were cooked very well, as was the asparagus, but the dominant flavour was salt. It was a really shame, as we loved the seafood-based chili sauce they put on the table with the shumai, and hoped the seafood chili dish would be just as good. The jasmine rice we got with it was a tad overcooked, too. \nFor dessert we got a raspberry delice to share, which was amazing. Imagine a bit of lychee surrounded chocolate mouse shaped like a rose and covered in a velvety raspberry coating. So rich and so beautiful. And definitely something to return for - everyone absolutely loved it. The rest of the food? Well, most of the dim sum was a hit, if that helps?\nOverall cost was \u00a3170 for four (though with only two \"main\" dishes) which included 2 beers and 2 harder drinks (vodka/whiskey on the rocks, no cocktails). For that price I would have thought we walked out stuffed and/or overwhelmed with how good the food was. We did neither."

Great dumpling and Asian menu.  \nHighlights:  Delicious dumplings and noodles cooked perfectly,  Ample quantity to share, Easy to make reservations, Reasonably priced, Great customer service and Nice big dinning area.\nCan improve:  We had an issue with the dessert, our waiter raved about the chocolate pebble and then told us that they had sold out.  So we ordered another chocolate option and it was horrible.  But the table next to us ordered their chocolate pebble 5 mins after we were told it was sold out, and they amazingly got theirs.  I shared the incident with the manager who was happy to remedy the situation and give us one for take away.  The chocolate pebble was amazing but it ruined the experience a little.  When you are celebrating a birthday and the dessert is a downer then it ruins the evening.  Our waiter did not even acknowledge or apologize.  Second issue I had was that we had some food left over and they would not offer take away.  No matter how fancy the place, if I pay for something then you can't tell me that I can take it away, plus I hate wasting food and would rather bring it home to finish or donate to someone who is hungry outside than have it go in the trash.  \nBenchmark:  They are really good and come on par with Ping Pong.  I like this place better.\nDined in April 2016 and will return."

This is a completely different league of its own and yes I have tried sf dim sum, Sydney/ LA/nyc /Hong Kong/ Dubai /Auckland ... . This is not about size or price and Americans always make everything too big. if u want that then go to a supermarket and microwave at home.  Yauatcha is simply some of the best dumplings I ever ate plus fantastic combinations like the soft shell crab with curry almonds or fried squid with oat. I never tried the meat here so not sure. Only seafood or veggies and it's all been excellent quality . No msg or frozen prawns reheated and soaking in cheap oil like most restaurants in most china towns... This is simply high end fantastic quality. As for the friendliness of staff , that's perhaps the only issue... But hey I'm here for the food... U don't get Michelin stars for bad quality.

Now this was very good value, and it's true, the dim sum are a twist on the original and prepared with exceptional care (truffle oil in spring rolls?? it works.)\nSecond time I went, we had more standard items off the menu. The dishes tasted good, with obviously quality ingredients, but not overwhelmingly different from the equivalent dish you'd get at a regular chinese restaurant. Maybe it's just me, but perhaps it's hard to get subtle, inventive \"haut cuisine\" type flavors in Chinese food. \nI'd go back, especially for the tasting menu, but what I love about Chinese food wasn't totally there in the main dishes.\nA good plus though - great tea selection, and if you order a few, you can really compare and contrast."

Something better than the cheap DimSum shops that sells SiuMai @ 3 for $1.50 (USD). Bellow is a list of what we ordered.\nTea Smoked Ribs - It was tasty and falls right off the bone. However, it has no tea flavor, false advertisement. it is not different than those BBQ Ribs you find at your local Chinese BBQ shop for a fraction of the price.\nPork SiuMai - It tasted and looked exactly like those you can find at your local dimsum shop for a fraction of the price.\nBeef Rice Roll - I actually loved this dish. They used Sukiyaki grade beef instead of the traditional minced beef. the only dish I enjoyed. \nChicken Feet - what can i say, it was chopped in half, not an whole feet. too many small broken bones that irritated the sh*** out of me. \nXLB - I prefer this dish at either DTF or any other XLB shop. \nThe atmosphere was a miss in my opinion. The waiter sat us at the street level where a low table paired with small/low chairs, very similar to those you see in child care places."

I was skeptical about their food at first, but was genuinely impressed with the authenticity and quality of their dim sum, unlike many other 'Chinese' restaurants in London. As good as the dim sum starters were, it was no where close to the matcha dessert I tried (yes, the one everyone seems to rave about). It was amazing, and no doubt I'm going again just for this. The Lychee Charlotte looks spectacular, but doesn't quite taste really good; far too sour for my liking. All-in-all, I definitely recommend this place for anyone! Good food, great service and even a bar (with a wide range of unique cocktails) makes it a winner in my book."

I know it is Chinese New Years but does the restaurant have to have an unannounced 20-30 minute long interruption with two unsmiling guys pounding on drums and banging their bells loudly?

But to hand over a place full of paying patrons to a bunch of crazies was a really bad idea.  We walked out of our (early) evening reservation as we had ordered wine and had been trapped, getting nothing served, while holding our fingers in our ears due to the noise!\nManagement blew it big time as I'm never setting foot inside the place and it used to be a favorite."

Here, it was actual pieces of vegetables and meats that you can see and distinguish...and taste! I would mark for 4 stars, but I felt that 3 pieces per dim sum for the price was a rip off. Also, when you order a pot of tea, you don't get hot water top up. Gotta pay for another (small) pot. Awesome. The ambiance was very nice. I'd say it has a better decor than Hakkasan.

They try to be very upscale in service, so they literally whisper at you...this only works if you're in a very quiet restaurant.  This place is more happening and upbeat which naturally turns into loud in volume.  You must speak up people!  They also need more training in being more observant...there were more than too many times they walked away without looking.  They probably solely get the Michelin for their food, because food is absolutely stunning in its presentation, quality, and taste.  The desserts are so pretty here too!\nThe two of us ordered the set menu for two people which came with the following:\n Blue swimmer crab salad with sesame dressing and Asian vegetables\n Venison Puff - flaky pastry filled with yummy venison.\n Seafood dumpling in supreme stock - Fish maw dumpling! So good! Great broth and exciting texture of the fish maw in the dumpling! \n Poached Peking chicken dumpling - Excellent\n Har gau - very nice skin with excellent shrimp inside\n Pork and prawn shui mai - Excellent\n Three style mushroom cheung fun - clean and woodsy mushroom taste with excellent skin!\n Fried chilli squid - So yummy!! Perfectly fried and little Thai chili peppers mixed in the loose batter gives it a good kick!!  There were also toasted coconuts which made it so fragrant and yummy!\n Crispy aromatic duck 1/4 - Quarter of a duck fried to perfection with inside meat juicy. The server shreds the meat for us so that we can make our own wrap.\n Chinese vegetable - crisp, sweet, excellent baby bok choy.\nThen two of my kids ordered additional from the a la cart menu:\n \n Lobster Dumpling - Lobster dumpling with tobiko caviar with ginger and shallot. Yes! They're yummy!\n Pork and preserved egg congee - really nice and well cooked.  Great flavor!\n Char Sui Bao - So good!  First note, you smell a fragrant but subtle rose.  Then you bite into this fluffy bun and taste the amazing char sui inside!  I asked why do I smell rose, and they told me that the flour they use is \"rose flour!\"  Amazing!!\n Scallop Siu Mai - Whole entire scallop per dumpling!  WOW!\nAfter all that food, we were stuffed, but we had to try the desserts, because they're sooooo beautiful!\n Raspberry and lychee rose - velvety and amazing!  Looks like a beautiful hat with a edible silver leaf on top!  Mmmmmm\n Green apple cake - so tangy and yummy and lovely!  Gelatin on top and buttery pie bottom.  The apple looks real!\n Chocolate orange macaron.  OK this is the only item that's not out of this world...only because I'm used to the finest...Ladur\u00e9e and Pierre Herme.  But still good.\nWe also had 4 pots of tea (there's no refill on water) and their pots are personal size, as well as 4 bottles of still water.\nThe bill was US $233, which's pretty steep for dim sum...but it was an experience to remember!"

My husband is allergic to sesame and nuts. The waiter straight-up told us we shouldn't even being dining there with when we have someone with nut and seed allergies. Some time later said waiter returned with about six items that we could order (out of a menu of perhaps a hundred). All of them were wonderful and delicious, but it was a little sad that those were the only items they could give us. The vast majority were vegetarian. On the same note, the only desserts we were able to have due to the allergy restriction were ice creams, which were wonderful but slightly disappointing with all the other wonderful things available.\nI really, really recommend Yauatcha-- but if you have a friend or family member with nut and/or seed allergies, maybe consider somewhere else."

The pork was decent, but nothing special. The ho fun at Yauatcha wasn't as good as places like Phoenix Palace or Gerrard's Corner. The chicken however was a revelation!

    "review": "I'd barely recovered from the sticker shock of Hakkasan when I was convinced to try its younger sibling, Yauatcha. I'd been told it was more focused on dim sum and was \"cheaper.\" Well, you can say that again. Pretty much anything's cheaper than Hakkasan. ;)\nI enjoyed catching up with an old roommate on a recent trip here, and unlike Hakkasan, I truly felt that the high quality and exquisite presentation did warrant the price premium and Michelin star. Yauatcha brings Western flair to traditional Chinese dim sum with gorgeous results. I mean that too, as I'm of Cantonese descent and I've had plenty of good dim sum in Hong Kong, mainland China, Canada, and the U.S. \nThe one dish that still sticks in my mind was the roasted duck pumpkin puff, which was almost too pretty to eat. It's a deep fried shell made to look exactly like a miniature pumpkin - complete with a tiny leaf - and it's packed full of flavorful roasted duck. \nYauatcha is also known for its macarons, and my friend got a takeaway box for his girlfriend. We didn't have any problems with service whatsoever, and all in all we had a pleasant time catching up. Definitely a place to try at least once if you're a dim sum connoisseur and your budget allows."

I was not expecting to come to London and enjoy the best Asian Fusion food I've ever had, but I did. Everyone in my group enjoyed their meal as just as much as I did and raved about it. \nThe restaurant itself is very trendy in terms of looks as well as clientele. It was exactly what I was looking for before a night on the town in London."

    "review": "For Chinese people, the concept of expensive fusion dim sum is a bit strange. Not to mention in general \u00a35 for an order of crab siu mai is a bit ridiculous.\nThe idea of venison puff pastry/pie at a Chinese restaurant is a bit strange, but we went for it. We also ordered the standard dishes - cheung fun (rice rolls), fried rice, siu mai, har gao etc. Some of the dishes were standouts such as the har gao/siu mai/turnip cake, but we were definitely let down by others. The noodles were greasy and bland, and the fried rice was burnt. \nService here is...unique. Transport Chinatown service to Soho and that's what you get. Not a single smile, exasperated looks thrown at me...not really sure what our table did to warrant it! We ended up having to send back the fried rice because parts of it were actually black at the bottom. We also had to wait over 20 minutes to get our dessert of glutinous rice balls covered with peanuts. When I asked one of the servers how long it would take, he told me it takes time. No kidding, I realised it takes time. Then I told him that we waited over 20 minutes for the dessert. He then gives me a quizzical look and questions me, unconvinced that I was telling the truth.\nBy this point, I was a bit fed up, so I just told him to cancel the order. I guess we attracted enough attention because five minutes later the manager comes up with a plate of macarons for us, \"on the house\". With the exception of the chocolate macaron, the four of us all agreed that they were too sweet, stuck to our teeth, and we couldn't even discern what the flavours were supposed to be. \nI've been to Yauatcha on previous occasions, and there was not a single occasion where the service was acceptable. Really good quality dim sum but I have no choice but to take points off for burnt rice, and the repeatedly rude servers."

    "review": "Posh Dim Sum. It's a bit of a weird concept to get your mind around, like Richie Rich having a McD's in his mansion. Dim sum for me as always been that lazy, slightly hungover, still in pajamas, meal that I'd dragged myself out of bed for on a way to sunny Sunday. Although, now that I've grown up and somewhat matured in the last 5 years from college, I suppose posh dim sum shouldn't be that surprising.\nAnyways, on to the place itself. Two floors, both classy, the top being probably better for brunches due to the natural light whereas the lower ground has a starry sky effect ceiling which I could see be perfect for late night drinks or a date. The top floor does have the benefit of the dessert and pastry bar which has some truly mouth watering options on display (which unfortunately I couldn't have as I gave up desserts for Lent). \nWe were downstairs this time, and quickly seated by an attractive hostess in a very comfortable booth. Given that I had cycled 40 miles before noon, the soft cushioning was a very welcome feeling to my sore buttocks. Tap water was requested and quickly received. I think it says something about the high standard to which a place holds itself when even the tap water is served in an elegant stemless flute, perfectly chilled but not cold, with a lemon garnish. They have a selection of teas and smoothies along with an interesting cocktail list. I opted for a lime and passionfruit jasmine iced tea which I could have happily sipped all day except for the fact my glass ran out and I was too busy fighting for food (it's still dim sum no matter how posh) to order another one.\nFoodwise, everything was tasty but a few things stood out. The char siu bun (roast bbq pork in a slightly sweet steamed bun) was delightful with rich tender pork in a sticky bbq sauce stuffed inside a bun so light it was like eating a cloud...filled with meat. The pork and preserved egg congee was a great comfort food and made me want to make a massive batch for myself (must add it to the weekend plans) although it was just a tad too bland (even for congee). We had the usual array of prawn and pork dumplings. They were good, but nothing to brag about. The scallop dumplings were terrible as the scallops were far too overcooked so I wouldn't recommend that.\nAs most reviews indicate, the venison puffs are another quality dish. The meat filling is good, but the value is in the sweet puff pastry that surrounds it. It seems a bit odd, but the combination of the gamey venison and the sweet flaky pastry is brilliant. I wonder if I could make it by adding honey to regular puff pastry?\nThe final winner was the jasmine tea smoked spare ribs. The ribs were cooked to perfection and the meat literally fell off the bones. The sticky hoisin and bbq sauce was literally fingerlickin' good and the tea added a mild smokiness to the dish that demands to be added to anyone's bbq repertoire.\nOther thoughts...hmmm let's see. The waitstaff are interesting and it's a bit hit or miss if you get a good one or one you can barely communicate with. The majority speak fluent Chinese (which is helpful when you have a Chinese speaker who can order) and that's always a good thing in a dim sum joint. They have a weird policy where only your waiter/waitress can serve the food from the tray to table so you may have a few minutes where you can see your food next to the table but they won't give it to you. Pricewise, it's expensive (I paid \u00a338 and wasn't left hungry but not stuffed as usual either) and only about half the dishes seemed worth the price. I'm hard pressed to say this would be a better dim sum spot than Ping Pong's \u00a320 all you can eat deal on Sundays, but it's a place to treat yourself to some unusual items."

This is a beautiful restaurant,  a space that welcomes you on both levels,  the top floor has a shared eating area with a gorgeous sweets display,  featuring macarons,  layered deserts and chocolates.... Very impressive. \nOrchids are displayed through out,  Yauatcha has many interesting features and the beautiful fish tanks are used in away that compliments the decor. \nSadly... The glory of Yauatcha stops there. The pricing of the food is fair but portion sizes are quite random. The service.... On this occasion.... Terrible... We waited 25 minutes before asking the manager (who caught the bewildered expression we had on our faces) for a drink as we hadn't seen our waiter since being seated. The manager was very attentive and made a true effort to correct our waiter who clearly was failing to service his section. We noticed tables around us were also waiting,  and recieving their meals in random orders and feeling.... Like us.... Abandoned.... \nDefinitely unacceptable for a Michelin Star Restaurant. \nThe food.... \nThe food was good but not great, but I think the service had affected this side being appreciated like it should have been. As I said the food is fairly priced although some food items are heavily hiked for what you get. \nAll in all I'm not sure if I should be so hard as to say we didn't enjoy ourselves. We appreciated the friendly attentive staff who ushered us to our table,  the trendy decor, the innovative ice teas on offer and the food was acceptable but it wasn't mind blowing.

    "review": "Awful from head to toe. How are you even related to Hakkasan? More importantly, how do people rate you so highly?\nThe short version: chaotic mess of a service, blaring music, Wagamama-level food.\nThe longer version: We arrived a couple minutes early for 8pm reservations for my birthday. There was already a queue--of people who had reservations. We waited 40min to be seated, and meanwhile there was no place to sit, no bar, no apology, just a harried-looking man at the front desk looking panicked.\nThe waitress who took us down plowed ahead at speed, clearly feeling rushed; forget the fact that heels + slippery stone stairs down into the basement =/= me sprinting after you, lady. She essentially abandoned us at our table, leaving us to find the coat check ourselves.\nWhile the upstairs is fairly quiet and chill, the basement is like a bad nightclub. The music was so loud and so repetitive in its beat (imagine the stereotypical nightclub scene from the last show you watched: it was like that) that we couldn't hear our waiter. The seats are super low; neither of us is particularly tall, but we felt like we had our knees up to our chests and were sitting in kiddy seats.\nWhen our waiter finally found us, it was to plunk down the chintzy-looking vinyl-bound menus and run off to see to another table. The menu had plenty of overlap with Hakkasan, so we were fairly hopeful that the quality would be similar, especially since (if I'm not mistaken) it's Yauatcha which has the Michelin star. The waiter kept cutting me off, and so my partner ended up ordering everything. Forget asking questions; he either didn't know the answer or couldn't be bothered to find out.\nThe first cocktail tasted like turpentine, and the waiter apparently had a hard time understanding why it was a problem. It wasn't a matter of a cocktail that wasn't to someone's taste; it tasted like pure (and cheap) vodka rather than something that cost as much as a main.\nOnce that was (begrudgingly) replaced, the appetisers started to show up. Everything was decidedly lacklustre, and we kept comparing the dishes to their parallels at Hakkasan--an easy thing to do considering that many of the dishes literally just had ingredients swapped out (ie, duck 'pumpkins' vs lamb 'pears'). Our food arrived fairly fast, but was shoved onto the tiny table in a haphazard fashion, and someone placed the hot teapot right within easy burning distance (and knocking-over distance) of my elbow, meaning I had to kept avoiding it.\nForget getting our waiter's attention for anything: he was too busy juggling six other tables, carving duck tableside, etc. By the time we managed to catch his eye, we were informed that half of the desserts were gone as options and we were pretty much over the ridiculous noise of the place: screaming at each other to be heard is really not how I anticipated spending my birthday evening.\nI really, really wish that the Michelin rating of this place was revisited, because not a single part of our experience warranted a two-star rating on Yelp, much less a Michelin star. And the price they charge for this sub-par /everything/ is down-right embarrassing.\nIf you want faux Chinese food, noise, and dismissive service, go to Wagamama and save yourself a hundred quid.\nOh, and as a bonus, we got to watch a fish dying slowly on its side at the top of the bar-side tank. PETA would have had a ball."

People have come from outside just to get the takeaway desserts."

We ordered five dishes: the char siu bao, lo bak go (or turnip cake), duck/pumpkin puff, crab salad, and prawn and beancurd cheung fun. The char siu bao were amazing, best I've ever had. The duck/pumpkin puff may have been the standout of the night, and those two along with the cheung fun rounded out the top three. The lo bak go was made a bit differently than I'm accustomed to - it had a layer of spring onion and I guess egg over the part you expect. Not bad, but I'll stick with what I'm used to on that one. The swimmer crab salad was nice with mushrooms but probably not worth \u00a311. Desserts all looked great, my friend picked the chocolate pebble and I confess I was slightly underwhelmed. I chose a couple of macarons that were outstanding - esp the mango/passionfruit. Service was great, price was bearable but certainly a rare treat."

They were distinctly dim sum  but not like the standard menu item I'm accustomed to at a typical restaurant.

One bite of this little parcel didn't take me back to a different time or place, instead it created its own unique experience. \nYauatcha describes itself as a dim sum teahouse but I have only known it for its beautifully designed desserts (it's hard to miss their display of carefully lined goods that welcome you into the restaurant as you enter). This time around we came for lunch as I was curious to sample Michelin star dim sum.\nIt came at a price.  For \u00a3125 we also sampled lobster dumplings with tobiko caviar, king crab dumplings, striploin beef with enoki mushroom cherng fun, spicy pork Szechuan wonton, sweet potato mushroom mei-si rolls, two pots of tea and sake.

Don't order the Halibut - too fishy. \nGranted, I am in a unique position to eat dim sum at great places which are a small fraction of the price but when in London, I would say find another place to eat.\nI know London is different from many cities but I was not impressed by the service either.

The pork belly with truffle was super super fatty. The crispy aromatic duck was really dry. The macarons are to die for. I tried the toasted rice, pistachio, passion fruit and the caramel. All very good."

    "review": "I don't like giving out bad reviews, but this place offers overpriced mediocre and very disappointing. With one michelin star and all, you would think you can get something special here. I had Har Gau, Prawn and bean curd Chaung-fen, and Spinach cuttlefish & prawn balls. It added up to 22.58 pounds (including a 13% service charge and a 1 pound donation to a certain foundation that I know nothing about.)\nThe food was over salted in general and the skin of the Har Gau broke as soon as my chopsticks touched it. The Chaung-fen was nothing special.\nThe most ridiculous part? I couldn't finish my Chaung-fen so I asked the waitress if she could box the left-over and she said the restaurant does not allow their diners to box the leftovers. If it's a buffet, fine. But when a client has already paid for the food, you'd rather see it go to waste than have the client take it home? That logic is completely bulls. \nI asked for my change and put every penny back into my wallet. Definitely won't come back again. In the future, I'd rather spend that amount of money on a decent steak at Jamie's Italian."

And then I came home to Engerland and was all \"show me the dimsum\" and some people did but they were wrong. WRONG.  It wasn't proper dimsum.  It was stupid.  I didn't like it.  And then my boss took me to Yauatcha and I was all . . . what is this?  Amaze.  They've got turnip cakes and chicken feet.  But it's POSH.  This is culinary mentalness on a whole other level where the level is one of joy in my mouth.\nI used to think that all they served was cakes cos that's what they have in the windows - you know, those well pricey macaroons and stuff - and the windows are fully glass and blue (like, bright blue) and it looks Expensive and it is.  But dimsum - well, it ain't cheap, not even in China (where I lived), depending on who's paying, so you can't really go with an empty purse or expect to skimp and still get the good bits.  It's not peasant food, like beef and tomatoes or special fried rice (which are nice too but not in the same way).  Still you get used to seeing the same old crap in Chinatown and some of that's here but this is the Good Stuff, like stuff from China, the original stuff.\nYeah, the starry-ceilinged downstairs with background reed flute music harks of Chessington World of Adventures and the bathroom is very S&M dungeon (with Aesop hand-soap) and the tables are so low that the waiters can't hear when you order, but blimey is the food tasty.\nI've always been too full after stuffing my face with dimsum and a main course (it's not how they do it in China, WHERE I LIVED, but when the boss is paying, you do what you're told) so I've never had a pudding, but they look utterly epic.  One day I will.  Somebody take me to Yauatcha and buy me a macaroon, won't you?  And I'll order the dimsum since I know these things (from when I lived in China) so everyone's a winner.\nThe oolong tea costs \u00a38.  Don't order it."

We were being treated by a regular who steered us towards some of his Dim Sum favourites and we were rewarded with classics like a moist and savoury Char Sui Bao, the most perfect jasmine smoked ribs and some surprising but delicious 'venison balls'. \nLess awe-inspiring ,but all the while excellently executed, were the prawn and mango crispy parcels, the singapore and mushroom dumplings, but the pumpkin dumplings and superlative soft shell crab (you simply must order it) made up for it. \nThe proof being in the pudding, the dessert here was always going to be outstanding. I'm glad to say we were not disappointed when we tucked in to our choices. Sometimes pretty asian versions of French pastries can be a delight to behold but a little disappointing on the tongue, not so at Yauatcha - everything we tasted was exquisite, as well as photogenic. So much so that we bought more to take away for 'tomorrow'...or maybe just a midnight snack!\nOh you should also seek out the mandarine and spicy chili fruit juice in the drinks menu - lip-smackingly good!"

If you make a reservation and that is quiet necessary, ask for a table downstairs and then preferably for table 21( for 2 persons), table 16 or 20(both for 6 to 8 persons). From these tables you have a lovely view into the kitchen. Start your evening at the bar and try out one of their delicious cocktails. We, as non alcohol drinkers, tried the lime-cucumber-yasmin ice tea. Devine drink.\nFrom the dinning menu we tried and shared the following dishes; lobster dumpling with tobiko caviar, spinach ball with prawn and cuttlefish, steamed king crab roll, fried chili squid, crispy duck roll, hot&sour soup with trumpet mushrooms and our absolute favorite of the evening ; spicy aubergine with sato beans, okra and french beans with peanut. What a treat! And last but not least, the deserts are finger licking good. You can also go there for lunch or make a reservation for their outstanding high tea."

I was skeptical that any dim sum restaurant could be michelin-rated. Dim sum is dim sum. Boy was I wrong...\nWe arrived early for our reservation. After standing around for a few minutes, they took us to a table downstairs. The place was packed. I started with a peach tea smoothie. Yummy, but nothing I haven't had before. Then the food started arriving.\nFirst up, spicy szechuan wontons. One bite into the thing and I was convinced. Dim sum is not just dim sum. After we ate the wontons, my husband proceeded to lick up the spicy sauce. \nNext was the pan-fried turnip cake. I didn't even order this - I ordered the pan-fried taro cake but my American accent must have tripped them up. Oh well, I ate it anyway. And boy was I glad I did. This thing was awesome! It was pan-fried with eggs and chives (or scallions?). Mmmm...best mistake ever. \nWhile everything was good, those were the two dishes that really stuck out at me. Other things we had - crispy duck roll (kind of disappointing), prawn cheung fun (good but not that different from other dim sum places), sticky rice in lotus leaf (good but, like the cheung fun, it was similar to what you'd get at other dim sum places), poached peking dumpling (spicy but delicious), spring onion puff (good, not great). I can't remember what else. \nThen came the egg white and salted fish fried rice. This was a bowl of deliciousness. I still crave this. After all of this, we were stuffed. But we ordered some more szechuan wontons anyway. My husband complained about being too full but drank all the sauce again anyway. \nI'm kind of bummed we didn't try more stuff from the menu. I love dim sum and Yauatcha was a nice surprise."

I made reservation for 2:30, they made us wait near the entrance where kids and strollers are running around all over the place. Stressed out with low blood sugar level, it was a bad start to begin with.\nTo the menu. I saw guotie (potstickers) on the menu, it was a chinese wait staff so I spoke in Chinese. and she repeated my order saying that it's steamed dumplings. I was like guotie HAS to be fried. that's the meaning of the words. She pointed to the english translation that it's steamed. If that's the case the chinese name should've been jiaozi  definitely NOT guotie .\nTo the hongyouchaushou  . It's a shanghainese dish and shanghainese dumpling wrappers are different from the cantonese ones. Ours are made with just white flour. The fact that they used Cantonese dumpling wrapper for my hongyouchaushou   is borderline offensive.\nOverall the quality of the food wasn't that great. I much prefer Shanghai Blues for similar price and much better ambience. The bill took forever to come and the place is just poorly organized. I'm glad that I tried it and checked it off the list but probably won't go back there again."

Have had more expensive meals in Chinatown in a less pleasant atmosphere. \nIt was my birthday and they brought a complimentary plate of macarons and a candle.  Nice touch\nOne star off for the service, I had booked at 830pm and we had to wait in the entrance for 30min so our table would be ready.

    "review": "Is memory playing tricks , or are standards slipping here ?\n A recent Saturday lunch here was marred by a few things. First, the reduced size of the menu ( relative to days of yore, circa 2009), means that some of the \"wow\" factor dishes have disappeared. I lament, in particular, the passing of the salt-and-pepper quail. The venison puffs , which used to be so ethereal, are now merely nice. Worse still, some dishes I swear could have come from any one of a dozen places in Chinatown - pleasant, but wholly undistinguished.\n The drinks, as has been noted, are something of a stitch up - no mid-range sake, for example, only the cloudy version ( which comes in an effete pink bottle fit for Barbie and Ken, and can only be drunk cold). Brief discussion of the situation with staff suggested that they were pretty clueless on this score - not actually their fault if the leadership is not educating them.\n Saving graces ? Well the macaroons are still gorgeous, and the (much reduced) dessert menu does offer delights such as the Coconut Charlotte, so light and otherworldly I'd imagine it's the kind of thing angels eat as a holiday treat. The people inside are much prettier than in your average central London dim sum factory. It's not the place to come, perhaps, for a slap-up feed, but you'll be aware that you could have had something 75 % as good for 50% of the price elsewhere."

It then took considerably longer for them to serve us our desserts and tea, which is the only thing we ordered. When it came to paying we asked for the bill 3 times and it never came, and it was only when we got up and went to what looked like the manager that we got our bill, obviously with an 'optional' service charge already included.\nWe also wanted to buy some sweets to take away but that took absolutely ages too, despite me going behind the counter and actually jumping up and down to try and attract their attention.\nThe only redemption was that the same person who looked like the manager didn't charge for some of the chocolates, but I think that's actually because he was just trying to be nice to my lady friend (who is of course, a hottie)!\nAnnoyingly though, I will have to return to try the dim sum because of all the other badass reviews saying how great it is!"

Our evening there was a mix of good and bad, so this is why I have given it an average rating.\nWhen I make a booking at a restaurant for 8pm, I expect to be seated at the table when I turn up on time.  Instead, we were waiting at the bar for half an hour before our table was ready.  If they are intending for you to buy drinks at the bar before your meal, then I feel they should have a no reservations policy.  When I made the booking, they told me that I would need to vacate the table by 10pm.  Fortunately this wasn't an issue for us tonight.\nThe restaurant is pretty loud and it didn't help that the tables were so close together.  I think this is a trendy restaurant.  There were a few parties of friends who had come for drinks and to try the nice-looking desserts.\nNotwithstanding all this, I thought the dishes were excellent.  We got 8 dishes for dinner, a dessert each and a pot of jasmine tea (and a refill).  The prices ranged from \u00a34.60 for a plate of 3 venison puffs to \u00a313.50 for a plate of jasmine ribs.

Also try the crispy duck salad, is really tasty.\nAs main, there is only one option for me: the crispy duck! It is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, litteraly my flatmate and me have been addicted to it for months last winter...it is tasty, the meat is tender, the sauce is great, pancakes are good...the best main you can have here. All the other stuff are pretty good too, but this one deverves to be tried at least once. \nYou might think that Asian places don't serve good desserts, but here you have some delicious ones: my favourite is the Coconut Charlotte, but also the chocolate delice is very good. \nThere are some very nice cocktails as well, fruity and colourful, and a good wine selection, even if I always end up taking the asian beer (I think Sapporo is the one I like better).\nThe place is very nice, the street level floor is elegant and clean, but the best part is the lower ground floor with a blue lighting and a huge acquarium at the bar: Since the first time I came, I felt like to be in a \"movie restaurant\", the places where the characters usually meet for a date or a chat in the movies.\nThe only problem is that it is so popular these days that finding a table and even making a reservation is a nightmare, over the weekend tables are booked since mid week! They offer various time slots, at 6.30, 8.30 and 10.30 for dinner and if you are lucky and call on the same day you can find something at 6.30 only...\nI can't wait to go back to London to come here again!"

Time Out had raved about Yauatcha, so we decided to check it out (yes shame on me, i should stay true to Yelp for recommendations). \nWe stepped into a gorgeous restaurant surrounded with decadent deserts and modern chinese decor. We were promptly seated downstairs (next to the bar which also acts as a fish tank, amazing). \nNot sure what to order, we shared steamed chicken dumplings, grilled vegetable dumplings and beef ho fun noodles. The food was served quickly and was simply the best i've eaten in a while. I also had a lime and passion fruit ice tea which washed it all down nicely. All together the meal was \u00a315 each including drinks which i think is a reasonable amount for a lunch date. It is on the more pricey side but it's really not surprising considering Yauatcha has a Michelin star, well deserved too. \nHighly recommended. I'm saving my pennies for my next round of dim sum."

    "review": "My first visit to Yauatcha was more than 7 years ago when Londoners were yet to get their fair share of upscale Chinese food.  Dim sum lunch was usually taken hastily in one of the tacky eateries in China Town and there was almost no place offering authentic Chinese cuisines and western standard service and decor. Against that backdrop, Yauatcha was an easy standout.  I was particularly impressed with the quality of the dim sum.  Coming from Hong Kong, where one can get quality dim sum aplenty, I was always skeptical of these new age chinese restaurants but Yauatcha was the rare few that delivered quality with just the right amount of innovation that justified the steeper prices it fetched.  \nTimes have changed though but my recent visits to Yauatcha have been disappointing.  First off, food was still of consistent quality. My favorites include the venison puff (venison in a slightly sweet puff pastry case where in the usual case it would have been bbq pork), the three style mushroom cheung fun (a steamed rice roll stuffed with mushroom) and the jasmine tea smoked rib. There is also a good selection of tea and desserts.  However, there are multiple things that were problematic. First and foremost, service was slow and inattentive, and frequently I seem to get the \"dont-seem-to-care-less\" attitude from everyone working there.  Friends have received the same treatment. Just not the kind of service you would expect at this price point.  The interiors also look a bit worn and old now, maybe time for some touchups?  If you want quality dimsum at reasonable prices, you are better off going to one of the Royal China's around town.  And if fusion is what you like, there are plenty of choices around. One good thing though is that you can always get a table at Yauatcha, if you have the cash and time to spare."

    "review": "This is a fantastic place if you are going on a date or having a business meeting but terrible if you are planning on having a meal with your family. My parents wanted to go for dim sum and I thought of trying somewhere new so a friend recommended Yauatcha after reading raving reviews about it on Yelp.\nEverything about this restaurant screams modern and trendy from the design of the menu to the ambiance. Looking at the restaurant from the outside in, you would have thought it to be a cafe to enjoy a hot beverages with  a variety of desserts. Traditional would not be a word that I would use to describe this establishment. Even Debussy, Clair de Lune that was playing in the background was given an upbeat electronic remix. I didn't mind the music as I thought it was fitting to the surroundings but I really didn't like the seats. I am about 180cm tall (5'9\") and found the seats to be awkward and uncomfortable to sit in as the chairs seemed to be lower to the ground than usual. \nAnyway we order a selection of dim sum and waited for out food to arrive. The dim sum was good but not amazing especially when you factor in the price. In comparison to a typical Chinese restaurant in China town that severs dim sum, you are paying anything between \u00a33 to \u00a35 more. Safe to say that you are paying extra for the aesthetics appeal. It is also worth noting that you don't get free refills of the Jasmin tea. So overall I would say I prefer dining at more traditional Chinese restaurant than a modernised one hence the 3 star ranking that I gave but whenever I need to wine and dine some one then this would be one of the places that I would consider bringing them to."

A week ago I visited with 2 friends without a reservations and we were escorted to a table behind the staircase adjacent to a register being actively used by multiple waiters. After we received our drinks we were bumped repeatedly and asked to be reseated. The manager was very gracious about moving us to a table in the larger downstairs room with a view of the huge fish tank. Dinner proceeded uneventfully and we enjoyed our meals. Tonight visited the restaurant with friends who had not been there before but this time I called to make a reservation and asked to be seated in the large room with a view of the fish tank. I was really surprised when we were seated at the exact table behind the stairs I had been given a week earlier. This time I immediately asked for another table and told them I was assured that there would be no problem sitting in the large dining room. We sat a short while and then were given another table by the kitchen but improved. \nThen came issues with the service. We received one of our appetizers. Then we received another. Then we got our three meals. We finished them and Then we received another appetizer. Then we requested the bill and then along with the bill came soup we had ordered earlier. We thought the late appetizer and soup had been forgotten. Then as we were paying my one friend said \"there is a bug in my beer\"  I looked and saw a sizable live bug waving around in the beer. I wondered how many might have been in my meal. We won't go back."

I didn't really feel the price premium was proportional to the improvement in taste or quality over more typical dim sum restaurants.  I ordered the spicy pork dumplings, which were not really spicy and the pork filling didn't have a lot of flavor.  The three mushroom cheung fun was probably my favorite.  The roasted duck pumpkin puff was very cute in the way it was presented, but I didn't think the combination was the best texturally inside the fried rice exterior.\nAll in all, I think the price premium is mostly for the atmosphere and not necessarily for better food quality."

    "review": "Going to Yauatcha was an exciting prospect after hearing so much about the restaurant. The experience did not disappoint. Dining at Yauatcha is an adventure. I really liked the ambience of the restaurant downstairs. There are enclaves in the walls with electric candles so the room is dark but candlelit. There is a long acquarium strip with fish brightly lit on the customer facing side of the bar. My date for the evening suggested that the noise from the music might be a problem for some diners, but it wasnt for us. In fact I enjoyed the level of noise as it gave us some privacy and also added to the ambience of the room. You can see the kitchen through frosted glass so you get a sense of how fast things are moving in the kitchen, which makes sense because the service is excellent 5/5. We ordered mushroom dim sum and prawn shui mai with chicken to begin with and these were served seamlessly right after one another. Next we were served crispy aromatic duck with pancakes and hoisin sauce. Again the service was elegant and prompt. After this we ordered egg fried rice and kung pao chicken which was excellent. The chicken was delicious and I could have eaten much more! The chilies were quite hot but not too hot to eat, apart from one. For dessert I resisted my primary urge to order the maccarons and instead ordered the chocolate pebble which was enjoyable. I could see that a lot of thought had gone into the dessert's construction and different textures as you might expect from this Michelin starred restaurant. However for me the dessert was not outstanding nor delicious. I am certainly a fan of Yauatcha and can't wait to visit again! I can see why it has earned its Michelin star as I found eating there an adventure and a delight."

Now, having tried Hakkasan I didn't really have high hopes, but it rocked my taste buds to the core.\nWe usually go for dim sum (lunch) and have on occasion been for dinner. Between three of us we order about 10 dishes and drinks which only comes out to about \u00a325 each. Some may think that is extortionate for dim sum, but how many places my friend, can you get perfect venison -melt-in-you-mouth pastry puffs? None. I've seen that Royal China have tried to add them to their menu - but they just cannot compete.\nOther dishes we order frequently are the pork and chive dumplings, shanghai soup dumplings and all other regulars, think pork buns, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf etc. I have to admit I come here about once or twice a month, that is how much I love it. Service used to be a lot worse but I've seen some improvement in their waiting staff. The hostesses on the other hand could be a little friendlier. \nI also like, that unlike Royal China, you can make a booking and not have to show up at 11am on a Saturday morning just to get a table.

Each time I've been there, I've sat downstairs, where the tables are packed in, but it still doesn't seem crowded or uncomfortable.\nThe best food on the menu is the dim sum (the steamed mushroom dumplings are to die for, and I love the venison puffs), though there are larger Asian dishes and curries if you fancy something more hearty. Make sure you have a dessert as well. I had a ginger and white chocolate cheesecake that knocked me for six for a while as I floated away in a pudding-induced daydream.\nThe waiters do a fantastic job of recommending dishes if you're unsure (the first lunch I had here, one of the guys just brought us a selection of their best dishes and man, it was good).\nNot exactly cheap (I could probably get just-as-good dim sum at Ping Pong - which I prefer as a destination), you're paying again for the place itself.

They were kind enough to warn me up front, and without asking that the chili oil was not vegetarian since it contained fish sauce.  If you've eaten at Yank Sing in SF, you will find this Yauatcha to be of similar quality with a better beverage selection and modern decor.  Definitely worth another visit."

Decor and atmosphere was on the too painfully hip side of things, especially in the loungy downstairs room where we were seated. Low tables and low padded chairs felt a bit like sitting at the kiddy table. Otherwise, I suppose you are getting your money's worth, as the tab will reflect the quality of the surroundings ;)\nThe large menu of overly flowery, fruity, asian-themed cocktails seemed to highlight their mixologists' importance, but didn't interest me much, especially at 9 quid a drink, but what do I know, the young gals at the other tables were having quite a few.\nWell, the eats - dim sum and other Chinese dishes were executed quite well, with authentic, distinct and varied flavors. A number of interesting and unique variations on dim sum were pretty good, especially fried and pastry items, like duck pumpkin puff. Haute dim sum, I suppose. Didn't have dessert, but after reading other reviews, glad I didn't, as it seemed they used to do much better sweets. On the way out spied some plated asian BBQ short ribs in the kitchen that looked tasty, we missed out perhaps?\nAlmost 4 stars, but quite average service and the steep prices keep me from getting all the way there. Plus, I was getting such a pre-recession posh vibe from this joint, for dim sum and Chinese food, of all things, but maybe that's just me."

My first visit a few years back, I booked a table and still ended up sitting on a large round table with a few other couples, which was fine, but I did want my own table, especially as I booked.\nThe d\u00e9cor is modern with massive fish tanks and black marble floors. The service is typically first class by the Japanese and the food is exquisite, on my last visit I had venison puffs, which were great, Ostridge dumplings, great! I didn't like the whole fish I ordered, which was haddock, at \u00a330! The spicey squid and rice sticks were delish. They have a great dim sum too. Everything is expensive but you will definitely attentively waited and the food will be great. \nOne downside is that on my last visit, me and two friends booked a table, but we still had to wait 20 minutes or so, they gave us the menus so we could get ahead of the game, and I didn't really like that, they really are so busy. \nOn leaving the restaurant, you can buy some goodies or teas and herbs to take home, the shop is right next to the exit as if it were a museum, but they do have some nice deserts to take home."

Walked in around 6pm on a rainy Sunday evening and were seated only after some fuss and the promise to leave within an hour and a half despite many empty seats available.\nNext, ordered two appetizers, but the waiter (who didn't seem to understand English well enough to not mess things up) brough three - one of which we had not ordered. He didn't apologize or offer to take it back. All three appetizers were underwhelming: chicken steamed shu mai, pork buns and something else we had not ordered. Greasy and not particularly great flavors.\nWe then ordered fried rice with long beans, which for ten pounds I expected would be delicious, but was greasy and tasteless. Beef in black bean sauce - greasy and chewy. \nWe took a couple of bites but didn't want anymore of it so asked if it could be packed to take away. They said no- they don't pack food to take away.\nOverall a very very underwhelming, over priced experience with cold staff. Would not return."

    "review": "About a year ago I was at Yauatcha with some friends, and someone got to wondering whether Yauatcha had ever had a Michelin star.  There was some disagreement (some thought it still had a star), so we eventually asked a waiter who, after leaving to consult colleagues, eventually returned with the news that at that moment, Yauatcha was still the holder of one star, but that it was uncertain whether this situation would continue for much longer!  Evidently the fate of the restaurant did not rest with that curiously pessimistic member of staff, for the 2010 list is now out, and Yauatcha still has its star.\nI revisited a few days ago, and whilst Yauatcha is perhaps not the restaurant is once was, it's still got some pretty good moves.  The dim sum is some of the best in London, and whilst not cheap, it can be surprisingly good value: it's very much possible to drink tea and eat well for \u00a325, which is perhaps \u00a310 more than an acceptable dim sum you might get somewhere else.  (I've only ever eaten dim sum at Yauatcha; other dishes will be more expensive.)\nThe food is recognisably traditional, though with a few twists--venison might replace beef, for example.  The presentation is pretty good, even for menu items that sound uninspiring.  Dim sum is not for the truly timid, but although chicken feet are on the menu, there's plenty of safe dumplings and ribs and buns, etc. to be had.  The mushroom cheung fun (mushroom wrapped in a loose noodle sheath) is close to twice the price of the meat and seafood variations, but well worth it.  The deep fried squid was also excellent.\nThe decor is nice and staff are pleasant.  Neither is intimidating.  It can be noisy, and isn't suited for long, lingering meals.  As other reviews have mentioned, the dramatic cake display upstairs has disappeared--a loss.\nFour stars--I'm a fan, and I'll be back."

    "review": "I have eaten at better restaurants, I have eaten better dim sum, I have had better service. But somehow this restaurant still gets 5 stars because I always come out feeling like I've had the loveliest treat ever. The quality of the teas (and tea cocktails), the beauty of the dim sum, the ritual of it all, and the fish and flowers.\n Yauatcha is a hybrid of a swanky dim sum restaurant and a very posh tea house. Although it's possible to eat dim sum upstairs, the restaurant is technically downstairs, and tea and cake upstairs. The two are very different in character; upstairs is light and airy and downstairs is dark and sexy.\n When you book to eat, you can choose upstairs or downstairs. Evening meals go downstairs, light snacks, afternoon tea, upstairs. You cannot choose the exact spot when you book, however I recommend once you get there that you specify you would like to sit in the main section downstairs, not around the side. In fact you should insist upon this, and prepare to wait a bit longer. Although this may be a hassle, you will enjoy it far more, I promise.\n As a reasonably critical person who has visited Yauatcha countless times over the last six years, which is akin to giving the place spot checks throughout its history, I can say one thing: Yauatcha is consistent. As such it's a great place to entertain friends, treat clients, or take one's partner.\n The style of decor, food, and service treads that fine line between being suitable for business and for romance. One can equally bring one's glamorous Persian girlfriend here late on a Friday night, and one's aging mother for a Sunday afternoon tea. (Currently one has the latter, not the former...)\n You may find the front of house snooty. Personally I love it. I don't want to be greeted and subsequently ignored by anyone other than the impossibly (I'm not allowed to say \"pathologically\" am I? No) slim, beautiful girls who do it so brilliantly. I like my FOH efficient, with that edge of slight disdain that says \"you do realise where you are, don't you?\"\n The dim sum is inventive and seasonal, the ingredients are fresh. The menu has naturally changed over the last few years but the favourites still exist to this day; the Baked Venison Puff is a must, although the venison is a little more stodgy than it used to be but the pastry has got even better. Sadly the shark fin soup appears to be off the menu - it's probably best though, isn't it? Oh and I love the latest (Autumn 2010?) addition of the Crystal Dumplings - lovely little translucent steamed things stuffed with pumpkin and pine nut. The Lotus Leaf Rice is another simple, well-executed crowd-pleaser. Mooli puffs are fun little creatures to behold, they are vegetable dumplings with a pastry exterior rolled into the exact shape (and presumably dyed to the same colour) as a little carrot, with some spinach coming out the top. This is high-end-pastry-chef-meets-Roger-Rabbit and I heartily approve.\n It's a terrible shame their cake counter has been replaced. Yauatcha staff say this is because the cake chef left in Autumn 2009. Oh, the gold-flecked chocolate ganaches - I mourn their passing. (I'm not serious. Actually no yes I am.) Nevertheless the macaroons are still great.\n The downstairs decor is stunning. You know how some people, when they walk out of the house, they put on a suit and look smart, at all times? Even if they put on a bit of a shabby jacket, they still look ridiculously hot? The interior decor of Yauatcha is that person. It could never become a bit tatty, because it's so hot in the first place. The tropical fish and the flower displays are very special indeed. Music is ambient and always at the perfect level for conversation, and the restaurant's acoustic allows it to become quite lively when busy, but never too loud. It has a lovely bustly feel, but I never get offended by loud groups here. (I usually hate loud groups.)\n I personally love to enjoy food at Yauatcha on a Sunday afternoon, post-lunch, when the service is relaxed and the downstairs restaurant is quiet.\n I'm sure it's possible to bring children, but really it's not that kind of place - in case you hadn't guessed. Personally I find it nice to get away from restaurants (especially Sunday afternoons!) that are brimming with prams and cots and toys and screams.\n Oh, and the bill? It's not pricey especially compared to a number of notably inferior chain dim sum restaurants I could name (some are very nearby...)\n It caters for all appetites and tastes in food. You simply can't go wrong. Go!"

They just look so perfect and colourful and full of flavour. These are served on the ground floor and many people come for takeaway.\nThe other part to Yauatcha is a high-class (and expensive!) dim sum restaurant on the ground floor. Routine dishes are given a lift with exotic ingredients like venison and even gold leaf. Lovely to eat. Expensive ingredients make it better? Debatable I think.\nSo a solid 4 stars - lovely experience but heavy on the wallet."

    "review": "For pics see Greedy Diva @ \ngreedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026\n \n Sometimes, when one needs comfort food on a lazy Sunday afternoon, only dim sum will do. And as if to prove that comfort and style need not be mutually exclusive, there's Yauatcha. (There's also my new Massimo Dutti heels, the mildly glam-in-an-officey-way exterior of which belies a sensible, I'm-on-the-wrong-side-of-30, cushioned inner sole. But I digress.)\n Yauatcha is a modern dim sum tea house with a refined air and a Michelin Star held firmly between its chopsticks. Formerly owned by Alan Yau, it proves to be surprisingly good value (say, around \u00a325 per head) - particularly if you stick to dim sum and tea. Although I caution that the bill does start to stack up if you opt for larger dishes and wine.\n The ground level, where we enjoy our lunch time dim sum, feels bright and fresh, with shades of blue and a large fish tank lining the entrance. Downstairs, is more dimly lit and clandestine - a popular option for the evening crowd.\n We start with some roasted blue tea, the Fuijan Wuyi Yan, Shui Xian (\u00a34 per pot), which we chose on the basis that other options are more expensive and our waiter tells us they all taste fairly similar. It's rather bland, and doesn't really improve with the food. Choose another one.\n Dim sum comes in sets of 3 (reflecting the number's association with good luck and the word \"alive\" in Chinese superstition, but often resulting in heavy negotations for me and the TPG.)\n The beautifully presented scallop shui mai (\u00a37.50) is a treasure-like bundle of juicy scallops and prawns topped with gleaming jewels of roe. The winter melon dumplings look like pudgy carrots, but are an enjoyable taste of Thai winter melon, black fungus, straw mushroom and gong choi (\u00a33.80).\n The sticky rice in lotus leaf with chicken and shrimp (\u00a34.80) is good (but not the greatest) but then the char sui bun (3 for \u00a33.50) is fantastic (a must) - and also great value compared to the lesser morsels you might get for around the same price in Chinatown.\n We steer off the dim sum menu to try the Szechuan seafood claypot (\u00a317.00) - a fresh and colourful mix of prawns, (slightly too chewy) squid, peanuts, mushrooms, snowpeas, baby corn and chilli. TPG was more of a fan than I, but possibly because I think this a dim sum haven for me and I'm reluctant to diverge to the larger dishes unless it's for something extraordinary.\n Our warm vanilla rice pudding with banana sorbet and caramelised pineapple (\u00a37.50) is absolutely gorgeous, even if the pineapple was a little hard to negotiate. Handmade chocolates and macaroons are also on display - I tried a selection of 4 chocolates for \u00a33 which were reasonably nice but no match for the pudding.\n One possible hitch to any long, lazy, Sunday afternoon plans you might be hatching is that we were warned our table had to be returned after 2 hours - although no-one policed that once we sat down. We paid around \u00a330 per head for our meal.\n Yauatcha comes with my seal of approval for dim sum with a touch of glamour on the side. I was so impressed, that I've already booked us into Yauatcha's big brother, Hakkasan, next month.\n My only regrets are that we missed the bulging, glistening har gua dumplings and the blue swimmer crab salad with sesame dressing, both of which we had to suffer through others enjoying on the next table. As if we need another excuse to go back."

Yes, you end up paying a lot more for the food than you would at some of the other places in London (and certainly more than you would at most places in Hong Kong, San Francisco, Vancouver). Yes, you pay for some of the attitude and decor. Yes, the chairs are pretty uncomfortable.\nIn the end, it's all about the food and you have to admit that some of the dishes are pretty darn good. The har gau are excellent with clear skins and the right amount of bite. The venison puff (cha siu so) are excellent versions with a nice hint of black pepper and a fantastic flaky crust. I especially like the shrimp and beancurd cheung fun; it's their version of  zha leung but instead of a chinese donut inside, they use a shrimp and beancurd skin roll. Fantastic. Save room for the black sesame dumplings. Some of the best I've ever had anywhere with a truly handmade taste and texture.\nI agree that some of their dishes (especially the non-dim sum mains) are overpriced. If you can avoid those, you can have an excellent dim sum deal for not much more than you would spend in London Chinatown.\nMy biggest pet peeve is that they only make one pot with each order of tea leaves. Some of the teas, especially the oolongs, actually taste better with the second brewing!"

Chances are you won't be disappointed with the flavors of the dishes. The ingredients are obviously of the highest quality and kitchen consistently produces the same high standard every time we've been there. \nAdded to which the restaurant (downstairs) has a very smooth decor; subtle, warm and inviting. The bathrooms are pretty slick too...\nBe sure to try the delicious teas (white tea... mmm-MMM!)."

On a Sunday evening I decided to change that. This is a modern and nicely styled restaurant. Part of the bar is an aquarium, seating is relatively low, it's just a bit different from most other restaurants. That makes it interesting. And the food was really good. I just realized that it even has a Michelin Star."

Sampled baked venison puff, Jasmine tea smoked ribs, Peking duck spring rolls, crab and caviar soup, hand pulled noodle with Shimeji mushrooms. Fresh ingredients, fine craftsmanship, and delicate flavors.\nDessert was spectacular. Had the \"Victoria\", Glazed donut with chocolate mousse and blackberry compote filling, and \"Tendance Cannelle\" a half dome of chocolate mousse enrobed in caramel with a cinnamon cr\u00e8me brulee center. Colorfully tempting selection of macaroons also available. \nSERVICE\nGracious. Lovely waitresses in stylish, white uniforms with decorative straps (of unclear function) strung around the derrieres.\nWILL I BE BACK?\nPricey. Dessert worth a return visit."

    "review": "Wow. Wow. Wow. \nLocated in the Soho district of London you will find Yauatcha, another one of Alan Yau's masterpiece restaurants. One of my mates who resides in London was nice enough to intro me to the restaurant by meeting me there for lunch, it was no doubt THE best dim sum restaurant I have EVER been to in my life, thanks Si. The d\u00e9cor of this restaurant was simply stunning, so much so that I can not even do it justice explaining it here, I'll have to leave it at that, seriously. \nI started with a bowl of Hot & Sour soup with shredded chicken for $6.50 quid. It was truly what I expected, a smooth sweet medley of flavours with a slight hint of tartness (doubt that's a word), one of the finer soups I've tried. They also had shark fin soup which immediately put a foul taste in my mouth althought I didn't even order it, I HATE everything about shark fin soup and that is a completely different discussion. I am glad to know that Alan Yau has removed his 40 pound shark fin soup dish from his world famous restaurant Hakkesan. \nNext from the menu I tried the Pork & Prawn Shumai. It was delectably different from the traditional Pork Shumai that I am used to in the GTA. The texture of this particular dumpling was just perfect with the right amount of meat. It didn't blow me out of the water, but it was damn good. \nNext I had a dish which re-shaped my discerning palette for good. It was a baked venison puff, the best dim sum item that has ever graced my mouth. The texture of this puff was perfectly flaky, the filling was of a richer darker meat, and the sweet taste was so good I thought I was dreaming. The puffs came x 3, but I could have done x 25.  \nAside from Yauatcha there is also Alan Yau's Hakkesan which I briefly mentioned above. Hakkesan is considered by many to be one of the best restaurants in the world, and I am somewhat disappointed that I was not able to hit it up while I was in London. However, I really can't picture the quality of food and d\u00e9cor being all that much better than Yauatcha, at most I can see it being on par which says a lot! I just wanted to mention Hakkesan because if you are in London I would highly recommend both of these restaurants if you are a Dim Sum enthusiast. I will warn you the prices are very high averaging at least $6-7 quid per dish, a big change for me because the dishes here in the GTA run for $3-4 CAD, but more than worth it. \nOnly after I came back from my visit to London did I come to learn that Yauatcha had gained 2 Michelin starts since its inception in 2004. If you don't live in the UK, book your vacation now."

THE WAIT STAFF WILL POCKET YOUR CHANGE!!!!!\nNormally I would have given them a much higher rating but the service CLEARLY was soo bad I have to give them this low rating.\nI had ordered the 2-person taste of Yua-Atcha- which was exceptional. HOWEVER the staff was quite rude about stating their policies(they \"never\" allowed take-away - not true) But the main sore point was the fact when the bill came, I paid in cash over the amount(did not have exact change) - now the gratuity of 12.5% had ALREADY been added to the bill's total amount. I waited and waited until finally asked where my change was - she looked confused and walked away. I then asked the manager for the receipt to check the amount I gave them, again he said NOTHING about returning my change. - NOTE TO ALL - BE VERY WARY - I think that they feel that they \"deserved the extra tips....I definitely will NOT be returning to their establishment!"

Congratulations. A few years ago that was one of the toughest things to do here in London. The night-time 25thCentury Dim Sum bar with it's aquarium-filled cocktail bar and 1 Michelin Star was the talk of the town. The Dim Sum craze began here with Yau's creativity, coolness and excellent design.\nIt helped that they had edible GOLD-painted dumplings too!\nThose bling-bling dumplings have sadly left the menu but plenty of other extravangances exist and the prices can rocket sky high for some small dishes. And if you are trying the world-class teas and masterpiece petit fours upstairs then you could be forgiven for thinking they screwed up and just converted prices one-to-one from Chinese Yuan they are so high.\nBut don't let that fool you. Yauatcha is the cheapest place I've ever had a filling Michelin-starred meal. If you come in a three (3 is the magic Dim Sum number) then you can stuff yourself with many dishes and even have cocktails and quite easily leave without spending more than 30 each. That's pretty magical considering you'll not eat at many places so obviously cool and 25th Century.\nIt's sounding like the perfect date place too, isn't it?\nWell it almost is... but think of all those awkward moments when little dumpling number 3 is lying there and you have to decide who gets it. Take my advice and do your dating mid-afternoon with the tea and cakes upstairs. Yau's Taiwanese tea-expert wife is the lord of this section and this lady gets it right - easily the best Asian teas in town.\nSo why is my once favourite restaurant in the world only getting four stars? Because of the system... the booking, the time allocation and the..\n------- ---------- ---------- --------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- ------- \nYAUATCHA: \" TIME'S UP, please move on now! \"\nME: \" ;__; \""

I'm not experienced enough with dim sum - although I've enjoyed my fair share - to know just how experimental or creative it can be without departing from its essence or origins. But Yauatcha appears to both retain the familiar core of dim sum and push the boundaries of taste and presentation.\n At Yauatcha you could dine out on presentation alone: they take visual beauty very seriously. Each element is artfully combined to play colour against texture against size and shape.\n But most memorably, the clever an unusual combinations of basic ingredients (pork, prawns, scallops, soft-shelled crab, for example) with subtle spices and seasonings, encased in truly world-class pastry, amount to a sparkling dim sum fantasia beyond reasonable expectation.\n The highlight of the afternoon was quite possibly a lovely, moist, spongy, buttery pastry sprinkled with sesame seeds with a venison (yes, venison) stuffing that just oozed with sinful suggestiveness.\n Jade dumplings, so-called because of their green hue, stuffed with wild mushrooms were another inspired marvel.\n The tea menu is equally staggering in its breadth - we practically got high on so many delicate, aromatic teas.\n And all of this happens under the watchful eye of slightly dopey goldfish and miniature carp in a long fishtank.\n Service is somewhat erratic and indifferent, but when the dim sum starts flowing, coming at you in waves of colour, you are past caring.\n This is a damn fine restaurant."

I've had a lot of Chinese food in some of the most heavily populated immigrant communities and across several continents.  This is not even the best Chinese food I've had in UK.  The food isn't bad but worthy of Michelin star.  Pretty funny is you ask me.  This place is gorgeous and the layout is absolutely gorgeous as far as restaurants go, especially for Chinese.  The macaroon display at the front is beautiful but I didn't especially like them, a bit too sweet for my liking.  The other reaon why I think I didn't enjoy the meal as much was the price tag for dim sum.  It was on the corporate card so I shouldn't care but it's the principle damnit.  \nFood was good with a bunch of hit and misses among the bunch.  The har gow was nice, well made, good texture to the wrapper.  Har gow was ok.  Some of the other shrimp dumplings we had were also very nice.  I also enjoyed the duck rolls.  There were definitely some low points with the noodle and meat dishes.  Did any of the people who reviewed the restaurant actually review based on food or the fact that this place is Michelin rated or that the space is stunning?  Come on people let's do better.

So it only made sense that her birthday dinner should involve cakes that look so pretty it would be a crying shame to defile them by eating them (we didn't take much convincing though, no arm-twisting required) and guzzling our collective bodyweight in har gau and venison puffs. Don't do what I did and do a last minute booking (sister decided to change plans on my a day before) or you'll be put upstairs, which is very nice but not quite as pleasing on the beautifully designed basement floor. It's always packed to the rafters from Thursday onwards too, which is great when you want to have raucuous conversation with someone you've not seen in ages, without offending anyone. The service is ultra efficient and attentive. They even top up your tea for you.\n My view is this: Yauatcha is a treat for the special people in your life. So far the only people who have been taken under my steam are my mum, my sister and an ex with whom I am still friends. So if I take you to a place with a blue glass wall, you've got to be doing something right!

Alan Yau won Britain's first Michelin star for his Chinese cooking at London's Hakkasan  and has opened Yauatcha a couple of years ago.\nPlaced in middle of Soho my first trip there was in a rickshaw straight from a musical. We did not have a reservation and we also risked to miss the last order at 11pm at Saturday. After several left and rights in a labyrinth of narrow streets we arrives safe and sound. \nFriendly greeted we entered the ground floor of a modern decorated restaurant having our eyes drawn to gold fishes swimming in the display windows. The waiters all are dressed in a uniform designed by Tim Yip, who won an Oscar for art direction in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. During peak hours this restaurant is packed, lucky for us, we did not have to wait for a table and were seated in the chic teahouse and patisserie. \nI prefer it to the restaurant in the basement as I have to my front colourful patisseries displayed and to my back direct view into the kitchen, where Chinese chefs prepare the dim sums. Ordering several starters to share and some jasmine tea I finally get to try my prawn and date dumplings, which literally melt in my mouth. These Chinese dumplings were among the best I have ever tasted.

I was excited that they had chicken feet in chlli black bean sauce here. The flavor was more prominent then normal chicken feet dim sum dishes. The best thing I had here was the prawn and beancurd cheung fun. It had such great texture and taste. The outside was soft dumpling texture, but the next inner layer was the asian churro texture (think chalupa) and filled with deliciousness. For dessert I had the warm vanilla rice pudding with banana sorbet and caramelized pineapple. It was disappointing.

And then, I went for dinner one evening.. and ended up going back so often(4x within 2 weeks) I got heartily sick of the food..! ;)\n But that's not a criticism of the dishes, because.. had I not loved the food, I would not have gone back time and again, bringing different groups of friends there.\n These days, I still visit.. but less often. I usually bring friends from out-of-town there for dim sum with a twist... if they fancy having Chinese.\n I like the fact that chefs at Yauatcha have come up with an inventive dim sum menu (and unlike other Chinese restaurants, continue serving dim sum past 5pm).\n Although, to be fair.. these days, it's not so uncommon to find innovative dim sum dishes at other Chinese restaurants, still.. I go back to Yauatcha specially for some of my favourite steamed baskets: enoki mushroom & prawn dumplings, shitake & duck roll, shanghai spicy dumplings just to name a few. The mango spring roll is sweetly delicious - just be careful not to burn your tongue in your haste to get in a yummy bite.\n I'd recommend the Singapore Fried Noodles (altho there's no such dish in Singapore!) for back up, just in case you're not full by the end of the meal.\n Be prepared to pay at least 20% more for dim sum at Yautatcha. In fact, some of their prices are exorbitant but, if you fancy a treat, then by all means, tuck in! I wouldn't recommend ordering ordinary dim sum dishes at Yauatcha (e.g. Har Gau, Siew Mai aka prawn & pork dumpling, Char Siew Pau etc)... because these, you can get at any other Chinese restaurant, and at cheaper prices too. Always go for something special and different at Yauatcha, because.. after all, you're paying for it!\n I adore their tea cocktails (non-alcoholic).. and always order a Plum Cut Larrisa when I'm there. The Mama-Zhao is nice too, if you fancy a thicker smoothie sort of drink. But everyone who's ever tried my Plum Cut Larrisa insist they want to order that on their next round.

Getting in was half the fun, since on the outside, all one saw were blue glass walls.  The space inside (the upstairs tea shop) was hip & fun and ready for the lunch crowd.  After settling in and given the complimentary Chinese pickles, i poured over the long list of items on the menu.  At Yauatcha, I really like their particular format for dim sum.  No one is pushing carts and hawking dishes, so you're not sitting there just waiting for stuff to come by.  You can order whatever you want from the menu.  Spend more time with your company, and again, just enjoy the surroundings.\nFor the 2 of us, we had a pot of tea, 7 dim sum items, and a rice dish.  The roasted Anxi Tie Guan Yin was very subtle, but had a mild smoky taste.  Some of the standout dishes included the Wild Mushroom Dumpling.  Oyster, shimeiji, and shitake in a chive-flavored dumpling skin, dotted on top with euryale seeds.  Perfect starter.  The Prawn Cheung Fun had the added crunch of brunoise of zucchini (or I suppose I should call it courgette as I was in London).  ;-).  The Pan-fried Turnip Cake had a whole mess of herbs and dried shrimp, a far cry from the bland affair at a lot of dim sum places.  The Sesame Prawn Toast was a throwback to my childhood.  Except here, there was a whole prawn, aside from the prawn paste.  The last dish was the Egg White & Salted Fish Fried Rice.  Typically, this dish could get bogged down with being too greasy, and too salty ingredients.  Here, it is very mild and perfectly seasoned.  A perfect finale to a perfect lunch.\nWhy 4 stars?  This is dim sum kicked up a few notches.  The dishes have been enhanced to make them more special.  It is in a modern, cool room  that provided a lot of the usual convivial vibe at dim sum houses.  Perhaps purists might scoff at the Westernization of it all, but i simply loved it."

We said we just wanted cakes and were told we had 40 minutes, which would have been fine if we hadn't been ignored by all the staff having an impromptu staff meeting for 20 minutes.  We sauntered over to the dessert area and ordered our cakes and the lady placed them on a nice dish each and said someone would bring them over.  We should have taken them ourselves as we waited over 5 minutes and we severely pushed for time.\nFor quality of food this places rates highly but it has a long way to go to even be close to an enjoyable experience."

    "review": "Even though this place is known for its dim sum, it definitely brings a few twists to the entire experience. The atmosphere is so much more different to those you'd find not too far away in Chinatown, a combination between dark wooden panels, bright blue colours and a very colourful fishtank (I'm assuming filled with tropical fish).\n The dim sum is definitely of a much higher standard with some different twists including a number of dumplings with game meats in them. Of course, you will end up spending a little bit more on dim sum compared to other places, but it's great for something out of the ordinary.\n Their tea selection is also significantly different for those that want something other than the standard Chinese selection."

They always serve a small selection of dim sum (including venison steamed buns which they are famous for), along with demi versions of their cakes, macaroons and truly wonderful scones. Quite often I taken friends there on a Saturday at about 3 for a late lunch. I usually order a couple of other plates of dimsum and then share the tea. Otherwise, if you haven't tried it, the cactus lime truffles are heavenly."

The service is really efficient and pleasant - never pushy, always attentive and precise.\n A huge range of green, blue, and smoked teas are available and the staff are always happy to recommend something that goes well with the food you've ordered. The food is classic Chinese fusion but steers clear of the outlandish or merely sensational. Quality and flavour is the keynote.\n To finish, select gold leaf topped violet and rose flavoured cakes or light chocoloate mousses topped with lime flower and candied cinammon. Just looking at the cakes makes you think you've gone to some kind of food heaven.\n Innovative cocktails and soft drinks complete the 'event' that each meal here inevitably becomes. It's a treat."

Even if i can't pronounce the name.\n I let my friends order whatever the felt was right and they did a damn good job. Highlights were Salt and Pepper squid, Deep fried Quail (it was like posh KFC - fatty and sweet and brilliant) and the sea bass and crab dumplings were pretty amazing too.\n This is the best Chinese food I've eaten in London. There's a great atmosphere. It's buzzy enough to be fun, but dark and quiet enough to be romantic if you wanted to come here with your other half (and it would impress on a date as well - take note people).\n Cocktails are amazing. Huge. With flowers in and stuff. But you don't get drunk. You drink them because they're yummy. They do a ginger mojito thing which is great.\n I love it here. I really love it here. It's not cheap - drinks and dinner will set you back about fifty quid a head (although I reckon if you were a couple it would be much less as you wouldn't order so many dishes between you - maybe about \u00a330?), but it doesn't matter once you're here. It's all worth every penny.\n Can someone please take me back there?"

My favourites include the pork and prawn shui mai and the simple chive dumplings.

The variety of tea leaves available is huge including hand rolled ones as well!\nOne downside of this restaurant is the service.

    "review": "Hot on the heels, okay well two weeks after, of Yauatcha being sold by creator Alan Yau to a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority I decided to finally check out the dim sum on offer by the restaurant. The premium price tag on the dim sum has previously prevented us from treating this place as an every day dim sum dining experience but we thought we better get in to check it out before there was any change to the formula that has so far proven to be a major success for Alan Yau.\n Blue is the overriding colour when you first behold the sight that is Yauatcha. Upon entering the restaurant you will see before you an elegant brightly lit modern and cleanly designed room. I'm not sure if bookings are still essential but today at just after noon we were able to dine as walk-ins. We were actually taken downstairs today where there is still a theme of blue from the frosted glass that covers the kitchen and the chefs to the long aquarium running across the front of the bar filled with bright colourful goldfish but suddenly we were plunged into darkness - a Ping Pong-ish style of decor.\n The service is as you would expect in a restaurant of this calibre - efficient, friendly and accommodating. Upon first sitting you are presented with the drinks menu which is an almost overwhelming list of teas and wines. You won't find bottomless pots of simple tea here - not like the pots of tea you get at regular dim sum places at any rate. There's a large variety of blue tea, black tea, green tea and flower tea on also. Not to mention they also have a wide selection of iced teas amongst which I can recommend the Lime and Passion Ice Tea which is my dining partner had and the Melon Ice Tea - both of where were extremely refreshing.\n The dim sum menu features some of the regulars such as Har Gau, Shumai, Cheung Fun, and Steam Pork Bun. There were also a number of items I'd never seen before on a dim sum menu a couple of which we tried out including Ostrich Dumplings (quite delicious and self-saucing) and Baked Venison Puff (very similar to Barbecue Pork Puff but obviously with venison.) As the prices were quite high we couldn't be too adventurous but it would have been interesting to try other dishes such as Chilean Sea Bass Mooli Roll, Native Lobster in Black Bean Sauce, Wagyu Beef Cheung Fun, and Box Dumpling. We couldn't resist the Jasmine Tea Smoked Organic Ribs, which we also sampled when we went to sister restaurant Hakkasan. They weren't too bad but not nearly as tasty or fall off the bone as the ones from Hakkasan.\n The price tag for our one meal today would have bought us two meals at any other restaurant but it was worth it to check out the hype that is Yauatcha."

The drinks menu also offers a wide choice but the main attraction, for me at least, are the beautiful desserts that they have. Glorious creations beautifully presented and, though at \u00a34.50 each, they are a bit pricey one bite will assure you that it's worth it You can also by desserts to take out which is perfect for any special occasion or indulgent snacking.\nAs stated, prices aren't cheap but not overly extortionate either.

We entered the restaurant for our 7:00 reservation and had a short wait in the front shop area which is exquisitely designed and sells a selection of macaroons and chocolates in house. They are extremely tempting and a few in our party bought a selection to take home.\n We were lead downstairs to the restaurant which is a square brick room with a partially hidden kitchen, sparkly lights on the ceiling (sounds tacky  it isn't) and cut outs in the brick with faux candles. I can imagine what the room must have looked like at one time, and am very impressed with what they've done.\n The service was absolutely stunning, and I can hand on heart say it was probably the best service I have ever had especially considering we were a group. At one point the manager came to me (I was the organizer) and asked me how my food was. He then very specifically asked how the service was and to please tell him if there was anything. It was extremely sincere and very surprising. A colleague later told me that the reviews about their service on the website were very poor so this appears to be something they are working hard on and have completely turned around. This is impressive, and if you were ever put off from a visit because of this I recommend you visit. For the food I just asked them to bring us a selection to the table. It was brought in even intervals without any long waits, and the empty dishes were quickly whisked away. If we needed another glass or bottle of wine it was almost immediate. I couldn't believe it. We were all very impressed.\n The food was also very good. Highlights for me were the Beancurd Cheung Fun which I believe was beancurd and pork in a long roll, the scallop shumai with the most exquisitely cooked scallops, and the Ribeye Beef in Black Bean sauce. I didn't try it but was told that the Orchid Pao Chung (Orchid Tea) was amazing. They chose a wide range of dishes for us, and served a perfect amount of food. We didn't drink a lot (3 bottles of wine for 9 people) but it turned out to around \u00a346 per person including tip which is fabulous.\n I can't wait to go back, and hope it can live up to my previous experience!\n \nroastedmontreal.blogspot\u2026"

She apologised for the unpleasant service experienced by us and even took off 2 of our desserts order from the final bill.\nWe appreciated her help / offer but sadly, I don't think I will be back in a hurry. Don't mind splashing out for good quality food on special occasions but service level was just atrocious! We overheard the same service problem on an adjacent table before we left.

The dimsum tastes like it is made to order, unlike the mass produced stuff that has been sitting in bamboo steamers all morning. There are also many items on the menu that are certainly not-dimsum or Asian at all: honey glazed lamb ribs, venison puff pastry, etc., that are an interesting take on fusion cuisine.\n People often talk about the decor here: it is an interesting modern and trendy looking space but very un-Chinese. In fact, other than the kitchen staff, almost everyone else you will encounter (at the door or serving your food) will be Caucasian PYTs of both genders. The experience felt more LA than London.\n So save up some money and give the place a try, and you'll walk away with a dimsum experience you will still be talking about a year later."

I also double checked on Yelp and noticed most of the bad reviews were non-Asian or complaints about the restaurant, service, or tip. Aka, good food? Im down! \nThe entrance and ground floor is tight but we managed to be lead upstairs to our table. I am glad they gave us a bigger table for our winter jackets, shopping bags, and room for the food we ordered. \nWe asked what were some of the best sellers and ordered two dishes to share. Plus an appetizer of xiao long bao. \nThe xiao long bao was meh, skip it. \nWe also ordered the crispy aromatic duck and lobster. The duck was extremely good. The lobster as quite good as well, but not a good as impressive as the duck. The duck I highly recommend getting when visiting here. Next time I will get the traditional roast duck as it has been deemed by the Financial Times as \"the best roast duck in the world\" lol. That probably means at least in the UK it is the best. \nThe waiter does speak Chinese and English so no worries if you cant speak Chinese. \nThis place is pretty traditional from the food to experience. Dirty, small, dingy restaurant. Waiter is pushy and cranky (what Chinese adult/parent isnt lol). Plating is traditional (plopped on a plate lol). Table side service for the duck. The only thing I didnt do is get a hot bowl of water to clean my utensils lol. \nYou do have to pay for rice and water. Oh, and I think I spotted 20% automatic tip. \n*For my fellow Chinese : Every Chinese person is showing face so wear nice clothes- service is better then - hint hint. \nThis place offers great authentic Chinese food. Get off the high horse and get passed the ambiance/cleanliness, plating, service, cost, etc. and enjoy the good food they have to offer. Its good.

I personally feel like this place is more authentic than the other places on Chinatown which may account for why it lacks popularity.\nThe person who served us was relatively polite and nice but one of the ladies working was pretty rude to us. \nWe ordered beef noodle soup, fried rice, Chinese spinach, and seafood soup. The fried rice was good as was the spinach. The noodle soups were just ok and were not anything special.\nOverall, this was a subpar place and I probably wouldn't go to it again. It wasn't awful but it wasn't great."

    "review": "I just had dinner with the family here at the Four Seasons for Mother's Day. So first of all, I want to apologize to my mom for taking her here. Our dishes were extremely greasy and salty. I understand that a little use of oil prevents stickiness in the pan but when the vegetable dish is greasier than the meat dish then there's a problem. The couple things that were passable was the steam rice and BBQ pork. The chow fun was drenched with a very salty gravy. I think my doctor would recommend me to stop dining here. \nAlso the men's toilet is the smallest one I've been to. How small is it? Imagine sharing an airplane bathroom with another person. I swear while I was peeing I was rubbing shoulders with the man in the next stall and rubbing cheeks with another man washing his hands. Intimacy is good sometimes but not in the toilet. \nAfter the meal there is complimentary orange slices and mint for your stinky breath. They also add a 12% service charge to your bill."

We are sat and given water but had to ask for tea at $1.50/pp. When it came time to place our order I asked again in Chinese for 1/4 duck, chicken satay appetizer and the braised beef wonton noodles.\nThe chicken came out first and then the noodles without the beef. I looked confused and said I ordered the beef one. One of the waitresses offered to switch it but I said it was fine. What bothered me was that waiter was adamant that I was wrong. He protested in Chinese \"I'm not wrong! She didn't order that!!!\" Soooooo when I speak in Chinese you pretend you don't know any but when something is wrong you complain in Chinese?? What great customer service...\nThe wonton noodles were soggy and an off putting grey color. It's as if the noodles were pre cooked and just left out - the noodles were still sticking together in clumps in the hot broth. \nThe duck was extremely dry and I was insulted that they would serve it. We were basically given shredded scraps (see pic). Had I not slathered the pancake with hoisin sauce, it would've been inedible. \nThe chicken satay was decent from the one bite I tried but still fairly dry.\nThis establishment provides better service to non-Chinese clientele from what I saw when I was there. \nAlso, I think they sensed I was annoyed and they automatically charged  20% tip to our check under \"Discretionary\" even though we were just a party of 2. What crappy business practices!!!!!"

We opted for the three meat plate each time and it was plenty of food to share. Their duck was juicy and not too fatty. I don't think it was a life changing dish but it was solid. What we really enjoyed, surprisingly, was their soy chicken. It was moist and had just a hint of flavor from the soy sauce. Their crispy pork was also solid and a nice textural difference to have. \nAs for their other options, we were not impressed. We also tried their Peking style duck which was too dry and was definitely not worth the price. It honestly tasted like it was sitting out for too long. Their calamari wasn't special and was overcooked. I don't even really remember the other dishes we tried because they weren't that good."

The duck was OK, the pork was delicious and the chicken came with no skin, no bone and the spring onion came ontop of the duck! Why?? Plus the overall meat portion was small. \nThe starters were appalling and clearly aimed at an unassuming audience who wouldn't know better. The ribs were bone dry and bland, the dumpling skin was thick and fried, but not in the way you'd want. The spring rolls were supposed to be 2 large pork ones but ended up being 4 small ones with non-existant chicken. \nOverall, I'd cone back for their expensive rice dishes if I had no other choice, but the starters were awful.

The three of us ordered the duck pancakes with a half duck and salt&pepper tofu (beancurd). The duck pancakes were delectable!

We were given the duck sauce (looks like BBQ sauce) along with a trio of spices to fully customize our heavenly duck experience. \nThe salt&pepper tofu was alright, but it was nothing special so I wouldn't order it again. \nCONS - It's a bit spendy for the amount of duck you get but Four Seasons know they are hot shit compared to other roast duck places around Chinatown so they are \"entitled\" to price their duck that way ;) So the problem lies solely with me and that I should get a higher paying job to eat more duck pancakes, dammit!"

We ordered a whole roast duck (\u00a324), sliced beef (which was savory and slightly sweet, but so juicy and delicious), choi sum vegetables stir fried with garlic, tofu with prawn stuffing, and a herbal pork soup with black and white pepper which was a milky white color because of the carnation milk they added (we took a chance with the soup because it was so cold and we were so glad we did, it was so yummy and helped clear out my sinuses).  The total bill was around \u00a3100 but the food was amazing,  definitely one of the best I've ever had from both the U.K., and the USA.  The restaurant was fairly old and small even though it has two floors. We sat in the first floor and there were 6 tables. The staff was incredibly attentive. When we arrived, they took a few minutes to set up a table for us (3 adults and a toddler) and the toddler seat was set up before we even asked for one.  Once, we had dropped a chopstick, and the owner (manager?) immediately  grabbed us a new pair of chopsticks. When all our dishes arrived, our table was quite crowded and they quickly lifted up the extension of the table and gave us more space.  The staff spoke both Cantonese and Mandarin and I felt completely at ease conversing with them in Cantonese as they were extremely friendly and customer oriented. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for amazing Cantonese food. They also own \"Little Four Seasons\" which was more on the main side of Gerard Street but I have not yet tried it."

We ordered 2 types of Chinese soups that were typical standard for Europe: barely passable but that's so not the point of being here.  \nThe staff were somewhat curt but very efficient.  They managed to quickly get us a seat on the ground floor (important as a friend was hobbling with a walking stick) when we walked in on a Sunday afternoon.

Delicious yummy roast duck with tender meat, crispy skin well marinated with herbs, a highly recommended stop in central London near Leicester Square and West End. Casual eatery, brusque service, real attraction is the world class roast duck!"

This is simply good Chinese food cooked for those in need of a Chinese fix, which is greatly appreciated if you've lived in Europe too long. The roast duck is absolutely divine; the skin is crispy and the fat melts in your mouth. The hot plate beef - I suggest the black pepper sauce - is also recommended. Finally, you can't go wrong with some Yangzhou fried rice."

    "review": "Was pretty disappointed with our experience here. Firstly, I know a lot of Chinatown restaurants aren't pretty at the best of times, but the basement here really is pretty basic. \nFood wise, the actual food wasn't bad, although I realise now that we stupidly ordered crispy duck when we should have gone for their famous roast duck...oh well. The real problem was that should have come first but instead they brought out our brisket stew, with no rice, so it went cold while we waited. Then the pork we ordered actually arrived cold, and had to be sent back. Duck arrives at this point. We ordered more rice but that never turned up (nor on the bill, which was something). Overall, very poor service and I think that's the first time I've ever had to send something back to the kitchen to be heated. I would hesitate to come again, even though I'd like to try the proper duck!"

You'll be in and out pretty quick and it's what they're famous for their duck.  Though their aubergine with minced pork hotpot and black bean beef ho fun was pretty good as well.\nIn terms of service, they operate like a well oiled machine. Notice the handsfree earpieces.  How many restaurants in London have you seen those in?  if everything goes well.  They'll seat, serve and get you out asap."

My friend and I were looking to grab a simple dinner in Chinatown, and when I looked up restaurant reviews, they were all around 3.5 stars out of 5 and I wondered how they could have all been so poor. There is nothing that is 4 stars or above. I've been here a few times to get barbecued meat or roast duck for takeaway, which somehow always managed to set me back \u00a310-15, but it's well regarded for having the best roast duck in London and the char siu and crispy pork belly was always solid too. It's expensive, but on the bright side it's the same price to eat in, so that is probably the best option at this restaurant. The other items on the menu were outrageously expensive - the highlight was that plates of seasonal vegetables will send you back \u00a39, when clearly the cost at the supermarket next door would be something like \u00a32. We got stir fried prawns with seasonal vegetables (which turned out to be broccoli, not even anything special) for \u00a310, but at least there were prawns. We also got the crispy duck with pancakes, which was nice because we could order \u00bc duck, which you can't with the Peking duck, but the crispy duck was a dry, shredded, indistinguishable version of the normal glazed and juicy roast duck glory. I wouldn't recommend it. The table next to us got the Peking duck and I had serious food envy. Our last dish was the young chow fried rice. The disappointing part about this was that it was served lukewarm. The whole meal costs us nearly \u00a340 in total, which is terrible value and you should definitely be able to do much better in Chinatown. I might come here for the barbecued meat or roast duck takeaway, but it's not worth your while to eat in."

So we went back a week later. \nAnd.... \nI don't think a restaurant could drop the ball any further... And they weren't even as busy as usual.... Maybe that's a sign of the times. \nAfter 40 minutes we received our duck pancakes,  the duck was nice but seemed to be dry from sitting out too long,  then..... Nothing.... 20 mins later we received cold soft shell crab.... Ten minutes later Kung Po... Very tasty.... But cold.... No rice.... 10 mins later... Rice.... What's the point \nNo apology just an interest to take money and run.

    "review": "This is my other half's favourite haunt for roast duck. It's not hard to see why as their Bayswater branch is famous for it, they have won countless awards (and glued these to their window and walls, including newspaper clippings for you to read while you wait!)\nA quick summary before we begin:- If you want tasty roast duck, come here. If you want excellent service to go with it, please look elsewhere because you will not find it here.\nTo elaborate, the roast duck is the juiciest duck you will ever taste. Sometimes it may be overly fatty but the fat is what makes it taste so good. The soya sauce that comes with it is really sweet and I can only imagine the amount of sugar that has gone into it. However, I cannot complain as I have a sweet tooth and generous helpings of this sauce with the roast duck makes me a happy bunny.\nI usually get the roast duck for takeaway to eat at home, unfortunately the price has gone up recently, it's around \u00a318.50 for a whole roast duck. If you are ordering takeaway please ignore the queue outside and just go straight to the till to order. \nSometimes if you come really late in the night (I actually mean 9pm) they would have sold out of roast ducks. Have no fear, they opened another branch about 3 min walk away down the end of Gerrard Street, at Wardour Street. They usually have a few roast duck hanging up even though this branch has run out.\nOnto the issue of service. Inevitably you will see a queue start forming here as early as 6pm. The restaurant is tiny and there are just too many people trying to eat here all the time that you end up freezing outside while you wait. If you do manage to get a table, you will get one of these two:- get ignored by the waiter for refills of drinks, or get hurried by the waiter to pay up and leave so they can sit someone else down. If you are lucky you will get both treatments!\nTip: maybe stick with takeaways and cook your own rice at home!"

I do happen to be a fan of duck, so when he recommended we go to the Four Seasons in Chinatown, I was all for it!\nThe place is fairly small and looks like most Chinese places I've been to.  There were seven in our group so we were sat at one of the larger tables in the back that have rotating glass in the center (very good for family style sharing).  Since my friend had been here before, we let him do most of the ordering.\nWe started with hot and sour soup (one of my personal favorites) which was much spicier than what I've had here in the States.  I'm a huge fan of spicy food so that was no problem for me!  We then moved into our main courses of whole roasted duck and BBQ duck, both of which were absolutely delicious.  The whole duck came with thin tortilla-like wraps that we used with veggies and sauces to make our own duck wraps.  I'm not such a fan of the BBQ duck as it's a little fatty for my liking.\nWe also had a shrimp dish which was pretty yummy.  For whatever reason, someone thought it would be a good idea to order Lychee wine.....yeeeaaaahhhh....not the best.  It was way too sweet, strong, and just overall not good.  Wouldn't recommend it.\nFor dessert we had just plain old Lychee which WAS delicious.  Those sweet little balls made my mouth very happy (that's what she said).  When you're done with your entire meal, they bring you oranges (kind of like an after dinner mint).\nThe service wasn't too bad.

No matter, once I got into the restaurant the waiters were so friendly and instinctively poured me a glass of wine that I suddenly began to feel more relaxed. \nThere was no pressure to hurry in this place which I think is one of the most important things. We were able to order our Duck and starters and take our time over them. The Duck was as good as I have ever had, really meaty, we ordered a half and we got a big half! \nAfter a leisurely start we were obliged to order mains, even though we were actually all full. Ordered was: Mixed Seafood and Noodle Soup, I thought this tasted like pond water but everyone else seemed to like it, weird! Salt and Pepper Squid, this was amazing. Best I've had in a Chinese restaurant. The batter was really light and crispy with just the right amount of chili's, there was way to much for one person but I didn't let it stop me. There was also Sweet & Sour Pork and King Prawns with seasonable vegetables. I presume these were also both delicious as I didn't get a look in. \nFor the four of us with 3 bottles of wine, duck, starters and mains it came to just over \u00c2\u00a3100."

Hands down.\nduck in London is better than most other places because they are naturally leaner.  the duck was roasted well: crispy skin, scrumptious taste/barbecue, lean indeed.  the renowned sauce which is a well protected secret is the best roast duck sauce i've ever had.  it's not too salty and has a tad of sweetness to it.  the roast duck dipped in the sauce is heaven in my mouth.  the sauce over rice is also great.\nthe only downfall is that after a while, the duck gets really oily and the bottom of the box/plate is drenched in oil.\nthe barbecue pork is also extremely delicious, also one of the best i've had.  great marinade/barbecue taste.\nthe roast pork was slightly salty (but then again all Chinese roast pork is).  the skin had a great crunch to it.\ni was vacationing in London for a few days but i had to come here twice!\ni ordered the food to go both times.  the cashier/waiter was friendly and helpful the first time.  but the cashier/waitress was gruff and very rushed the second time.  but i still give this restaurant 5 stars for the best roast duck in the world."

It came with a larger than normal portion of gratuitous chinese cabbage (i.e. more than 1 leaf).  As others have said, the soy gravy that comes with it is quite sweet, but I like it that way.\nThey were nice people there, with 3 types of chillies and gave me soured plum sauce immediately when I requested it.\nThe bad thing was they dumped some oranges on my table before I finished the plate and then dumped the check on the table whiles I was finishing the orange.  They took the bill away the second I reached for the mint and my hand left the bill container thingy.  Although I get that it is busy, I didn't appreciate being literally swept out of the restaurant.  I must say, it was probably them more than me who kept the meal to the 25 minutes limit.\nFood:  Solid 4.5 stars.  Service: (minus 1 star) = 3.5 stars."

    "review": "Over many visits to this Chinatown staple I have sampled many of their excellent dishes and I can honestly say that I have never once been disappointed. Four Seasons is known for their barbecued meats and for good reason. Their Peking Duck is succulent and tasty. I also have their Crispy Aromatic duck which is very flavourful and crispy- the most perfect incarnation of this dish that I have ever had. In terms of other starters I have had the Peking Dumplings (strong flavour and very 'juicy') and Vegetarian Spring Rolls (Crispy with a high amount of vegetables inside). In terms of Main Course I have a group of dishes which are some of my favourites in the world. The Pork chop in honey and pepper sauce (from the Chef's Specials) is delicious, the pork chops are always flavoursome with a crispy exterior, the sauce is absolutely delicious and sweet with an almost caramel texture this combined with chopped up onions makes an absolutely stunning dish. The Black Bean dishes are also very good. The Beans themselves are as tasteful as ever and are slightly soft as (in my opinion they should be) and with a kick of chili it is very good. I would recommend the Beef in Black Bean sauce rather than the pork as the Pork is sometimes a tad too fatty for me. The Singapore Noodles are also very good with another hit of Chili to add to the flavour. As someone who is a huge fan of Mushrooms the Chicken with Chinese and Straw mushrooms is delicious and always comes with a hearty helping of various Mushrooms. The straw mushrooms are especially delicious!! \nEven though I have visited many times and have eaten many dishes there, there are still loads of dishes I want to try, the Fish dishes will be next I think. Anyway it has a great range of dishes at very competitive prices; we spent about \u00a325 a head and had more food than we could eat. The only negative for some people may be the service. It is not always particularly efficient and/or 'chatty' but thats exactly what gives this place it's authentic charm.\nOverall:\nPrice: Very good for the volume of food (Around \u00a315-25 a head)\nFavourite Item: Pork Chop in Honey and Pepper Sauce.\nWorst Aspect: I honestly cannot name one.\nWould recommend? Definitely I plan to go back as soon as possible."

I'm not too sure it's the best in the world but it's the best I've had in London and on par with the roast duck I had at the considerably more upscale Peninsula Hotel in Beijing.\n One piece of advice based on my experience at Four Seasons: forego the rest of the menu and just order the duck. Everything I've tried on the menu is pretty good but nowhere near as good as the duck. Besides there are plenty of other decent Chinese restaurant around Chinatown."

To emphasise the point, the word 'Queensway' is actually written in brackets on the restaurant sign. \nFour Seasons is famous for its roast duck. For my quick tutorial on the different types of duck in a CHinese restaurant, please refer to my review of the original Four Seasons in Queensway. I think the duck here is good but the accompanying soya sauce is a little sweet for my taste. They also offer it on or off the bone - it costs more to have it de-boned.\nI find it fascinating to stand and watch the chef using his big cleaver with the precision of a surgeon to de-bone the duck.\nSo why one star less than the Queensway restaurant? The service here seems to have taken on the Chinatown shouting rudeness. At Queesnway, they never shout, even when it's stupidly busy."

Most people go for the roast duck but I find their soy sauce chicken is quite delicious as well. For a little bit more than a fiver, you can get a decent portion of bbq, a little bit of veg, and a pile of rice.\nHowever I made the mistake of coming here for dinner and trying some things off their \"specials\" menu. In chinese, they all sounded very appetising and more interesting than western style chinese food. In the end however what we got did not live up to what I was expecting; certainly nowhere close to what I've had in Vancouver, Hong Kong, San Francisco, even Royal China here in London. The portion sizes were extremely small, mediocre in skill, and poor value.\nI say stick to the rice plate and roast meat and you'll do fine."

Granted, coming from South East Asia my standards are probably higher than most, I can still count several other places that have daily dim sum that are better. For example, har gau is meant to look like a shiny jewel that you can just about see the prawn through. The har gau here was far too thick so it felt like the insides were not enough.

While the food is on point (try the new pork soup steamed dumplings - I can't spell it but you'll see it on the menu), the ambience is rather lost when you have to sit outside because they still have those awful eight people tables in the main dining area.\nBut at least we managed to avoid those again. Instead we ended up on a rather small two person table outside - which was made better once the nearby heat lamp was turned off as suddenly it felt like we weren't being cooked.\nFood was fine but the manager who took the order slip from us didn't notice we had ordered two portions of the pork buns. So once our waiter realised it was rectified but came a while after everything else."

    "review": "One of the worst meals ever.  Located near Royal Festival Hall, this is a very happening spot.  Dim sum and swanky modern decor, the wait was long and the food looked good.  We had high expectations and the anticipation was exciting.  Our server was not very friendly and seemed shocked we did not want anything but tap water.  The ordering process is like a sushi bar where you mark your own list of dim sum.  We picked items and tried to flag our server down.  She comes back, took our order sheet, then a while later says they are out of a ton of stuff, crossing out several of our order list and other items....okay thanks.  We decided to stick with the remaining first and ended up adding one item (shrimp toast).  \nThe food took forever to come out and when it did, it looked pretty good but tasted terrible.  Sometimes the temperature was off (our first dish was the honey chicken on rice and it was partially hot and partially cold).  As my mom put it, the food got worse with each dish.  The duck spring rolls were mushy and bland, the beef lettuce wraps (a special) were just boring plain shredded beef with no flavor, and it was just so disappointing.\nUnfortunately, it was pricey too, and we left spending way more than we should have for a meal that was barely edible.  Don't be fooled by the crowds and go somewhere else!"

    "review": "Ping Pong has always looked so stylish from the outside so I was excited to go in and try the food.\nOrdering can be a bit tricky, as you are called to fill out a form with all the items on the menu. We were four people and 3 of us went for the set menu so when the items started arriving it took a while for us to figure out which one belonged to what menu and explain to the waitress she would have to tell us what was what.\nThe food itself was very satisfying, I particularly enjoyed the fried selection  but the dumplings and vegetables were quite nice too. The black tea was a bit bitter but full of flavour so I enjoyed that without needing to add any sugar.\nI felt quite full after that meal but the guys in the group (the other two set menus) did mention they could still eat more so you may want to keep that in mind and order a couple more dishes. I'd say ordering lots of things and sharing would be the best option.\nIn general it was a lovely place for a midweek lunch with my team and I hope we go back again."

Or so it tastes better because I have limited time and usually rocking a pram to sleep or running after my toddler with a delicious pork rib in hand. Either way, i'm a huge fan!\nThe chicken and crunchy peanut salad is really good. Avcocado, crisp lettuce, chicken, and a great peanut sauce thats still light. Well done. \nThe spicy prawn bao is a build it your own asian style taco thing that was super tasty as well. I'm not keen on build it your own stuff but this wasn't messy or anything so that is a plus. \nThe Mocktails were also really nice. I had the jasmine and mint, the jasmine had gone a bit bitter as it was brewed a while but i'm not sure if i'm just a tea snob or not. I take that back, i'm a total tea snob and i know what over brewed tea tastes like. That being said, it was still nice. \nThe staff were really nice too.

Lots of the food is yummy and while it's a bit expensive, we can still usually get out for around \u00a330 for 2 (no alcohol). \nUnfortunately I'm not a big fan of this branch. It's big and loud and we're almost always put at a table for 8, all scrunched around with strangers and no room. I get that it's how it is there but it's not really my thing.\nWe went last week with another couple, and were at a nice table for 4. The service is usually quite good but on this occasion, our waiter just could not be bothered. Since we wanted separate bills, each couple did their own ticking off on separate papers. The waiter insisted that he had to combine them and that he couldn't bring us each our own bill. After much arguing, he eventually relented but it set a sour tone for the evening, and our service was pretty awful all night. Luckily we had decent food in good company and it didn't ruin our night!\n(On a side note, the other couple's bill was over twice what ours was - it would have been quite a pain to try to figure it out on our own, especially after a few drinks!)"

The dim sum came out as it was ready, and it was nearly as good as the dim sum we had in Chinatown in Seattle. The Char Siu buns in particular are not to be missed. It was all hot, tasty, and in good sized portions. \nService: 1 star. Absolutely appalling. We were ignored for about 15 minutes, then caught the attention of the very friendly waiter for the table next to us. We asked him about how ordering works, and as he was getting ready to take our order, the grumpiest man alive came over and brusquely asked what we wanted. It was clear that he was meant to be our waiter but had been nowhere to be seen for 20 minutes. He took our order and stomped off. \nThings did not improve. Dishes came out in a timely manner, but it took us flagging down the friendly waiter to order a second round. Hot water for my tea arrived 10 minutes after my dry flowering tea ball. We ordered steamed buns that have broth in them (and are served with a spoon to catch the broth), but no spoons were brought over. We had to use our soy sauce dishes instead (serendipitously, our soy sauce was empty so we hadn't used the dishes yet). 15 minutes after we asked for our cheque, I again had to flag someone down (a host) and ask for it again. It came, and I spent 10 minutes waiting for the grumpy waiter to look at us so I could get him to bring the card reader.\nAll in all, we spent most of our visit being totally ignored by our waiter, who was incredibly unfriendly. We were pretty frustrated with the automatic 12.5% tip, as well, as he definitely didn't earn a penny of it. \nWe enjoyed the food, but because the overall experience was so poor, we won't be returning."

    "review": "Great atmosphere, decor offset the tasty, but quite small dim sum.\nThis was my first time at Ping Pong. I planned to have a quick lunch armed with my newly registered Ping Pong Loyalty Card, Email for a free cocktail and booking for the Super 8 Menu. The Super 8 menu consisting of a chicken rice pot, tea of your choice, won-ton soup with dumplings, and 5 pre-selected dim sum pieces.\nI opted to sit outside as it was a nice day. It was a little breezy, but every table has a heating element above it, meaning you're not left shivering in late September. I would imagine these would be ineffective when the weather drops below 15 degrees.\nThe staff were pleasant, but there seemed to be a lot of confusion around my cocktail voucher, and to be honest the waiter was clearly new and picking things up. First to arrive was my cocktail. This was a ginger passionfruit crushed ice cocktail. It wasn't very good. Next my complimentary prawn crackers with assortment of dips. Note: you'll need a ping pong loyalty card to get this, but it's free! These were okay. \nThe dim sum arrived shortly after, and I was left slightly puzzled. Normally when I dine chinese, I expect the soup to come first, followed by rice then everything else. I didn't know whether to pick at my tiny dim sum pieces or wait for the soup and rice pot to arrive...after 5 minutes I decide to tuck in. The dim sum was obviously made in house. Both the taste and shapes made it obvious. These weren't your run of the mill production line dim sum. But also left room for skimping on the size. The only one adequate size was the chicken/prawn one. The rest were far too small. If I was paying around \u00a33-4 for 3 pieces I would most definitely be disappointed. However in the context of the deal and extras, it was more than filling. \nAs I polished off 2 of the 5 pieces, the Lychee Red Black scented tea arrived. The aroma was dazzling, and the taste wonderful. Full of flavour and silky smooth without any bitterness. Beautiful. Then finally the rice pot and won-ton soup came. The soup was strange. Tasted nothing like the wonton soup I'm used to and was surprisingly sour. The wonton dumplings were great. Quite large and tasty. The rice pot was the highlight of the meal. The oyster based sauce full of flavour, and plenty of chicken and lots of chinese black mushroom (a delicacy). One of the best rice pots I've ever had. The dipping sauces included chilli oil (all oil, no actual flakes :/), and chilli. The special sauces as a loyalty card holder included chilli black bean sauce (delish), sweet and sour and sesame hoi sin sauce. They were pleasant, but really only the chilli based ones worked with dim sum.\nSo in all, the decor of the place really impressed. Somebody really though about the experience visually. Unfortunately the food (in respect to the dim sum) is below average and the order dishes arrive is a little random. Two things that wouldn't take a lot of effort to improve. Otherwise it has all the small touches I appreciate. Unprotected wifi, loyalty card scheme, lovely interior, unique tea blends. Lets see the major food points fixed, and this place would be an easy 5 stars."

I was craving steamed buns, so we were determined to get in despite the queue that was trailing outside of the restaurant. We barely managed to get food, however, and our experience was utterly tainted by overburdened staff and misinformation- I can confidently say we will continue to avoid Ping Pong for future as a potential dining venue.\nIn particular, we were told that the waiting time for a two person table would be 20 minutes, but it was at least a 40 minute wait before anyone made any effort to seat us. Only after we complained were we directed to a communal table, so we put our foot down and demanded a two person arrangement as we had originally requested. To our astonishment, we were then swiftly seated. \nWe nearly had to physically grab a server because we were having difficulties getting anyone's attention and were forced to order all of our food in a frenzy while stressing that we only had 20 minutes to dine. The server attempted to be congenial and arrange for our bill to be presented immediately to help speed things up, but was still very slow in manifesting this and to take payment. We had no sauces on our table and asked another passing server for these, but they never arrived and we ended up sharing with our neighbours. Our table was literally so close to both adjacent tables that we were pinned to the wall as well- it was the most stressful and uncomfortable meal I have experienced in recent memory.\nIt must be acknowledged that they did honour an NUS discount and that I have previously eaten at other, smaller and speedier branches of Ping Pong in the past, but the Southbank branch is best avoided if you wish to enjoy a relaxing meal. I can barely recall the quality of the food because we were so dissatisfied with the visit and were forced to voraciously stuff everything in our faces, but I recall that the steamed buns that I did order would have otherwise proved satisfactory as they are a specialty of the chain."

Then the waiter returns with your order form, and as the food is prepared and arrives steaming hot to your table, he crosses the dishes out one by one from the list. \nIt's a great flexible system that can accommodate both snacky and havn't-eaten-in-days customers with the same ease as you basically tailormake your own menu.

This one is in prime location, South Bank. Also nice decoration and always busy, even upstairs at the bar. That tells me that Ping Pong is doing something right. So I went in with high expectations. A fragrant cocktail at a very reasonable price (hibiscus mojito, why yes I'll have more please) started the evening well. Then we attempted the dim sum. Drum roll please. Well, in my head anyway. \nThe Dim Sum was nice, good selection and tasty indeed. I felt slightly overpriced for what you were getting, especially considering Chinatown isn't a million miles away and hidden in there are some SUPERB cheaper places (if you know where to look). Don't get me wrong, a wonderful evening - don't go for a cheap meal (don't get dim sum if you want a cheap meal to be honest) but I would go again. Mainly for the cocktails, but considering this is my favourite kind of cuisine EVER I was satisfied. Yes readers, that is Daniel P and his high standards... ;)"

The food was delicious - I chose from the preset menu, and everything on it was great. I didn't like that we couldn't make a reservation unless there was at least 6 of us, and they didn't bring us the checklists back, so we were unsure as to who ordered what some of the time. Overall, a great experience, and I would return when I'm back in the UK!"

I had some non alcoholic drinks ie.. the Lemon and Lychee, and iced teas such as the lemongrass and passion fruit and lime... I loved them all. The lemongrass was amazing because it wasn't overly sweet and quenched my thirst and felt less sugar infused. All the dim sums where amazing im getting hungry just writing this."

    "review": "This is the kind of place where I believe timing is essential to your experience. To me, it was busy and loud in all the wrong ways. Coming in on a Thursday night at 7:30PM, I immediately thought to myself that the noise level was way out of hand. Even though we were just three people at the start of the evening, I could not make out what the other two were talking about, even though they were sitting next to me. \nMy grumpy mood might have been affected by my hunger, because it was soon forgotten as  the food and drinks finally arrived. In short, the dim sum was all in all pretty good. Not mind-blowingly good, but for the price I was more than satisfied. The dim sums are a bit \"fusion\" - far from any classic dim sum restaurant in Chinatown, but they cater well to a Western palate with safe choices like honey glazed ribs and the like. No boiled hen feet on this menu ...\nAlthough you can't go wrong with the beers they serve, we definitely went wrong with the drinks. The mojito they serve, of which two of us ordered, was the worst I have had. 90% ice, very bitter, and not a hint of any booze in there at all. We ended up returning ours. We had a couple of others that seemed alright, among those a  passion fruit drink. All in all I just think drinks are not their forte."

    "review": "In a word: YUM!!!\nI came here last week with some friends and we loved this place! The overall vibe is trendy, modern, and just generally cool. We arrived at around 8:15pm on a Tuesday night and the place was packed! With the promise of being seated in 15 minutes, we put our names on the list, took a buzzer, and decided to get a drink in the lounge upstairs.\nThe lounge is outfitted with plush seating and sleek wooden tables. While the space looks pretty, it's a bit impractical. The seats are quite low and packed closely together, which is inconvenient for my fellow members of Team Long Legs. Also, the lounge features table service, but there was no clear host/hostess on the night that I visited. I think my friends and I caused a bit of a kerfuffle amongst the staff when we 1) seated ourselves and 2) ordered drinks from someone who wasn't assigned to our table. Welp I don't feel bad because better service procedures would have avoided the confusion.\nWhen our buzzer finally rang 30 minutes later (!!), we returned downstairs to one of the circular family-style tables. Our waitress recommended that each person order five dishes. I'm not entirely sure how ravenous one would have to be to order that much food, but I was very hungry and very satisfied with two dim sum dishes, one rice pot, and a lite bite. All my items were delicious, filling, and well worth the money!\nThe one other issue that I had with Ping Pong was our waitress. Le sigh, here comes the classic \"bad British service\" complaint. But seriously, our waitress rolled her eyes at my friend when she asked for a different liquor in her cocktail, which the lounge hostess upstairs specifically told us was an acceptable request. Then when we asked to split the bill, our waitress handed us a pencil and told us to split it ourselves. I personally didn't have a problem with that because I assumed that doing the math ourselves ensured that everyone paid for their own items. After our waitress took the divided dim sum sheet from us, she returned with receipts that did not match the sums that we calculated for her. On top of that, she added 12.5% gratuity. I did not recall seeing a note about automatic gratuity on the menu. I would certainly expect that for a party of 6+, but not for 3 people! And certainly not for such mediocre service. We all paid it anyways because we didn't want to cause a scene. \nI think I'd return to Ping Pong for the food and the atmosphere, but I'd just avoid that particularly rubbish waitress."

    "review": "First of all, if you want a true dim sum experience, there are better places in Chinatown.  And that says a lot.  You lose that authentic ambiance without the rolling carts bustling about.  Not to mention that the selection is missing a lot of the more \"ethnic\" gems.  I suppose much of this is to be expected given the clientele of the establishment.  *cough*cough* NOT ASIAN *cough*cough*  Ping Pong is more of a white-washed, fusion restaurant catering mostly to bland taste buds.\nWith that being said, if you look hard enough, you will be able to find some tasty options on the Dim Sum menu that take a few steps away from standard Chinese dishes.  Be prepared to use a lot of sauce to capture the flavor though.\n   ~ Five stars:  The Crispy Prawn Balls.  Superb, and unique.  A flaky and crispy shell with a thick, paste of a filling.  Pretty heavy.  These were the favorite of the night.\n   ~ Five stars: Hoi Sin Vegetable Puff.  Also a favorite, crunchy and light.  I could have eaten five more of these.\n   ~ Five stars: The Honey Glazed Spare Ribs.  So popular that night, that they ended up running out.  I was pleasantly surprised and would have ordered more if they didn't run out.\n   ~ Four stars: Steamed Sichuan Rabbit Dumpling.  Mmmm, rabbit.  This is a seasonal special.  The leanness of the rabbit paired well with the hearty steamed bun shell and syrupy sauce.\n   ~ Three stars: The Crispy Duck Spring Rolls.  It's actually an egg roll.  Still, I pretty much love anything with duck, so long as it's prepared right.  The Hoi Sin Sauce is obviously what made this dish delicious, but I also found the duck to be tender and flavorful.  \nNote that each selection comes in a set of three.  So if you're with a party of four, order doubles of each dish?  \nTotal came to around \u00a311 per person for a group of three.  We ordered no drinks, except hot tea.  There is a \"Set Menu for 1\" deal priced at \u00a39.95 per person that includes a single serving portion from 10 different dishes, but the selection isn't that fantastic.\nI'm used to putting up with bland food while I'm staying in London.  The taste buds here are atrocious.  And honestly, though most of the food selections were underwhelming, I was still pleasantly surprised with many of our selections.  Not to mention that Ping Pong is a frequented establishment for many of my friends.  \nWhile I'm sure that at any other time, I would have awarded Ping Pong with just three stars, I found the complimentary hot tea a nice gesture, the overall price affordable and decent, the atmosphere cool and chic, the service fast, the bathrooms clean, and the location convenient."

We had to wait a bit to get a seat so we sat at the bar and waited for a long while to get served- you may need to accost a waiter to get a drink, they seem a little \"toff\" biased.\nHowever, we chose 3 dishes between the two of us, from a VEGAN menu- yes folks, I was really impressed that they had a seperate menu, awesome huh? That's pretty much why I rated high, because I found the food to be really tasty, especially the vegetable-y rice packaged in leaves, and the mushroom parcels. Although, the 3 dishes between us and 3 drinks came to nearly \u00a330, I went home and devoured a sandwich. For a solo meal, perhaps 2 dishes would be ideal as you get 3 bits of each so you can share.\nAnyway, great food, slightly squished seating, the toilets were clean and smelled LOVELY (a bit like bubblegum), and the service was fairly slow getting the order and paying but not sniffy, just busy although the food arrived nice and quickly!\nThe flower teas are beautiful, and if you live in East london near Shoreditch, They even deliver- lucky!"

I've never known defeat like it. \nWhat lets this branch down, though obviously too is a plus, is its location on the busy  chain & tourist fest that is the Southbank. You cannot book, so on one busy Sunday we were turned away, and they are always busy so you have no other choice than to savour one of their delicious cocktails; juices; wines in the bar while you wait. You also need to be prepared to be seated with others while you dine. Sometimes this doesn't bother me but when you are trying to eat your own bodyweight in dim sum and you and your friends want an adult conversation, you'd rather it not be listened in on by tourist's and their young son! \nThe staff were friendly and the service was good / quick considering how busy it was but I would rather not return to this branch."

We waited about 20 minutes which wasn't bad at all. Price seemed very reasonable. Service was pleasant, our server made some suggestions when asked for that were all happily accepted and enjoyed when served.  And we didn't feel rushed which on a Saturday night is very appreciated.

It does, however, defy another semi-truism about London:  It is not always easy to find a delicious meal in a good restaurant for reasonable price.  \nMy family and I ate lunch here.  We were sat at a tale with some other guests - a move I always find cozy and quite conducive to friendly feeling meal.  (Conducive that is unless you are sat next to the Adams Family or Stalin.)  The decor was a zen sand garden, rocks of tables place gracefully among carefully raked sand.  \nMy family and I ordered a variety of dishes as one often does in dim sum.  Some steamed dumplings with prawn, some veggies with spice wrapped in something quite nice made of rice), soup, steamed rice, and more.  All items (soup excluded) came in sets of three like the Triplets of Belleville.  We were more content than a hoard of otters playing in the water.  Everything made our stomachs cry out with joyous choruses of \"hallelujah!\".  \nOur soprano, mezzo soprano, alto and baritone converged into a chorus golden as Orpheus strumming his lyre.  The bill came to about 7 or 8 per person.  We didn't eat heavy, but we ate enough, and walked out light on our feet.  \nThe only deceiving aspect was that no paddles and ping pong balls were provided as a diversion.

Fast, friendly with no fuss. \nMy biggest complaint was the food: way too expensive for what it was. \nAs a steamed dumpling fiend, the chicken Shu Mai hit the stomach in the right place and in truth, there's something here for all tastes. Thing is, though there's lot of different things to eat, there isn't a lot to eat.\nCall me old school but i like to have a lot of Dim Sum on a few plates, rather than half a dozen platters holding three so-so parcels each. You'll eat but you won't be getting satisfied any time this side of the Rapture. \nPing Pong's all a bit too sanitised and lacks surprise. As for the drinks make sure you actually receive liquid rather than a tumbler full of ice.\n \nConsidering that there was no alcohol involved, the best part of one hundred pounds for a meal, after which i felt hungry again wasn't a good advert for the popular chain.\nThe saving grace i guess was the location, on London's perennially busy South Bank but you can't eat a view can you?"

My Monday morning blues are immense and the vibe at my office is bleak, so my colleague and I decide to head out for some comfort food on our lunch hour.

    "review": "Best dim sum I've ever had? No, probably not. Fun and enjoyable afternoon with good company and tasty food? Yes, definitely!\nOn arrival at Ping Pong, I was nervous that the table that I'd booked for 10 people late last night online via the Ping Pong web site would not be available since I didn't receive an email confirmation. But I need not have worried since as soon as I arrived and asked about \"my reservation for 10 people\", we were whisked upstairs to the lounge/bar/dining area. I have been to this branch of Ping Pong once before, but hadn't realised that there was an upstairs area. However, I was very pleased by this as a) there was only one other group upstairs besides us; b) it was much quieter which allowed us to chat to our hearts' content; and c) the sofas were much more comfortable than the benches downstairs albeit slightly lower. At this point, a big tick for Ping Pong's technological advances and wise decision about seating allocations. \nWe ordered our drinks (all choosing fancy teas of varying fanciness - my favourite of the ones I tried was the lychee and ginger iced tea cooler, which was very refreshing) and settled in to analyse the menu. Another tick for Ping Pong on a special occasion for the wide range of teas that we don't normally have when we go for a traditional dim sum meal.\nThe girls chose a selection of dim sum for the group, which the boys promptly tripled... The food arrived quickly and was served hot and fresh. The flavour complemented each other well - I love Ping Pong for the variety of unusual combinations (like black prawn dumplings). My only criticism is that the steamed dim sum were a bit too sticky, which meant the skins broke and the contents spilled out. We were also slightly disappointed that they did not have cheung fun on the menu. But decent quality food all in all. \nWe also had desserts - the Ping Pong sampler, which I won't describe in detail as it would spoil the surprise - but each mouthful was was delicious and only made you want more. I'm glad I managed to squeeze in dessert!\nOverall, we had a great afternoon - great company and lots of food. However, I think it is over priced (in my opinion, you can get much better traditional dim sum at a very reasonable price), but you do get the more unusual/fusion combinations (like scallop and shitake dumplings, duck spring rolls or seafood pastries). That said, we got what we paid for - a slightly different, very relaxed lunchtime gathering of friends."

    "review": "Ping Pong opened the last year I was with my old company, and we had our departmental Christmas dinner at the original branch opposite the London Palladium. It was packed solid, and I remember it was difficult to get a booking. I had the day off due to moving into my new home that day and met my shortly to be ex-colleagues for what was a very fun evening, with delicious, madly affordable food served in a gorgeous setting. My boss managed to give me no sign I was to be fired right after Christmas.\n My fondness for Ping Pong survived this incident and I went back with my now ex-colleagues (minus the boss) for a catch-up about 6 months later, after the legal wrangling was completed. Again, it was fun.\n And I've been back subsequently with very different crowds  once with my houseguests in the summer, after a performance of The Sound of Music at the Palladium, and last week with my brother and the niece and nephew after our Royal Society lecture.\n Both visits were great. I think my older guests enjoyed themselves  the Jasmine tea is always a show-stopper  and they are the type of older visitors who appreciate an experience of 'trendy' London. The dim sum were duly demolished while friendly banter was exchanged with a couple down from the North at our communal table.\n Some critics have sniffily compared Ping Pong to Hakkasan and Yauatcha. I think the Ping Pong dim sum stand up very well, considering Ping Pong is aiming at a completely different market: mostly the post work crowd; with the dim sum hoovering up alcohol consumption.\n The trip to the new branch at the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank was a wonderful half-term family treat. We arrived just after 8pm, me thinking innocently that there would be a lull as punters left for performances at the Hall. Ha ha ha. The place was hopping, with a queue snaking out the door. We were told we had a half-hour wait but would shortly be moved into a bar area. I asked if the kids could have a snack while they waited, and my brother started complaining we couldn't wait 30 minutes with the children 'at this hour'. I mentioned there was an EAT around the corner  but my nephew bridled at this (EAT is clearly their default pit stop in Cambridge). Also, he had spotted the Chinese script on the ceiling and wanted more.\n We were asked to hang on for 5 minutes and a table was magicked up for us. I was really impressed they even bothered, considering they had flocks of people to spare. Service was brilliant and slick, and the dim sum arrived smartly. Stand-outs were the Har Gau and the squid in satay sauce. The Jasmine tea blew the children away  my little nephew thought it was an alien pod hatching.\n The dim sum are keenly priced for such a glam atmosphere  the most expensive item is \u00a33.99: each menu item comes with 3 portions, allowing easy sharing. My nephew had a series of lemonades with fruit 'shooters'  these were as phenomenally beautiful as the jasmine tea. My brother and I stuck to G&Ts  quite fabulously delicious. These were Tanqueray but on a completely different plane to others I have had recently. 3 G&Ts = half the bill for 4 (12 courses) : \u00a367 including service."

    "review": "Went to Ping Pong last night with a couple of friends. I'm quite a fan but they've certainly gone down hill recently.\nNow we hadn't booked a table and I do have to commend them on getting us seated pretty quickly on a busy night. However, we were told to go upstairs to the bar where we then had to queue for a table. Being in a queue because we're already in another queue really isn't great.\nWe were called pretty quickly but were unfortunately sat outside on one of the coldest nights of the summer so far. They wouldn't switch the outdoor heaters on so we spent a good part of the evening shivering.\nThe food we chose wasn't bad at all but nowhere near as good as what I'd had before. The pork buns were a delight as usual but the rest wasn't much to write home (or a review) about. Much of it was fairly tasteless and much of it all tasted the same. Was it chicken, prawn or something entirely different? It leaves you wondering whether they've labelled the boxes not because people don't know what each piece should look like but because people need help identifying it when they've got it in their mouth.\nDue to the cold we all drank tea to try and warm ourselves up and I had to admit that the lychee tea is rather lovely. The cocktails did look lovely and most are priced around the \u00a36 mark so definitely worth a shot if you're sat out not in sub-arctic conditions.\nThe bill came to \u00a345 between three of us which wasn't too awful although I did have to buy a bag of crisps on my way home to keep my stomach quiet."

Being from Vancouver, where Chinese food is practically the local cuisine, I have high standards for my dim sum, and I (mostly) wasn't disappointed!\nThe decor and menu were interesting, and we ordered round after round of the yummy dim sum - 10 orders and prawn chips between 3 of us. \nFavourites included the crispy prawn balls (we ordered a second round of these) and the shu mai. The crab spring roll, shrimp har gow and prawn and shitake dumplings were also delicious. \nFor me, the only miss was the veggie steambuns- wayyyy too sweet for my taste.\nThe cocktail list was fresh and inventive - I tried a fennel and apple martini, a basil, lemon and black pepper martini and a vanilla vodka lemonade that tasted like Lucky Charms. Yum! Just one question - when we order mixed fancy fruity cocktails here in Vancouver, they are generally made with 2 ounces of liquor, but I am sure that these were just made with one. I noticed this a few other places in London - is this standard?\nThe service really petered off by the end of the night - in order to make this a five star experience the wait staff really needs to keep the standards high thoughout the whole night. \nOn the whole, give it a try!"

Its stylishly designed over too floors, and upstairs is a cocktail lounge bar where you can meet friends before your meal. \nThe service is very fast, and the dim sum is deliscious. This is a great place to meet a large group of friends - the circular tables allow you to see everyone at the same time. And you can share a large variety of food, and get pleasingly sloshed on the excellent cocktails before taking a short walk along the river to watch a movie. Low lighting and candles make it a good romantic spot in the evening too."

Colleagues highly recommended Ping Pong (which I kept calling Polka dot all day.. but that's neither here nor there). I went here with high expectations and left somewhat disappointed.. and 50.00 poorer.. and kind of hungry still. \nHubby and I shared 8 plates and each got soup. My soup was the best part of the meal. I got the hot & Sour soup- flavorful and spicy and very good. For food we got the mushroom oyster (not great), the spicy pork dumplings (decent but really mushy), black bean pastry things (awful, tasted like burnt pie crust), black seafood dumplings (extremely good, but small- order a few!), prawns wrapped in shrimp (ok, but  lacking much flavor), sticky rice wrapped in some kind of tough leaves (not very good), Crunchy spring rolls (good, but standard fried food) and squid cakes (just ok, nothing to write home about). \nEach plate was somewhere between 3-4GBP. altogether we spent almost 50.00 and i left still pretty hungry but not wanting to spend anymore money on food there!\nAtmosphere was nice.

All top-notch.\n I went here on Saturday night - I've been there when it's been busy before, and it was fine, but this time around we should have seen the warning signs when we were handed one of those stupid pager things that Student Unions hand out if you're waiting for a burger and chips. After waiting for a table in the bar, we then had to literally wave at the waiters to get somebody to take our drinks order.\n When we eventually got a table to eat at, we discovered that a lot of food on the menu was 'not available' - much to our disappointment. The food, when it arrived, was delicious as ever, but then when the mains were finished, a bill was whacked down on our table, without even asking if we wanted dessert or tea, seemingly in an attempt to turn the table around quicker. We were given a dessert menu after a request... but then had a bizarrely epic wait to get the bill at the end.\n What used to be a great restaurant is now swamped and understaffed on busy nights - leaving yourself up against a bizarre conflict of staff who one minute seem desparate to get you out of the table, and the next are impossibly hard to get ahold of in order to take orders / provide service. Dining is supposed to be relaxing, not leaving you stressed at constant efforts to get the attention of staff, as you squeeze around a communal table that is simply not big enough for the food of all of the dining groups.\n At \u00a375 for 2 including service, it ends up leaving me with a horribly nasty taste in the mouth. The food was great, but did I have a pleasurable dining experience? Not in the slightest. The staff tried their best, but there just wasn't enough of them.\n I would not go to the South Bank Ping Pong again, at least not on the weekend. I think I'll be returning to a quieter branch in future..."

    "review": "Expensive, swankified dim sum is nearly always a disappointment. Ping Pong is no exception.\nImagine a huge restaurant filled with bustling carts piled high with steamers chock full of plump dumplings, plates of just sauteed vegetables, dishes teeming with crispy fried squid, pushed by no-nonsense ladies who don't speak English and cut your taro root with scissors in front of you at your crowded, noisy table of 8 people about to burst with tiny dishes. Makes me hungry just thinking about it. \nPong pong is nothing like that. Portions are small, the decor is trying hard for a lounge feel, and they serve pricey martinis. But even if you really want a chichi martini with your pork dumplings, at least those pork dumplings and those martinis should be good. And you should get more than 3 in an order for a dish costing over \u00a33.\nI realize I have high expectations for Chinese food, particularly dim sum. But this place is a perfect example of promoting atmosphere over taste and charging way too much for something that is designed to be cheap and delicious. If you're not going for the food, maybe you'll love it!"

    "review": "I went to Ping Pong last Sunday with an open mind and bear in mind I've had Dim Sum only once in Chinatown as a reference.\n Ping Pong from the outside looks nice and impressive. Equally the d\u00e9cor seemed okay inside.\n Being two of us they did ask if we wanted to sit immediately if we didn't mind being in the sun. It was absolutely fine I add.\n We considered the Unlimited menu but wondered whether we'd really eat that much bearing in mind the price of \u00a318.79(?) does not cover drinks and some items of the menu.\n Ping Pong do Dim Sum and they do it well. The two most memorable ones were the Black Prawn steamed dumplings and the one with Turmeric. I notice they sell them as three's so one each and then you have to split the third?\n It's not all perfect: I found a piece of clear plastic in my mouthful from one of the Claypot selections.\nI knew I had to highlight this and the waitress quickly said she would get the Manager who apologised and offered us a couple of glasses of wine on the house.\n Prior to this episode, the first steamed Broccoli that was delivered to the table was like mush and was sent back. The second one that came was exactly the same. More about this later.\n We hadn't had breakfast and ate quite a lot, more than we needed to. If we had gone for the Unlimited, we'd have made a small saving each - say the equivalent of one dish so be certain you are going to eat a lot.\n I thought the set menus looked good and took a lot of hassle out of what to order. Any feedback from others on their value?\n Back to Broccoli: When it came to paying I pointed out to the Waitress that the Broccoli had been mush. She just said sorry.\nThen whilst waiting for the other half near the exit the Manager came over to say goodbye and we had a little cordial chat. He asked me if everything else was okay and I asked how the broccoli should have been served. Apparently crispy (with a bite).\nI told him about mine and in reply he told me how hard it was to monitor so much being steamed especially on a Sunday.\n Is that a reasonable excuse? I don't think so. I rarely have fault to complain so never too sure what to expect when I do - not that I was on the Broccoli - I was giving feedback though I should have mentioned that \u00a33.79 for a tiny portion of steamed Broccoli is a rip-off.\n Will I go again? I think I'll give it a miss and find that place in Chinatown."

It was *appallingly* slow and inattentive; I literally had to thrust my order into one of the waitstaff's hands in order for them to actually notice we were ready to order and take it. Not good at all. While the food came reasonably quickly afterwards, there was complete failure to clear empty dishes, and we eventually had to ask (twice!) for the bill.\nThe food was merely okay... yes, it was dim sum, but not exactly good dim sum. Their interpretation of bao was undercooked, their jiaozi were quite good but also slightly undercooked, the prawn toasts reasonably good, the wonton broth rather gritty and tasteless (although the wontons themselves were fair)... you get the picture.\nFortunately, the company I was with saved the evening from being a total disaster -- along with the actually quite acceptably tasting (but VERY weak!) cocktails. It's not worth the premium they charge though, I'm afraid. Overpriced, ineffective dim sum -- there are better places to go in London!"

    "review": "Ping Pong is a themed chain of restaurants that sell modern Asian food, in particular dim-sum. They are usually well decorated and usually quite busy.\n At the Waterloo branch you sit as in most of the locations around small tables, asian style. Let me start in a rather petty way by saying they're uncomfortable little things and don't lend themselves to long stay. Staying at a place for a reasonable length of time is something that high prices should allow but in the case of Ping-Pong it's not always the case.\n Foodwise, they have a great little menu that's got a lot of lovely items on. There's seafood dim-sum, which appears to be a speciality as well as the usual assorted steamed and fried dishes. Since it's somewhat Western in influence these aren't as authentic as a Chinatown place, but it's a good start.\n The dishes though are expensive, as another reviewer pointed out this is quite shocking considered the very small portions. In addition when I visited it was very easy for the server to seem to get confused and bring us the dishes for the other tables.\nAs an example of the price comparison, the 'special' flower tea they sell can be found for 1/10th the price in supermarkets There's a lot of mark-up on the 'exotic' nature of the products they are selling, so you need to be aware of this.\n So, overall on the food It's good, tasty and varied, but oh-so-small portions and so expensive. Very much a 3 star if you're with a group, or on a business lunch. However I actually only rate it a 2 once you factor in that you can't really justify the prices if it's only two of you dining."

Handily, there is a bar upstairs where you can wait (and buy expensive cocktails, obviously) and a fair ticketing system so there's little chance that you'll have enough material to write a half hour sitcom here.\n In the end we only had to wait about 15 minutes as we didn't mind sharing a table with other people. The seating in the restaurant was nice to look at but, because you're sharing a semicircular bench with someone else you do have to co-ordinate yourselves to get it in the right position. The table we sat at was for 8 and it would have been great if we'd all been together but with all that dim sum on the table it felt a little cramped trying to keep our stuff on our little quarter.\n It's a great idea to have dim sum as the entire menu as in a proper Chinese restaurant you can only get it at a certain time of day. In comparison to dim sum I've had before the menu is quite small and eclectic. But the food that we ordered was good. They asked us if we had ever been to a Harvester, I mean Ping Pong, before we ordered so it's clearly aimed at people who have never savoured the delights of dim sum before and my friend (who never has) loved it. Because the portions are smaller you feel that you can be a bit more adventurous with the menu. The waitress advised us to get 5 dishes each!! but I assured my friend that 3 each should be enough and it was.\n It was great fun in here - less brash than dim sum at a Chinese restaurant but less speedy and less menu but fun all the same. If you want authentic dim sum, though, I would recommend any Chinese restaurant instead."

Dishes arrive sporadically at your table, we were given one of our dishes twice plus something we didn't order and then had to argue over what we had and hadn't received as we were still waiting for one of our dishes long after everything else was finished.\n If they can work on the service element it would be a lot better but the food is fun and the location is convenient.

I know some restaurants just happen to have big investment behind, so they afford to have best locations, no matter what they serve, or how bad is the service, people just flood in.. unless you have no place to eat, otherwise, don't bother. go to Ping Pong, just waste your money! go to china town, you can get better dimsum and better service!"

    "review": "You always have to wait to get a seat here because it gets very crowded- you can only book seats if you are in a group of 8 or more. The dim sum is great and it is rare to find a place where this type of food is emphasised. They say that you should order 5 dishes per person, but I would say that three is more than enough, But it is nice that you can almost pic and mix and have a nice range of fillings. Or you can go all out and share with friends- the round table s assist this. I am a fan of the seafood dim sum, this seems to be the special one. The bar and cocktails are equally pleasing, but do come here for the food. Prices are pricey, so keep ping pong for special occaisions!"

    "review": "The ultimate dimsum restaurant, this funky, cool and popular restaurant sits proudly on the southbank down from the BFI and National Theatre. It literally does one thing, and does it well - offers dim sum. And lots of it. You are presented with menus and a piece of paper reminiscent of a cluedo sheet, which you mark according to what you want to eat, not with what implement you think Colonel Mustard used in the Ballroom. They then take the sheet and return with plates and plates of delicious goodies. I particularly recommend the duck spring rolls and the crispy prawn balls, but the har gau dumplings are amazing and you must eat some of the sticky rice which comes wrapped in a leaf. Oh, and you can't leave without trying the kumquat mojito. Summink Else!"

    "review": "First time I've been here, there were 10 of us, which was frankly too many for the circular tables. Best to go with two or three people. Unused to picking the food as well, which basically involves ticking a paper list after studying the menu, and then handing your choices to the waiter, who was very attentive, constantly filling our glasses with water. I had the duck spring rolls, which were delicious, the pork bun, likewise delicious, and a hot and sour soup, which was a tiny portion that quite disappointed me. 23, 26 and 138. The toilets here are very strange and deserve a mention. Basically you wash your hands by putting them underneath a counter, at which point you may encounter female hands, as teh water is shared with the girls toilets. This is just odd, as naughty pervert girls can look straight at the urinals. Splitting the bill caused a few problems as we had all decided to split evenly before the meal, then some people only wanted to pay for two courses, but it was still good value, I ended up paying \u00a311.20 for three servings which would have cost me about \u00a39.60 had I been on my own, which is a pretty good ratio when I remember some of the shared bills I experienced at places such as Pizza Express, where the wine drinkers and bread eaters benefited tremendously."

And when I booked my table I hoped and prayed to be seated in the middle of all the floral glory, with the warm lighting reflected on the mirrors surrounding the room. \nTo my pleasant surprise, I managed to be seated with my partner, on my birthday in this beautiful room I had imagine for so long. \nIt is the most beautiful restaurant I have been to till date, without a doubt. However, I do feel that with all the reviews and pictures I had previously seen, I was not taken aback by the fact that I was in the room...\n... quite simply, the excitement of the restaurant is so highly televised that I was not taken with surprise the way I had imagined. \nYes I was in this beautifully decorated romantic restaurant\nYes, it was in my birthday\nYes, with my partner \nAnd yet I expected more. \nThe restaurant itself is very small and you feel very intimate not only with your partner but with everyone else in the room. The mirrors make it appear deceptively bigger than it is. \nOne thing I cannot fault, is the service. Neither my partner or myself are the most flamboyant or immaculately dressed, however, we received a very warm service. \nIf you are not used to fine dining, you may occasionally within this small boogie setting, feel out of place.

The service was good, but not compared to the US. The decor is very masculine. If you're really big on service then you may get slightly annoyed. They did some odd things. For example, if we were finished with a dish, one person would move it to the edge of the table instead of taking it.... our salad came after we had already been eating our entree... I don't mean to be knit picky but when you expect fine dining, you should expect fine service, and I was disappointed. \nWe were given some butter with sea salt and small pot of biscuits, in addition to the bread service. We bought a bottle of the Foxglove Zinfandel and started with the Marcellin's Heritage Shoulder of Loire Valley Rabbit. To be honest, I thought it was just very slightly over cooked. About half of my portion was dry, but for the rest, I felt all the elements were really deliciously and elegantly put together. \nFor our entree we both had the Oven Roasted Welsh Rack of Lamb and Chargrilled Belly. They first brought out the lamb to show us before it was plated. I found this step to be very Interesting and it allowed us to really smell the lamb and prepare our taste buds for the dish. This was absolutely delicious! And the best lamb I've ever had. I highly recommend this! It didn't have a strong lamb flavor so if you generally don't like super gamey meats, this is still really tasty! For dessert we had the whites chocolate mousse and fresh gariguette 'volupt\u00e9' we almost licked the plate clean. We were given a complimentary plate of small bite desserts as well. \nI will definitely be coming back for the food."

    "review": "Clos Maggiore is a romantic oasis in the heart of Covent Garden. Their warm and intimate influence comes from the country inns of Provence and Tuscany. Clos Maggiore is ranked one of the worlds most romantic restaurants. It feels magical even on the outside of the restaurant. It was the most magical anniversary celebrated since our wedding day :) \nAs one enters Close Maggiore, you are immediately greeted by the hostess to check in and have your coats received. The hostess will then bring you into the waiting room with a beverage of your choice. The waiting room is dimly lit for a sexy and foxy ambiance.  \nHubby made a late reservation at 9:30pm. Feedback states you are most likely to get a seat in the observatory with a later reservation than with an early reservation. This feedback was true as we had did get a table in the observatory. A nice cozy corner table to snuggle together under the stars on a romantic and magical December night :) \nThe whole restaurant is beautiful and breathtaking, but the observatory is unforgettable. The conservatory is a fully retractable glass roof that is normally adorned with cherry blossoms. When we visited it was adored with rustic wood branches intertwined with greenery, Christmas lights, and Christmas ornaments. The lighting was romantic with a fusion of the starlight sky above, crackling warm fireplace in the back, Christmas lights everywhere, and a delicate candle lit on our table. \nChef Marcellin Marc's love of Provencal can be experienced not only in the decor, but also in the cuisine. The dishes created from sourced local and seasonal products throughout the year to create their awarded AA-rosette award menus. One can read more details about the sourcing of ingredients on their website. It is quiet fascinating. Hubby and I both ordered items from the seasonal tasting menu. The quality of the ingredients are exceptional. One can taste the quality in every bite. \nClos Maggiore believes that wine is a fundamental part of dining. Therefore they a dedicated team of Sommeliers that visit vineyards and taste hundreds of wines a year. This teamwork has produced a globally renowned wine cellar that boasts an extensive 2500 options from 18 different countries and four centuries. The restaurant has won multiple awards for their wines including one of the highest and most prestigious accolades - 'The Wine Spectator Grand Award' - one of only 70 restaurants worldwide to have achieved this honour. Lastly, they now incorporate \"Coravin\" wine preservation system so you can order by the glass. \nSuch a fabulous restaurant is not fabulous without its staff. The service deserves a round of applause. Outstanding from the minute of arrival to departure. Intimate service never left me sit waiting for the next course, or with crumbs on the table. Truly wonderful. My favorite was the surprise was at the end. The staff provided a special \"Happy Anniversary\" dish. This topped off an already beyond perfect night. Thank you! Words cannot express enough how thankful I am to the staff. \nLondon has so much to see and offer. I would highly recommend making time to visit this restaurant. It is on par with several one Michelin star restaurants in London. In addition, it's not just a restaurant, but an experience you will remember for many years. \nThank you Clos Maggiore!"

I honestly wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my friends."

    "review": "It's taken me a while to muster up the courage to write this review. Mostly just because I made a reservation 6 months in advance because that's how long the wait time is, so naturally, I was expecting to be blown away. But shoot, how can you not put so much pressure on the place and have your expectations high as heck when you wait 6 months to eat there!? Basically, what happened was I wasn't blown away, and I was sad because I wanted to be. But whatever, I'm going to write about it mostly just for myself because I'm strange and enjoy re-reading my reviews and remembering the experience. Also people may be interested in my point of view, but I really don't want anyone to be put off from going here because of me. \nThe conservatory room is the one room that has the ungodly wait for it. If you want a weekend dinner slot, it'll probably be more like 8 months + for a spot. They have plenty of other tables in other rooms that you don't have to wait that long for, but I was all about the special room because it's awesome to surprise yourself on a  random weeknight in January and the prices seemed semi-reasonable for a wait time like that. So anyway LETS GET TO IT! \nWe were welcomed and they took our coats and seated us. They put us at a table situation in the middle of the room. It's a relatively small square room and there are tables placed in the corners and side of the room, and then there's a round one smack in the middle. We were at that table and it felt sort of in the centre of everything, not terribly intimate, and we had to sit across from one another so he felt sort of far away from me. It also gave the waiters 4 different angles to approach us, which meant we were checked on a lot. All of these things seem very minimal, but I guess they began to add up over time. We thought it would be a super calm, chill, and relaxing evening, but because there were so many people to take care of us it was not relaxing. Probably 3 different waiters tried to take our order before we were ready. It's not really their fault, that's just what happens when you don't have a set waiter for a set table I guess. I also asked to hold on to the menu, and a second later, another waiter took it up, because that's what happens when you have so many people attending to you! \nIt was also quite funny, because there was so much confusion around the tasting menu. We wanted to know if it was possible to order a vegetarian tasting menu and also a fish only one, and they got quite confused. One waiter had to get another to come over and then another came over which made me quite embarrassed thinking that this question wasn't that big of a deal. It also felt like everyone was looking at us because we were literally in the centre of the room. In the end they told us we could only pick 2 options of the 5 and it was to the point where we just though, \"ok, I guess we should just stop asking questions\". I still don't get how the tasting menu works. \nThe food was good. We had the Spanish octopus salad and crab and salmon roulade for starters. The octopus salad had plenty of sausage in it which I was not expecting. Ok ok, it does say \"Pig's Trotter Croquet and young leaves\" in smaller print underneath. Derp. The salmon roulade and crab was very tasty. \nFor mains we had turbot and the truffle pasta with a side of truffle mashed potatoes and mushrooms. To be honest those sides were totally out of this world and I would have been happy just eating those with the complimentary cheese puff things they give you. Their bread (especially the focaccia! is also delicious. \nI really did enjoy the truffle pasta, but wasn't a fan of the turbot. The room is very beautiful and I can imagine it being even more lovely during the daytime with all the natural light and lovely flowers. We enjoyed the experience but my biggest compliant would be we were \"too taken care of\". Which is a thing. I felt rushed and we were checked on too often. Of course anyone should come here to experience it for themselves. This was just my experience."

    "review": "This is truly the most romantic restaurant i have ever seen. The articles are right. The most memorable meal I had in London - from the high level of service to the exquisite food to the jaw-dropping romantic atmosphere. If you are a couple in love, this should be at the top of your restaurant bucket list. If you are a solo or group foodie, then dine in their well appointed dining room surrounding the romantic conservatory so that you can enjoy this fine meal without the sappy lovers swapping gazes. \nI'll start with the food because it cannot be overstated how much attention was placed to every taste detail. Even the salad left you wondering - how do they do it? Salad shouldn't taste this good. Get the salad.\nI ordered the burrata with marinated beets - totally odd composition to me, but the chef pulled it off. As beautifully set as this dish was, the taste was better. Flawless. Get this one too.\nFor my entree I ordered the line caught cod. Bonus points to CM for the line caught fish. The flavors were subtle and enjoyable.\nWe had to get on to our show, so no time for dessert, but I could have stayed in that restaurant for hours drinking the fine wines they had available. I was impressed with the sommelier who did not suggest the highest priced glass of wine. He chose the perfect pairing for my entree.\nNot only was the sommelier on point, every person from the hostess to the bread boy (?), the waiter to the manager was above and beyond knowledgeable and kind. Patient with my questions about the food and request for pictures, this team could not be thanked enough. I wanted to hug everyone there.\nDuring our meal this woman showed up dressed in cargo pants and flip flops asking for a table here. The manager was nicer than I would have been but politely told her that the conservatory (where the flowers hang) books 6 months in advance and she could not be accommodated. I mean, you can see walking in that this is a very nice place - and you want to be sat looking like you just came off the fishing pier? Whaaaa? Who does that? Have some respect for yourself and the people who are all in there dressed nicely for a formal meal and t he proprietors who are trying to create a romantic ambiance. The moral of this story is make reservations far in advance and dress appropriately.\nI am not a poet, as any words I could compose would fail to do justice to the flower heaven that has been created here, so look at my pics. I am lucky enough to have a very romantic boyfriend who takes me to many romantic restaurants, but Clos Maggiore is unique and will forever have top billing in my mind and heart as the most romantic restaurant. Save up and go here."

    "review": "Many publications name Clos Maggiore one of the most romantic restaurant in London, & rightfully so; however, sharing the experience of their fascinatingly beautiful conservatory with a friend or family member can be just as lovely. \nI made a reservation about 45 days in advance, & to be expected, only had my choice of time slots after 9pm. I chose 9:30pm which had the disadvantage of being too late to order the 5-course tasting menu (\u00a365; might've been a blessing in disguise because I couldn't fathom eating another bite after just three courses), but also the benefit of getting a table in the much-coveted conservatory, which is draped in white cherry blossoms. I imagine the chances of being seated here during prime dining hours are nearly impossible, as there are only about 6-7 tables in the area. The cozy armchairs, warmth of the fireplace, & scenery that can be described as a page out of Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" is an experience that we'll look back on fondly. \nWhile the ambiance is unbeatable, the food is nice, but not phenomenal. With each course, my satisfaction with the taste of the dish dwindled. I started with Crispy Polenta & Saint Marcellin Cheese, which has an interesting mix of toppings: grilled young broccoli, pickled pears, almonds, & salsa verde. The vegetarian main I chose was heavy & became quickly tiresome: papardelle with grated fresh truffle, mushrooms, parmesan, & truffle sauce. Dessert was a Baked Natural Greek Yogurt Cheesecake with citrus accompaniments, which lacked creaminess & instead had the consistency of a panna cotta. If I could re-do the meal, I'd choose a different main & dessert. \nThe reason for my middle-of-road rating has to do with service. Our waiter was not engaging & disinterested, which made us feel ill-at-ease. Though we saw him walking around, he didn't stop to check on us. We ordered our desserts with a different wait staff member & my requests of no citrus was completely lost. Another miss was interrupting us several bites into our main to add an ingredient to our respective dishes (sauce for my dining partner's pork tenderloin, shaved truffles for my pasta.) I'm perplexed as to why this wasn't done within seconds of bringing out our plates, which seems the customary practice when a dish requires finishing touches. \nNo one can deny the uniqueness or exquisiteness of the room for which Clos Maggiore is known. Their attention to customers (or rather, lack thereof) & unspectacular dishes -- well, those are subjects that are wide open for debate (& hopefully, improvement.)"

Named, \"The most romantic restaurant in the world.\" And by all means this post is not meant in any way to boast but rather to suggest to you if you or know of someone that is a huge foodie or and looking for a beautiful experience in dining while in London please share this place on. My husband and I love trying different cuisines and wines when we can. So I truly would love to take a moment to share with you of this beautiful gem off Covent Garden in London. From the moment we walked in, the amazing food, impressive 2,500+ in international wine selection, and impeccable service are just few to describe of the wonderful experience we had when we were there. There is a 6-7 month wait list for reservations but is well worth it, so book ahead. A romantic and small French cafe from the outside leads you in to a warm greeting as they'll help you to your area of seating request. From that moment we were lost in words entering the most beautiful conservatory elegantly adorned with cherry blossoms above. We then met our waiter Hugo.Attentive, wonderful and just made sure we really enjoyed ourselves. He helped answered all of our questions, made sure if we had any food allergies, and thoroughly explained what each dish was and how it was prepared. We then tried the seasonal tasting menu which consisted of 5 dishes starting with: Handpicked dorset crab mayonnaise with green apple & mango salsa, followed by the most delicious Pan-roasted Les Landes Duck Foie Gras with Fig and Oat biscuit, Pan-roasted and smoked wild sea bass with smoked haddock and leek croquette, oven-roasted and herb smoked \u00cdberiko pork loin with chorizo and sweet peppers. Every dish was decadent, flavorful and truly unique on its own but complimented the dish right before it perfectly. At this point-of-time I thought I had reached my limit on tummy capacity. I mean, how could I even possibly take another bite? But it's dessert! there's always room for dessert!We finished it off with Blackcurrant sorbet paired with champagne foam. Mind blown. Please be sure to give them a visit when you're in town, you truly won't regret it."

    "review": "I came here for the beautiful dining room, left was thoroughly impressed by the whole dining experience. The conservatory here is known as one of the most beautiful and romantic dining rooms in London, with delicate flowers and lights strewn in a canopy below a skylight, a nice fireplace, and a number of very well placed mirrors to make the place look much bigger than it is. I was surprised to find that there are only 7 tables in the room, which explains why you have to book 6 months in advance! Most tables were occupied by parties of 2 (lots of couples), but two in the corners were larger and seated groups of 3 or 4. There is an awkward table in the middle that ends up being watched by the groups of two, so try to avoid that one if you can! We saw a couple sit there and then were re-seated just a few minutes later (presumably they asked to be moved). We ordered from the rather affordable seasonal set menu (5 courses for \u00a365) and opted for the wine pairing, which is \u00a340 per person. The food was excellent and the wine pairing phenomenal, with unique wines like whites from Santa Barbara and a red dessert wine. They even accepted my substitution request without question when I wanted a dish from the vegetarian set menu instead of one of ones from the main set menu. Service was very quick and we didn't have to wait long for any dish, and the sommelier always just behind, ready with an explanation of why the wine was chosen for the pairing. In all, we finished 5 courses in less than 2 hours (that's my kind of fine dining!) I would recommend this for couples or special occasions, it's just such an incredible place and one of those quintessential London classics. But book ahead for the conservatory! Definitely worth the wait!"

    "review": "We had to come back here for a 2nd time during our vacation in London. For the 1st time, I made reservations about 3 weeks early for our anniversary. I was hoping to sit in the Conservatory, but when I asked about it when we came in they said they were booked until December! That's 3 months!\nSo we were seated upstairs in an intimate room & had the seasonal tasting menu with wine pairing. I choose the vegetarian tasting menu & who knew vegetables could taste so good!! It really showed that the simplest dishes could still taste amazing & didn't need to sacrifice flavor! \nFOOD & DRINK HIGHLIGHTS\n-Chargrilled Green Asparagus: Really asparagus? This was the best asparagus I've ever had.  I didn't expect too much from it by just looking at it, but it was SO DELICIOUS! My husband doesn't like asparagus & he thought it was amazing too. \n-Papardella with Truffle & Mushrooms: This dish was so decadent. Instead of adding freshly grated parmesan on top, they put freshly grated truffle on top! What?! & they add a good layer on top.\n-Iced Green Apple Parfait: Wow. This was the perfect fall dessert. \n-Shetland Isles Mussel & Saffron Soup: I was obsessed with the mussels in London & I love saffron so I thought this was going to be really good & it was! \nEverything we had was amazing & the wine pairing was PERFECT! I discovered a new favorite wine of mine, Foradori Fontanasanta Nosiola. \nCONSERVATORY vs SITTING UPSTAIRS\nFirst time when we were seated upstairs, it felt more intimate & service was very attentive. The team worked well with one another & everything flowed. There was never a time our water wasn't filled & they were ready for our next course when we were. It gave us a better chance to enjoy the food & the entire experience. The 2nd time we asked a couple days early if we could make a reservation & a reservation was just cancelled. We were so lucky that we got the middle table in the Conservatory! In the Conservatory, the team seemed a little more flustered possibly because the Conservatory & downstairs area is larger. The Conservatory was really beautiful & romantic!! Both experiences/rooms felt different, but we enjoyed Clos Maggiore very much. If only this place wasn't thousands of miles away from home!"

Oh so very very well.\nI had got the Conservatory room, the one its most famous for. However I wouldn't have minded either way. The other parts of the restaurant seep charm and grace. The food and service is second to none and never have I felt so special and cared for. I saw other reviewers saying they never got the conservatory and frankly, was it because I booked ahead? was it because we ate at 7pm when it was quieter, or was I lucky? Not sure. We were a couple and it was almost as if that room never had a table bigger than 2-4 anyway. Mostly it sat couples.\nThe food is to die for, im getting hungry again just thinking about it. I was tempted for the taster menu but we felt we would both have a starter, a main and a shared desert with coffee & Petit fours. \nCertainly it was pricey but it was a special anniversary meal that was worth paying for. Thoroughly recommend the place and want to go back asap!"

Made up to look like a French courtyard it has twinkling fairy lights and faux apple blossom. So pretty - somehow they managed to avoid tackiness. Summer is the best when the skylight is open.\nAnyway, the food. It is really good - I'll admit not the best French/Mediterranean in London but let's face it, you're mainly here for the ambience. I highly recommend the pasta - I rarely eat pasta out but Clos Maggiore's really is superb. As is the confit duck. \nService is fantastic. Friendly and attentive but not intrusive.\nOh and if you're a wine lover - they have a ONE HUNDRED PAGE wine list with over 2,500 wines!"

    "review": "We booked a lunch reservation here 3 months before heading to London for our honeymoon, as there were no dinner reservations available. We were so excited about dining here. It was to be a highlight of our stay. We received a call and voicemail from the restaurant a week before our reservation and upon calling them back, I spoke with one of the rudest woman I have ever had the displeasure of speaking with. When I tried to get clarification on our reservation (I didn't realize there were two sections of the restaurant and was advised this via their voicemail) the woman on the other line was clearly annoyed that she had to explain this to me. After she explained there were two sections and we wouldn't be eating in the conservatory (the beautiful section you see in all their photos) she proceeded to tell me that in order to be seated in the conservatory, we would have needed to book our LUNCH reservation a YEAR IN ADVANCE. I have to put this is caps because it blows my mind that they wouldn't have this listed anywhere on their site. A kind \"FYI, most people who are seated in our conservatory book a year in advance\" or something of this nature would have been nice. Still, this wasn't an absolute no-go for us. What sealed the deal was the next thing she said... \"So, are you going to confirm your reservation or not?\" We were given no time to process what she had just said before that! Needless to say, we prefer not to have our food with a side of nasty attitude. Not only did she phrase everything as if to make it clear she thought the conversation wasn't worth her words, as soon as I said we wouldn't be confirming, she immediately hung up the phone. No \"Goodbye\", no \"Sorry to hear\", etc. We wouldn't have gone after that conversation had they paid for the meal and put us in the conservatory.  I can't believe people are still patronizing this place with a woman like her being the first impression everyone gets of their restaurant."

(since the name of this restaurant is half French half Italian, I'd have to express my feelings for it the same way).\nIt apparently has the reputation of being one of the most romantic restaurants in London, and indeed it is! If you are lucky enough to get seated in the conservatory area, you'd find yourself in a midsummer night's dream kind of surrounding. \nI went with a group of 5 and we were seated outside of the conservatory, but that's okay, we are just a bunch of foodies looking for our next favourite dinner spot. It was still a very classy setup: leather couch, white table cloths, sparkling silverware and very polite (and funny) waiters. \nWe ordered the tasting menu. The foie gras appetizer was amazing, and I loved the asian flavoured glazed duck . The peanut butter parfait was interesting, for me it was delicious, but I can see how some people wouldn't like it if they don't like peanut butter. \nOur waiters and sommelier were all super helpful, and fun to chat with. \nIn general I enjoyed dining here very much and would definitely return here. Hopefully I can book a table within the indoor garden next time!"

    "review": "Lovely romantic anniversary dinner paired with delicious wine by a fantastic sommelier, let down by the fact we weren't placed in the conservatory as promised.\nMyself and partner ate here for our anniversary dinner in October, after I made reservations months in advance. We were welcomed into a beautiful restaurant with impeccably dressed staff, and seated just outside the conservatory; a beautiful intimate light studded garden scene. This is my only negative, and I'd asked and been promised to be seated in this area- so I seated faced away so she could look at it in bliss and I could stare at the well stocked bar.\nFood was great- we ate the Pumpkin & Pine nut soup and the Braised Shoulder of Loire Valley Rabbit, Sweet & Sour Black Radish & Wholegrain Mustard Mousseline for starters. Delicious, really truly delicious. Even the bread basket was utterly morish, especially the rosemary focaccia. We asked for more, happily given.\nMains were the Oven Roasted Venison Fillet, season autumnal vegetables, truffle & potato mash, with a slow cooked beef & potato gratin side; and Slow Cooked Fillet of Scottish Cod 'Rougaille' Roasted Vermicelli, Mussel & Iberico Chorizo Fideu\u00e0. Venison was perfectly cooked, as was the cod. Felt the cod dish didn't hugely work together, but might be my personal feeling- didn't leave me with a 'wow' feeling unlike the rest of the food. \nWine- The sommelier was extremely helpful and paired us two different wine wines for starters, and another white (for her) and deep red for my venison. I've completely lost my notes on what they were, but will update when I read their extensive wine list.\nWe were so full we skipped on dessert barring a decent but not special coffee. Which was fine as they brought out a plate with 'Happy Anniversary' written in chocolate and some cake. Nice touch and I had forgotten I'd told them!\nLeaving I had a great talk with the front of house about their wine cellar whom nearly brought me down for a look but construction was going on. Next time!\nOverall- 100% recommended. Expensive yes, coming in around \u00a3120, but once utterly worth it. Get into the conservatory however! It's magical."

    "review": "Had the potential to be the best meal of our trip to London based on food alone, but the service was perhaps the worst I've experienced in my adult life.  \nThe Aubergine appetizer, pork loin and truffle pappardelle were all delicious (though salad was way over seasoned even for a salt-lover), if the service were even moderately normal, I'd probably give 4 or 5 stars (or more likely, not bother reviewing since they are already so positively reviewed)\nThe server who initially took our order never returned to our table and we had 4 or 5 other waitstaff cycle through the meal, never asking how things were.  The wine I ordered was poured from the very end of the bottle, there was no offer of a tasting before the \"full\" pour, which looked quite short still when the bottle was emptied, but no top-off was offered from a fresh bottle.  Once we finished our first drink, glasses were removed from our table and we were never offered a second drink.  \nThe food was delicious, but difficult to enjoy given how hot it was in the restaurant. Once we were done with our mains, all we wanted to do was pay our check and get out into the cool air outside.  Unfortunately, we wound up sitting with our plates in front of us for an additional 20 minutes before they were cleared and a dessert menu shoved in front of us wordlessly, with the server abruptly departing before we could say \"check please!\"  Another 20 minutes before a new waiter came over to ask if we'd like dessert, to which we finally replied \"no thank you, check please\". He then awkwardly asked if we were celebrating anything, and I quietly replied that we were on our honeymoon.  That was apparently a mistake, as he disappeared again only to emerge 15 minutes later with a giant \"congratulations\" plate arranged with a few small petit fours, a sweet gesture (though worth noting every table received the same treats at the end of their meals), but it took another 20 minutes after that before we were able to successfully wave down the manager for our check.\nWe encountered a few other services issues (including the manager arguing with kitchen staff), but I feel like I've already ventured too far into petty-town, you get the picture. \ntl;dr :  food = very good, wait staff needs management overhaul and proper training"

After I told him that I just want to take some photos from here, this guy used loud and serious voice said :' other customers do not want to see people staying here( the conservatory), and do you understand what I mean?'  Well, i never seen a waiter being so rude and unfriendly to their customers from the Michelin star restaurant.

    "review": "After a lukewarm review in the last fortnight by Grace Dent, I was reconsidering the wisdom of my choice to bring my wife here for our 4th anniversary.\nI'm glad I stayed the course.\nIn terms of location - we did end up in one of those slightly sub-optimal places outside of the main atrium, but you know what? I didn't mind. Even the relatively pokey table we got (booking only 2 weeks in advance is apparently a rookie error) was actually fine. Would it've been nicer to be in the conservatory? By the looks of it yes, but the ambience was perfectly adequate. Granted, the whole \"most romantic restaurant in London\" vibe was missing, but it was still completely fit for purpose for a nice evening meal with a loved one.\nService throughout was absolutely spot on; from the girl who greeted us and took our coats, through to the sommelier and the food runners, all of the staff were attentive, jovial, and professional. As a restaurateur, my biggest pet peeve is bad service, but these guys didn't put a foot wrong. Nothing was too much trouble, and they balanced well the needs for discretion and engaging service. \nBreads looked superb in totality, though I never moved beyond their frankly sublime cheese focaccia. My opening piece which seemed to boast a schmear of ricotta in the centre was indisputably one of the finest breads I've had. 2 Further pieces lacked the same slightly sharp bite of cheese filling, but remained gloriously soft and flavourful.\nFood was consistently good. Crab with smoked anchovy and cauliflower brought together 2 of my least favourite things into a very surprising dish. Paired with a wonderful Alsatian Riesling, it promised that the rest might well blow my concerns out of the water.\nFoie Gras next, with roasted quince and gingerbread. Wonderful. A light touch from the kitchen, evocative of something I couldn't quite put my finger on, but it conjured up very warm feelings. Great little confit duck croquette. Served alongside a stunning Fiano orange wine, this was a great next step.\nCod with vermicelli and chorizo was one of the less exciting dishes. Beautifully cooked fish, with a lightly spiced pasta (they described it as more like a paella, which sort of makes sense in terms of the serve) was very pleasant, if not as demanding of oohing and aahing as other courses. \nGorgeous duck with roasted plum and endive to follow. Slightly overcooked against the medium-rare that they recommended, but on the rarer side of medium, so hardly a travesty. My virtual thermometer may be off, but I know the Chef that night was French, so am surprised he erred towards better done. A stunning 2001 'Corullon' from Spain quickly smoothed over any slight wrinkles.\nA last minute request for the cheese course was graciously obliged, and I'm incredibly pleased that it was so. A wonderful cross section, including Lancashire Bomb and Bleu St Jacques was superb, along with a cheeky Madeira. Biscuits are supposedly \"hand baked\", though they looked bought in. Very nice all the same.\nWe closed on a peanut butter parfait with a black sesame sponge which was a very interesting juxtaposition of flavours and textures. Not seen anyone convert black sesame into the almost seaweed-like sponge that accompanied this. The accompanying 2007 Jurancon was bang on the money - by far one of the better ones I've tried.\nPetits Fours, coffee and Calvados, along with some complimentary eaux de vies, provided a very welcome rounding off.\nAll in all a very worthy location for a dinner, regardless of which table you get. I will certainly be popping back in (maybe even just for an impromptu course or two with a glass of wine, but can happily recommend it for any and all occasions. Fellow diners appeared to comprise birthdays, large groups, and informal post-dinner crowds, so the clientele is an interesting mix, though it seems like a degree of pre-planning is required to have any certainty of a table."

No one balked at our attire. Instead, the politely took our coats and seated us in a cozy room with a fireplace that was much welcomed by us after a day in the rain.\nWe both ordered the tasting menu and I had the paired wines. Before each course was presented, the wine steward presented the bottle at the table and explained a bit about the wine as well as their reasons for choosing it to compliment the dish.\nThe scallops were perfectly cooked-- deliciously seared on the outside. Foie gras with pear and this crispy little semi sweet cookie was out of this world and paired with a Gewurtztraminer from Washington. Lamb chops were succulent and they brought an amazing cheese course with four fabulous cheeses, crackers and quince jam. Dessert was a molten chocolate cake... so gooey and delicious, served with a Sauterne!? It was heavenly!\nService was a little stiff but wonderfully efficient and informative.\nThe tasting menu was great value, I won't confess to know what the bill was since my boyfriend paid-- I know it wasn't cheap-- but the quality and presentation were outstanding. Coupled with the fabulously cozy and romantic decor, it made for a wonderful evening.\nI would recommend this restaurant to couples--possibly small family gatherings.

I also thought they seemed a bit unreasonably annoyed with us as two of our party were very late. However I think they did warm up to us, or perhaps we just warmed to them.\nOur party was too large to sit there, however smaller groups of four of less can sit in the light and very pretty 'garden' area underneath pink (and surely artificial) blossoms.\nThe a la carte is not available on weekends. There's a three course set menu only, which actually makes financial sense given that it includes half a bottle of wine.  On the set there were only a limited number of dishes I could order due to my fussy diet - there were many dishes that seems ok on the surface and then on closer inspection were stuffed with shellfish and pork (things I do not eat). I ordered a very delicious gazpacho soup, followed by an intense and tasty duck and a very interesting nougat glace for dessert.\nI came out of lunch clutching my stomach for over consumption of so much rich food over three courses (not including the really yummy foccacia at the start!). Overall it was good and I did enjoy it, but the restaurant was just a bit too traditional in attitude for my liking. \nIt was also a bit of a shock to find out they actually charged on the bill for the seemingly complementary petit fours served at the end. We were so full at the time, we could have very easily skipped them. Very cheeky and underhand Clos Maggiore, very cheeky of you indeed."

The wine list literally goes on for days.\nReally nice atmosphere and impeccable service. Well worth the money!"

    "review": "I wanted to treat my family to a nice meal on our vacation in London while still trying to maintain a budget since the exchange rate is horrible against the dollar.\nI read in a few traveler guides that the \u00a319.50 3 course pre fixe was a good value at Clos Maggiore. I suppose considering the cost of most meals in London we did get a decent value but was expecting more from this restaurant.\nThe conservatory room is gorgeous and intimate. Since it was a clear day they opened the retractable glass roof which brought in a nice fresh breeze. Only issue with that was little black seeds, that looked like rat droppings, kept falling from above onto diners.\nOur head waiter was a strange. He had to go over our orders multiple times and had to look over the menu more than once after I gave my order. I think a restaurant of this quality should have waitstaff that are familiar with the menu. At one point he chased me down on my way to the bathroom to clarify one more time what my starter was even though 3 of us ordered the same thing!\nThe food was just average and the options were rather limiting. I ordered the pork terrine and thought it was good but my sister likened it to fancy spam. My hubby ordered the crab mousseline for his starter which had an supplemental fee of \u00a35 and not worth it. Bisque was more like a foam and the portions of scallops were small.\nFor entrees, I had the guinea fowl and everyone else ordered the red mullet w/smoked haddock risotto. I found the smoked fish flavour very overpowering. The mushrooms on my dish were tasty albeit on the salty side. I've never had guinea fowl but it tasted like old chicken and not very tender.\nmy mom's favorite part of the meal was the plum tart dessert. \nI don't think my family was too impressed with the meal."

We didn't get to experience the outdoor area which looks like a fairy tale in pictures I've seen but it was most certainly romantic indoors! The low lighting, wood, reds and greens make for a beautiful decor and the menus are indulgent enough for any special occasion. It's quite hard to book a table but we ended up walking in spontaneously on a Wednesday night around 8pm and had no issue sitting straight down. We took the seasonal tasting menu which is reasonably priced at \u00a355/pers (without wine). The five course meal was delicious, portions are not very big but by the time we'd finished we certainly weren't hungry. The food is rich, flavours very well brought together and produce of great quality. There's no particular risk taken on the food associations - foie gras/duck and fruit, fish and chorizo... But sometimes traditional is just right, especially when you are out for a classy date. If you're not a pudding person please don't skip this one - it was the culinary highlight of the meal. Loved it, looking forward to going back. Would probably try a la carte next time or go back when new season kicks in on the tasting page. Or maybe even try the veggie tasting menu..."

I wear some punk rock looking sweatshirt or t-shirt with jeans and trainers and he's in a really expensive suit.  Doesn't mean we don't have a common love of good food.  I often wonder what people think when they see us together, especially when we turn up in nice restaurants.  \nToday we went to Clos Maggiore for lunch and arrived without a reservation literally at the end of lunch service.  They seated us anyway and even took my jacket and hung it up, nice.  \nI have a new love for lunch prix fixe menus.  I'm sure dinner is off the charts expensive at this place, but for lunch they had an amazing prix fixe menu!  3 courses or 2 courses and a 1/2 bottle of wine for 19 pounds.  Killer!!!!  \nI don't think I've ever had such good service without the waiters barely saying a word.  The place looks like a place where high end business happens, a really unique interior.  \nWe both ordered off the prix fixe and it was DELICIOUS!  Whenever we go out to eat my boyfriend always asks if I'd like some of his food.  I've come to learn that by saying that, what he really means is \"can I have some of yours?\"  Now that I've deciphered the code we always discuss what we're ordering before hand so we'll both be happy to \"share\".  \nStarters:\nSeared Tuna - This was delicious, it came with a pastry, almost baklava type pairing, and a wonderful sweet bruschetta.  Sweet cheeks literally cut the starter in half so we could switch once we'd eaten our allotted halves.  \nPea and Mint Soup - Wonderfully rich and creamy, yet light at the same time, and had broad beans as well.  Came with some addictive cheese bread on the side.  Bring on Round 2!  \nMains:  \nSlow cooked beef cheek - I can't say I've ever had \"beef cheek\" but it was delicious.  Very tender and the meat effortless pulled apart.  Was accompanied with a very rich sauce and green pea pods with carrots. I will now add \"beef cheek\" to dishes I want to try at home!\nMonkfish - I've never been a huge fan of fish, but this was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The outside was nice and  crispy and soft on the inside.  It came with prawns as well.  Both mains were delicious.  \nI had the 3 course and got the coffee and petite fours for dessert.  They were 6 scrumptious little samples of YUM!  I said that anything that is gold dusted will most certainly be delicious and I was right!  \nI love deals, I love good food, I love good service, I love ambiance.  All of which I got at Clos Maggiore for lunch!  Party!"

    "review": "This is possibly one of my favourite restaurants in London. Nestled only a short walk away from bustling Covent Garden is this extremely cute little place.\nWhat is most striking is its interior. It is in a Georgian townhouse, and as soon as you enter you just feel like you're in a different world. Their website describes it as a 'romantic remembrance of stylish country inns in Provence and Tuscany', and they couldn't be more right. \nI have always dined in the conservatory of the downstairs dining area, with only around 7 tables, the space is very small, however you don't feel cramped at all. The ceiling is high, topped with a glass roof, allowing lots of natural light, and accentuated with the soft yellow glow of side lamps dotted around the room. Cherry blossom flowers are weaved around the walls, and at the end of the room is a fire place, it is simply the epitome of cosy and intimate. \nUnlike many high-end restaurants, the food comes in decent portions, and is well presented in a very creative manner. The menu is warm and filling from just reading through it, with a fusion of French flavours, and the ingredients are always fresh and  according to season. The dishes are hearty and sumptuous with such things as 'roasted fillet of 'Duke of Westminster' venison with prune and turnip gratin and bitter chocolate sauce', or 'treacle caramelised breast of Gressingham duck with poached figs, ruby port sauce.' \nThe desserts are always perplexing to me as I can never seem to envision what exactly will be served from just looking at how it is described on the menu, but nevertheless, I am always impressed. \nThey have a 3 course lunch menu for just under 20 pounds, an extensive, award winning wine list, and the staff are friendly and extremely attentive, but they don't linger. \nAll in all, a very impressive place worth every penny for a visit!"

The accolades have as much to do with the restaurant's dreamily cherry blossom-filled conservatory as with the menu  which is gorgeous. As far as I can tell anyway: I've only been once and that was to sample their ultimate chocolate menu coinciding with Chocolate Week back in October (2010). The six course tasting menu was as intriguing as it is luxuriant - more a gourmet dining experience than merely a nice meal - and, when paired with their specially selected wines, yielded a delicious flight of flavour for contemplative foodies with sophisticated palates and a sheer delight for any palate otherwise.\n Service is exceptional, the location is convenient and the wine list rocks!\n I'm keen to return for a go at Clos Maggiore's regular menu. In fact, I've already made the rez."

After taking into account all the advice from Yelp and various other sites, I selected this Covent Garden French eatery. Supposedly the BEST French restaurant in all of London, I was told. Perhaps even the best restaurant of any cuisine in London.\nPuh-lease. This place isn't even the best restaurant on this STREET. \nI had booked weeks in advance and we got put in the cave of the upstairs private room. Those wanting to dine in the lovely conservatory be warned - specify on your reservation.\nTo their credit, my tomato salad was delicate and ripe. My dining companion's scallops were perfectly cooked. Our entrees, on the other hand, were mediocre at best. Nearly \"inedible\" tagiatelle and beef that was anything but gourmet. \nThe service was slow but our waitress was good natured, if not taken aback by the fact that we didn't come close to finishing our dishes.\nWe booked it out of there and luckily caught a window at our favorite restaurant for dessert.

The excellent meal ended with an amazing desert; Amalfi lemon & olive oil tiramisu (fresh Amalfi lemon & thyme sorbet).

The waitstaff is very well trained, they all welcome you by name, and the service is impeccable.\nMy wife and I went to Clos Maggiore to celebrate my birthday.  It's one of those small, intimiate, romantic settings - I certainly wouldn't bring kids here.  I'm a huge wine enthusiast - so I was thrilled when I saw the school textbook-sized wine menu.  I think it was 90+ pages.  The great part is that the wine list was organised by the sommelier's recommendations, then by grape, then by region.  Trust me - there is a bottle of wine for everyone here.  We were particularly pleased with the French wine selection.  Just having returned from Burgundy, we were able to find several of our favourites on the list.\nIn terms of the food, we decided to go with the tasting menu.  The first course was marinated scallops with charlotte potatoes and seaweed salad.  This was accompanied by a really nice Sauvignon Blanc from Tinpot Hut.  Our second course was a fantastically prepared pan fried duck foie gras and a crisp confit duck leg.  My wife really enjoyed the wine compliment - a riesling kabinett from Mosel, Germany.  For our third course, we had a very nicely prepared slow cooked fillet of Cornish cod.  It was served on a bed of butter beans and sauce rougaille.  This course was accompanied by my favourite wine of the evening:  Marsanne, Qup\u00e9 2008 Santa Barbara County, California.  A French couple owns this US-based vineyard and they make terrific wine.  It reminded me much of a nice white Burgundy from the Chassagne-Montrachet area.  For the fourth course, we had my favourite course of the night:  treacle caramelised breast of Gressingham duck.  This was served with roasted red plums, endive meuniere, and a ruby port sauce.  The accompanying wine was also very well paired - a Barolo from the Marchesi di Barolo producer in Piemonte, Italy.  Our fifth course was a fairly standard cheese plate.  To be honest, this was my only disappointment all night.  They did not bring a cheese trolley over to the table and pre-selected all of the cheeses.  Many of the cheeses were also stinky soft cheeses, which I am not entirely keen on.  Nonetheless, it was paired with a nicely\nwith walnut  and raisin rye flour bread biscuits and quince jelly.  The\nBarros Late Bottled Vintage Port from the Duoro Valley was also nice to cut through the cheese.  The sixth and final course was a Valrhona chocolate and griottine fondant served with cherry sorbet.  I probably could have eaten this for all six courses.  It was paired wonderfully with a reserve muscat from Yalumba NV Victoria, Australia.  This was a nice ending to a wonderful meal.  They even spelled \"Happy Birthday\" on the plate for our special occassion.\nDon't miss a chance to eat at Clos Maggiore.  Leave plenty of time to enjoy your meal and use if for a special occassion!\nTIP:  Book in advance.  This restaurant is fairly small and cannot accommodate a large number of people.  Use Open Table to secure your booking in advance.  Also, check with the host to see if you can be seated in the centre of the restaurant near the fireplace.  Very romantic!"

I have never seen a bigger drop off from back of house to front, but that is just what we got. Even though we booked at least one month out, we were seated at the first table in the bar. We asked about being seated elsewhere, and were told that we had not requested the dining room and this would be our table. Next time I guess I'll inform them of my desire to eat when placing my dinner reservation. This set the tone for the pretentious service we would have all night. The large table next to us was halfway through the meal and the staff still managed to spill three times on them. I think the only \"apology\" one poor guy who had coffee spilled all over his suit received was a napkin. Staff was not too helpful with selections and every interaction was curt, if even a word said. We heard tables ask about the need for side dishes.  The staff did not really respond, instead they just placed an order for more food. The entrees are huge and the sides largely untouched. \nThankfully, that moves us on to the food which was fantastic. We started with grilled scallops served on mashed potatoes. \nEntrees were a dry aged Scottish ribeye, gratin potatoes and haricot verts. It was served a bit undercooked when the knife finally arrived for me. It was a large cut and a sizable portion compared to many taster sizes at similar restaurants. \nWe finished with a very tasty lemon meringue before waiting a long time on our bill. A fitting conclusion to two ends of the spectrum between very high quality food and terrible service."

Also, conservatory is lovely (and romantic), but if you sit near the fire place you get a cold blast of air. Overall, enjoyed another great meal at Clos Maggiore and we will be visiting again soon."

Good intimate d\u00e9cor (especially if you like foliage), amazing wine list and very good food. Fantastic rabbit starter; very good meats. Pleasant service but could be more attentive. \nIdeal to impress the in-laws or for a romantic dinner."

    "review": "If you're in London with a niece and looking for somewhere to mutter sweet nothings into each others ear, then Clos Maggiore is the place for you.\n Packed to the rafters prior to theatre, once the luvvies have disappeared, the place really comes into it's own. The lighting is subtle, the conservatory - if you can get a table there - is delightful and the service matches the sublime elegance of the food to a tee.\n The wine list can appear as a bit of a shocker but, put your pretensions in your back pocket and even the cheapest wines on the extensive menu are wonderful.\n Pretty much all the dishes appear to be a smidge heavy on the truffles which, whilst delightful, can leave you feeling that you won't be needing a kebab on the way home.\n The pace is unhurried and friendly, and the waiters more than willing to make sensible suggestions for both food and wine.\n A really lovely and relaxing way to wind down after a day in town."

You do take a hit on the wine, so it's worth coming here prepared to spend quite a bit of money but well worth it once you do.\n This place has a lovely cosy and relaxed atmosphere to it - especially if, like us, you are lucky to be seated at one of the booths. The food is scrum and the service was attentive without being overbearing. We were supposed to vacate our table by a specified time but the staff were v. relaxed and allowed us to leave in our own (reasonable) time."

    "review": "Monsieur and I went to Clos Maggiore for his birthday earlier this year. It had been recommended by a friend and was number one in several categories on a restaurant website, so we gave it a whirl. The evening was an absolute dream. The waiters were warm, professional, courteous and efficient without being 'in your face'. The ambience was comfortable; an interesting blend of traditional and modern. The food, however, was what we were there for and was nothing less than divine. The scallops were seared to perfection, a pure taste of the sea, and the black-legged chicken with spaetzle and snails was unusual and so packed with taste-bud twists that my eating automatically slowed down to allow the chance to properly savour each mouthful. \nPrior to arrival, I'd e-mailed the General Manager of Clos Maggiore to warn them that we were celebrating a birthday. Completely discreet, the waiters didn't let on that this fact had been passed on until the very end of the meal, when Monsieur's dessert was presented with a lit candle and Happy Birthday written in chocolate sauce around the rim of the plate. \nSince then, we've been back once and experienced another perfect meal. We've also booked ahead for two family occasions over summer. Take it as read that this place is definitely worth the splurge. Keep an eye out for their deals, too, which are so good that you almost feel as if you're robbing the restaurateur."

    "review": "I took my wife to Close Maggiore on Saturday for her birthday. The restaurant really is a gem and perfect for special occasions. Sitting in the conservatory is a must, as you will regret it if you don't.\n The staff performed very well and the food was delicious. The wine list is outstanding and runs some 85 pages. The downside of that is that many of the bottles in a more affordable price range are sold out. While they do have some fantastic bottles, they run around \u00a3200. There wasn't much selection in the mid-range so the choices jumped from \u00a350 to around \u00a3150-200. Still, they have to be commended for a great wine selection.\n The only thing that marred our experience and prevents me from giving them a full 5 stars, is that while we had an 8pm reservation, we didn't get seated until 8.30 and had to wait in the very small lobby. While the staff was friendly and kept us informed, I still expected to have a table when I reserved.\n While the food was delicious and everything did seem reasonably priced for the experience, my starter of wild scallops was a disappointment. Three scallops for \u00a315 is pushing things a bit in my opinion.\n I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone for a special occasion or just a romantic dinner out."

Relaxed and intimate, with excellent food and a truly intimidating wine list, it is an excellent special occasion restaurant for couples or small parties alike. The decor is great: we were downstairs at the back under an impressive canopy of twigs in spring blossom (not real, but the effect is excellent) and the whole effect is subtle lighting and discrete charm. Good aircon too which was essential on the balmy July evening that we visited. The food was superb with the meat dishes particularly impressive. Service is friendly, efficient and non-invasive and winos can spend hours working through the encyclopedic wine list. This isn't a cheap restaurant, but it is not outrageously priced either - the problem is that with the relaxed atmosphere it is very easy to get pulled towards all the little extras that produce a bill larger than you might have wished! It is hard to regret it though as Clos is a really satisfying place to spend an evening. Highly recommended."

I haven't had dim sum in a very long time and my fianc\u00e9e was up for it so we popped in.  \nWe were greeted immediately and sat promptly, there wasn't much of a wait time until our server approached us and explained the menu and took our drink order.  Drinks arrived and we ordered shortly after.  It was no more than 3 minutes that passed that the food began arriving.  It amazed me to see that many people I the restaurant receiving their food so quickly.  \nWe ordered 6 dishes.  Pork puffs which were packed with flavor yet light.  Prawn crackers which had a nice tangy chili dipping sauce along with it. Crispy prawn balls which had a nice crunch and another great sauce paired with it.  Next up was the firecracker chicken roll which packed some awesome heat, not too much but just right for our palates.  Traditional xiaolongbao was next and there were delicious; seasoned just right and I wish I ordered a second order.  Lastly we had one of the specials which was Crispy duck bao... oh my word!!!  This was the absolute best!  The buns were soft and fluffy, the duck had a nice crunch to the skin and seasoned perfectly and the plum sauce accentuated everything just right.\nThe service was exceptional and the food was amazing.  This is a must try for any dim sum fan or someone who wants to give some delicious food a go.  Cheers!!!"

I found most of their dimsums acceptable but not the most flavourful. For instance, the soup within xiaolongbao should have been served much warmer, succulent and tasteful. Nonetheless, most everything got the job done, so I would give the place three stars. \nService was generally good. Whilst there was a slight glitch with our reservation, they were prompt in finding us a table for six. Throughout the meal, they served most everything on time. However, the bill they calculated turned out to be wrong on many items, so we had to manually check them and get them to correct for us. \nAmbience was modern and spacious.

The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because many of the items on their menu they didn't actually have.  One of the items they show off on their side walk board out front of their entrance, they only serve for lunch. So we were a little disappointed. But the food was amazing nonetheless. I'm glad we didn't walk out. We ordered 2 different chicken dumplings (chicken with cashews and spicy chicken with vegetables) and both of them were so fresh and flavorful. They were surprisingly out of vegetable rice so we opted for plain sticky rice and it was good and fresh. Their chicken skewers (3) were delicious and well portioned. Lastly, since their pan fried noodles advertised outside but only served for lunch were not available, we chose a vegetable dumpling and noodle soup and it was still hot when we got to the hotel and was packed full of goodies. We were very happy with everything we ordered and hope next time we can try the items they didn't have available. It was busy the entire time we waited for our order and every wait staff we encountered were very pleasant and kind. The place had a great vibe!"

I booked a table for 3 on a Weds eve and we were given one of the solo tables rather than being along the shared bar which was great as it's much easier to talk when facing each other!\nUnfortunately it all went a bit downhill from there as the service was inexcusably bad. We had around 45 minutes of happy hour left when we arrived so were pretty confident we could fit 2 drinks into that time, I ended up chasing the waitress down in order to get our second drinks ticket in on time. We also had to wait around 20 minutes for them to pick up our order sheet, despite the fact that we filled it in straight after ordering our first drinks. The biggest bug bear was after our food arrived my friend asked for a fork as she can't use chopsticks, and after at least a 10 minute wait sitting with our food going cold she had to go and ask a second waitress to be provided with one.\nI've given 3* rather than 2 as the food  and drinks were good and reasonable for the price we paid.

Although not your typical china town establishment, Ping Pong has obviously honed in on this little niche market and has done quite well in delivering food quality wise and has even produced dumplings which have been experimented on Heston style. We are talking art form here and everything in this restaurant is very classy, very modern, very artsy. One place you definitely need to pay a visit to are the toilets (not for that reason!!) which is situated down a dimly lit corridor (which is my excuse as I accidentally walked into a room with funny wall sinks...) and which are accessible by swiping a hand over a motion sensor panel. The decor is very upscale market and although the food is quite expensive individually, it does work out better value when opting for the set menus which offers several dishes and which does fill you up! In the event of you not being full, and wanting to try more or as much of the dishes as possible, then please do visit Sunday's special buffet, neatly labelled lazy sumdays ;-) for under a fixed price of \u00a325 you are treated to a wide range of dishes which you can easily get carried away with. \nIn terms of drinks, try the teas, as healthy as they are, it's also very fragrant and they come prepared with a 'tea bag' propped open with the tea contents shown."

None were bad and some were pretty good:\n--  Duck bao.  One of the more disappointing.  The duck was smoked and I prefer roasted while the sauce was somewhat thin.  It was a nice sized portion, though.\n--  Duck spring roll, good but not great.\n--  Prawn toast with sesame seeds, one of the best options.  Tasty, a lot of prawn, not much filler.\n--  Spinach and mushroom dumpling.  A surprise success, especially as I normally don't care of mushroom.  Very tasty, fried but not greasy.\n--  Honey soy chicken wings.  Looked and sounded good, meaty wings, not much flavour\n--  Char siu bun, a standard but well prepared and tasty, good balance of filling and bun\n--  Prawn and chive dumpling, good but not great\n--  Black prawn dumpling, most interesting and innovative dish, good flavor\n--  crab and prawn dumpling, good but not incredible\nI also didn't like the service.

There's a lot of natural light for an underground floor. \nThe wait staff are very polite and gave us a complimentary bottle of beer as it was a birthday in our group which was a nice touch. \nOn to the food...considering dumplings aren't really a speciality dish in their native country, Ping Pong manages to make the dish very appealing both to the eye and the palate. The selection is huge - seafood, chicken, beef, pork and lots more. Our favourite was the Shanghai Xiaolongbao. It's necessary to get the dipping sauces to add extra flavour to the dimsum. \nAnother top dish was the broccoli with the mustard dipping sauce. Then it's also worth trying the duck spring rolls with black sauce. \nThe portion size of the seaweed and prawn crackers was slightly small however they are of a higher quality than you'd typically find at a Soho Chinese restaurant so not too big a complain there. \nHuge recommendation whether a small family group or a large gathering of friends."

    "review": "I was invited out to lunch by a friend and we decided to go to Ping Pong; I had heard about them and she had already been. I love dim sum and wasn't too disappointed; it isn't the BEST in London, but it's tasty enough, the price is right and it's served on a decent environment with good atmosphere and sleek, modern decor (typical dim sum places can be noisy, too brightly lit, uncomfortable and that clich\u00e9 \"chinese takeaway joint\"  decor can put one off).\nYou are given a menu and a list where you tick your selected dishes - quite fun and makes ordering easy. Each portion comes with around three pieces and most are under \u00a34. The baskets come to the table all at once and will be stacked high if you order a lot; tables are on the small side, so it can become a bit awkward juggling all that stuff. But you'll manage. :) It is the right thing to do here, though; the portions aren't huge (they shouldn't be; it's dim sum after all) and it would be very time consuming to keep refilling your table everytime you finished a basket, increasing waiting times.  \nIf you're not too ravenous you could order two or three + a small main meal (one of the rice dishes, maybe). If you're really ravenous, well, you're going to spend a little more or go elsewhere. If you're going for the set menus they are good value, but remember you'll get mostly individual pieces instead of a portion of three as in the a la carte.\nAlmost everything I ordered was tasty, especially the honeyed chilli chicken and mushroom rice pot (not a big portion, but it's only over \u00a36 so I certainly wasn't expecting a bucket). The char sui buns (steamed bun with BBQ pork) are ok; I've certainly had better, but also much worse. Loved my drink called Hibiscus Spritz; you are given a glass of fizz with a flower inside an ice cube in which you pour a concoction of liqueurs; very \"chemistry class\" and deliciously refreshing. Didn't have time for more cocktails and dessert, but will do next time - the drinks menu look particularly appealing and I really liked the one I tried.\nApparently they are always changing the menus with the seasons. A good trick to get you coming back, and I intend to. :)"

Make sure that you book a table and maybe have plans for where to go afterwards. \nAs part of London restaurant month, they had a special dim sum set menu. Everything came out relatively quickly, but the portion that came out was a little small. It was also not the best dim sum I'd ever had, but I haven't had a good one in London yet.\nThis place was geared towards the foreign palate as opposed to real Chinese dim sum. Depends on what you're looking for."

I suppose I feel the same still but I was very pleasantly surprised at the value for money here! We were in the area and starving so we basically just picked the first place near us. We each got the set menu for 1 -- I got the vegetarian and my friend got the chicken I think. A rice bowl, 3 or 4 appetizers, and 4 dim sum for around \u00a312.50 if I remember correctly! We were both shocked at how much food we got and even though service was mediocre and my wine glass came out a little dirty.. I'm not mad about it. We had a good time and the seating at the bar looking down was pretty cool. Wouldn't be opposed to coming again if I was in the area! The food was satisfying, the wine was good, and my company was great :D"

Ping Pong offers this non - territorial atmosphere where you can order a lychee martini or mojitos and have it with your dim sum. It's a great hang out place for 3+ people so everyone can have a sharing + fun experience. It's a great place to take your non-chinese friends for their first dim sum experience. Fantastic!"

It's not the place!\nSpeaking about the food, the quality of it is really high: dim sum are great, with several different fillings and everyone with its characteristic taste and smell, delicious! strongly suggested the black ones (called black prawn dumplings), with squid ink pastry, and the chicken shu mai, chicken and asparagus in a top opened dumpling. But, just take some of them, portions are not that big (from 2 to 4 dumplings each) and it's just so good to share everything with your table!\nDon't forget to have a cocktail or something to drink, this place has a lot of different options you rarely see and their presentation is always special (as example, take the hybiscus spritz: awesome!)\nI still have to try the upper floor, with tables surrounding the kitchen, but I can't say anything bad about this place, this is just great! ah and it's not that expensive!"

    "review": "As restaurant chains go Ping Pong has to be one of the better ones.  I have been to a few of them over the years and they always serve delicious tasty food.\nPing Pong Soho is no different.  When I ate here recently it was full of people happily indulging in their favourite dim sum dishes and guzzling Ping Pong's fantastically exotic cocktails.\nThis is a particularly good venue for big groups and looking around this time I could see that most of the tables were filled with large groups of people.  The only small issue I had this time was my group of 16 were seated on two separate tables.\nThe food here is really delicious.  For those of you not familiar with the concept it is mainly Dim Sum, small bite sized portions of food which are traditionally served in small steamer baskets.  They can be steamed, fried or baked.  In addition to the dim sum they also serve a number of rice dishes such as Honey-Chilli \nChicken Rice Pot or Vegetable Sticky Fried Rice and some small plates such as Honey Glazed Spare Ribs and Chilli Squid.\nFor those of you a bit unsure of what to order there are set menus which will give you  a decent variety dishes to try and this is particularly good if you are ordering for groups.\nIf however you do fancy ordering for yourself then I can heartily recommend the aforementioned ribs, the Potato and Edamame Cakes, The Crispy Prawn Ball and to start the Garlic and Black Pepper Prawn Crackers.  Just don't go mad.  The food is a lot more filling than it looks and you can always order more later. \nThe big selling point for me though has to be the cocktails.  They put a big twist on your common or garden variety cocktail.  With names like Hong Kong Colada, Wasabi and Amaretto Sour and Smoked Nashi Negroni  they are sure to be a conversation starter and the best bit is they taste as good as they sound.  For those of you not so keen on alcohol they have  a good choice of mocktails and lemonades, and for those of you who want something simpler they have a good selection of beers, ciders and wines and a huge selection of teas.\nAnd the best bit of all is the bill at the end of the night will not break the bank!"

I would definitely recommend going on a Sunday when their lazy sumday offer is on: \u00a321.50 all you can eat (excluding a couple of areas of the menu). As ping pong is a dim sum restaurant, this offer definitely pays off, especially when in a group as you can all sample a large amount of dishes for far cheaper than you could ordinarily. \nThe cocktail (though excluded from the lazy sumday offer) are absolutely delicious as are the non alcoholic drinks. I would definitely recommend the Hong Kong Colada as well as the Passionfruit lemonade.\nAs far as food goes the dim sum is expertly made and really delicious. If you are unsure of what to order, go for anything in the Ping Pong selection but, as I said, I would recommend going on a sunday so you can experience many different types of dumpling. \nDefinitely recommend this spot for dinner/drinks in the city."

When I say much, I'm really referring to the dumplings, those steaming piles of slimy stuff delivered in towering stacks of bamboo baskets.  They're just not for me.  I really enjoyed everything else that we had, the edamame, duck rolls, honey chicken and rice.\nThe service was really efficient, although our waitress was either stoned or just extremely disengaged with the planet.  The beer was too expensive (\u00a36.95 for a 640ml bottle) although this seems to have become standard at most chain restaurants these days.  If you can get a seat at the bar I'd recommend it - it looked much more comfortable and spacious up there.\n4 stars overall - a chain place like this can never really get 5 stars so to get 4 is doing very well indeed."

All the classic dishes are on the menu - but with little twists, like using fragrant jasmine rice instead of glutinuous sticky rice, and prawn toast using french garlic baguette instead of normal toast.\n The menu is extensive and all the food, especially the seafood ones, were bursting with flavour and extremely fresh. You must try some of their more unusual dumplings - the seabass dumpling is a delight to the eyes, with a dunpling skin dyed purple using red cabbage juice.\n What sets Ping Pong apart from other dim sum restaurants in London is that its not a boring and stiff place - there's a lounge area, and their cocktail menu is quite extensive. You would go to Royal China for example if you had a business meal or a proper Sunday brunch with family. But you go to Ping Pong for a fun night out with friends.\n Pricewise, its more expensive than your usual dim sum in Chinatown, and probably the same price as other great dim sum places like Pearl Liang and Royal China.\n Reviewed by The London Insider\nlondon-insider.co.uk/201\u2026"

In fact, I often come here with a Chinese friend who agrees with all of the above.\nSo, what is it that I don't like? Well, it comes down to the interior design and the customer service, which this place is kind of lacking. Inter-design-wise, I am sure that lots of people would disagree with me, but for me this is too slick, too stylish and too wanna-be funky. As for the customer service, the people here seem to be lacking a great deal of motivation - no smile, no sign of personal acknowledgement whatsoever...and this just doesn't go well with me.\nPlus, it's also not a cheap meal, unless you come on a Sunday, when you can do Lazy Sum Day, which is an all-you-can-eat-kind-of-deal for GBP 18.99...still not cheap though.\nWhat this place is lacking is the authentic Chinese experience of push cards being rolled around in the restaurant, the steam baskets piling up in the trolleys and also the fact that you can order in a more leisurely style. Along the lines of: I still could eat one more, let's see what the next lady is having in her trolley...\nWell, if you want this experience in London, I suggest you go to New World in Chinatown..."

Most of the menu is available for this deal but the only trick is everyone in your party has to order this deal.

The choice of dishes extends enough to sate western palates and the ambiance is mass market chic\nThe 'service' is generally good but they do drop the 'ball' with the odd dish but I suppose this is because they're aiming to 'serve' a more mainstream market or for people who are new to dim sum. The best 'table' is probably at the counter where you can watch them steaming and preparing the dishes.\nA safe bet but not the most 'smash'ing for dim sum."

With 3 portions per appetiser, it is perfect for ordering a bunch and sharing. \nMy don't miss recommendations are the wonton soup, duck spring rolls, spicy chicken dumplings and fish and pepper gridled dumplings! Also great prices on wine by the glass and excellent cocktail; \nThe service and atmosphere at this location is spot on. Very friendly staff and a great vibe going on.

Thankfully, it didn't disappoint.\n Yummy little plates of dim sum, friendly service and great cocktails made for a successful evening. It's not cheap, so it's probably best to go for the set menu that Sarah mentioned below.\n If you're new to dim sum, I'd really recommend Ping Pong for serving something for all tastes.

I think I counted three other guys in there, everyone else seemed to be twenty or thirty-something groups of women (can't say that I was complaining!) \nI'm not a big fan of chains and prefer to support indie restaurants when possible, but sometimes when you're out with people you just want quick and easy 'safe' options. \nPing Pong is a very safe choice. Everything is fine at this branch. \nDrinks are ok. Good taste, but weak measures + too much ice) \nDim sum is ok, but a bit bland and pricy for what it is. \nService is good, lots of staff, typical of this sort of high-end mainstream type of restaurant (think Strada, Bertorelli etc.) \nSame goes for the surroundings, clean, well designed, with moody colours and lighting, but a bit soulless. \nAll in all, if you want a safe option, very close to Oxford Street tube, you could do a lot worse than Ping Pong. It's close to a 4 star rating, but expect to feel a bit rushed if they're very busy and they also don't accept American Express, which is pretty poor considering the number of restaurants in their chain + their enormous margins."

My friends all love Ping Pong, and suggest stopping by whenever we pass the ubiquitous Ping, but after a couple of visits there I am not so sure. So what is my issue?\nWell, perhaps I'm not sure how I feel about dim sum? I mean, it is a little odd. It comes steaming to the table, and then by the time you have got your chopsticks out, the dumplings have turned cold and gone strangely sticky. \nThe other thing is the cost. On paper it seems inexpensive. \u00a32.99 - \u00a33.99 for three dumplings. But here is the thing; the dumplings are swallowed in a flash, and they recommend ordering at least three portions, so it starts to slowly add up, then there are all the little sides, then the bill is bigger than expected, and I am still hungry!"

We're great fans of Yauatcha - Alan Yau's (creator of Wagamama) fantastic all day dim sum place and we'd heard that Ping Pong was just as good but cheaper.\n Well was it?\n Certainly on entering it looked great. We were taken downstairs and there were a number of huge round tables with a subdued light in the centre. We sat on one of the squarer tables but this had a great view of huge ornamental Japanese style courtyard, with trendy projections playing against and enormous wall.\n The food and cocktails were certainly cheaper than Yauatcha (not that Yauatcha's expensive) the cocktails were only six or seven pounds each, which was terrific value as they were very long, full of fresh fruit like kumquats, lychees, blueberries and grapes. Mine in particular had tons of fresh mint and was very alcoholic - so much so I managed to knock a third of it over - D'OH!\n We chose about ten dim sum dishes between the three of us and they averaged at about \u00a33 each. Ping Pong provided a handy menu that we could tick to keep track of our order and make it simpler to give our order to the waiter.\n Onto the food. If I hadn't already been to Yauatcha's several times, I would have thought the food was brilliant. It was certainly very, very good. Some dishes such as the chive dumplings stood out. The sticky rice in parcels was also tasty. The puffy buns were light and filling at the same time. The chilli sauce that was served with most dishes blew my head off - so handle with care.\n My friend had an amazing jasmine tea to finish - boiling water poured onto the head of jasmine flower. It looked like something out of Alien as it grew tendrils in the heat and eventually a white flower wound its way through the water looking like a sea anenome.\n Like all of the new dim sum places in London the toilets were highly trendy too. Black granite everywhere and sensitive taps which turn on as if by magic."

I arrived as part of a group of five, and we sat downstairs around a (too large) round table with benches.  It was a work-meeting at lunchtime, so non-alcoholic, and I had a delicious lemongrass-flavored iced tea. The waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, but the ordering and delivery of food was confusing, in part because it is all small dishes, and in a group it was difficult to figure out how much to order and sharing some of the dishes proved awkward.  Some of the deep fried stuff was great, but some of the others - meh.  Also, the bill escalated quickly, as all these little dishes add up very quickly.  I would suggest this as a place to go with one or two others who like to share, but it was not great for a larger group."

I'm not really a fan of gristle or fat on meat, which you can tend to get in a lot of Chinese restaurants.But Ping Pong is polished dim sum, there is no poor quality meat to be had here.\nMy usual list of things to order are: Traditional sticky rice parcels, the jasmine tea (with the ball!), chicken puff, har gau, spicy chicken and vegetable dumplings and char sui buns. This is usually enough for two people and me and my friend always eat them in a particular order as well.\nI like the dark decor as well, its very masculine and the seating is generally good. Though beware the curved tables at the back in this outlet, as although they have a great view are rather cramped when the food comes. Ask if you can sit downstairs if possible, it's equally as nice. There are couple of these around town, but I would say that this one has the best location and the best seating despite it not being the largest."

It's nothing authentic, but a fairly swish operation, with decent quality ingredients and drinks abound.\n The ordering process is more than a little bewildering, and though the waiting staff do offer to help out with choosing and so on (a la Wahaca), I got the feeling they wouldn't put themselves out too much. Pah, maybe they're just busy.\n We had cocktails to start off with, which possibly wasn't the smartest move, but we had to wait for a table. They were worth it though, unusual and very well made. However it meant that tastebuds were somewhat dulled when we were seated and the tea came along. The teas are great and quite well sum up the whole experience - far from authentic but snazzy. The flowering teas open up when they are poured. Nice touch.\n Anyway, back to the food. Ordering is done by ticking boxes on your own lottery-esque ticket. Pretty standard stuff on display. In addition to a large array of dumplings, we tried a few pork buns, soft shelled crab and a chef special chilli prawn concoction. All the food was tasty, yes. Didn't set my world alight, but it was tasty, arrived quickly and made me happy.\n Ping Pong do a Dim Sumday on Sundays, eat all you can / like for \u00a317. It's not a bad deal for Ping Pong, as it's not a cheap place to go on a regular day, but the formula works. Fresh, quick, accessible. People leave happy."

Well, Ping Pong's baked 'Pork Puff' that's what's not to like. This was the first dish to arrive to our table and it was essentially a mini sausage roll that someone had poured honey onto. Sickly sweet and unpleasant, it did not fill me with high hopes about the rest of the meal.\nFortunately, this was as bad as it got and although the Soft Shell Crab was greasy, all three of the steamed dim sum we chose were delicious. The service was very quick and efficient but I resented the waitress encouraging us to over order. Three to four dim sum each seemed a bit over the top and these dishes weren't cheap. In fact, being a big fan of dim sum I noticed that these prices were at least a pound more than anything you would pay in China town. Ok, you get to sit in sleek surroundings and sip cocktails but frankly I prefer my dim sum with a little more character and would rather sit in some weird Chinese back room restaurant than have another watery 'Lychee and roses' cocktail for \u00a36!"

The choice is extensive and for those who have a hard time making up their mind, there are set menus.\nYou get a pencil to tick the right menu box for the dim sum chosen. Ping Pong recommends 4-6 dishes each, which mean a table for two will be covered by all sorts of dim sum baskets in every shape and form. 'Surprise' is the right word to describe the dumplings you choose, as you do not know what it tastes like before you have tried each of them.\nI little tip, ask the waiters to not bring everything at once - it is a shame when food gets cold.

I wanted this to be a nice surprise for the birthday girl. They looked at me in a total state of confusion as to why I would want to do this. I eventually paid up and returned to the table.\n The champagne took 20 mins in getting to us, meanwhile I was trying to put everyone off ordering drinks so as not to spoil the surprise.\n The drinks eventually arrived and we ordered the food. The waitress was rude and uninterested. It took ages for her to take our ordering slip which we had promptly filled out. We each expected to make 2 or 3 rounds of orders but in the end it took 2 and a half hours for them to serve us just 2 dishes each, we gave up and I asked that the cake be bought out. Someone said they would deal with it. A few minutes later the rude waitress returned and asked loudly right infront of the birthday girl \"should I bring the cake out now?\" it was meant to have been a surprise.\n 20 mins later and the cake hadn't arrived, I asked her again, but still no cake arrived. Eventually I asked the manager who said he would deal with it which he did. However, as soon as 10 members of our party (including the birthday girl) left for a cigarette, he bought out the cake... To an empty table!!\n Eventually we complained and only paid a fraction of the bill. But this wasn't the point. It took 3 hours from start to finish and we received very little food. It totally ruined the evening and we were all still so hungry that we ended up getting noodles on the way home.\n If I could, I would only give one star.

The whole style of communal eating is condusive to a fun and social night, and their cocktails are adventurous and tasty. Best going without a budget, as the tasty dimsum treats are best ordered without holding back. Look out for the 'Chef's Specials' too as they often offer a new take on tradtional dim sum treat."

I'd never experienced dim sum before, and subsequently now find myself drooling at the prospect of another of Ping Pong's fine char sui bunsOh dear it seems I'm hooked! \nBaked chicken puffs, seafood or chive dumplings, Jasmine chicken spring rolls and crispy prawn balls headline the growing list of favourites. Not to mention the beautiful flowering Jasmine teas.\n Portions are served in pieces of 3 - perfect if you visit with a couple of friends and take a culinary tour of the unlimited Sunday menu. Arrive in a small party, and you may find yourself sharing a table downstairs - as is the norm, but here is where the similarities to some of China-Town's old-school haunts end.\n The decor is all chocolate modernism with a minimalist kick. Even a visit to the loo is all theatre here!\n My one gripe then - and this has yet to spoil the day - is that the friendly staff are only somewhat attentive, being as at some point during service we felt forgotten - on both visits.\n That said, we will be returning for what feels like a lot of luxury for only a little bit of dosh in a truly lovely setting.\n Little steamed parcels of deliciousness indeed!"

However, on the positive side, you will be eating in a nicely decorated (contemporary) environment. Recommended if going with some friends whom you are trying to impress."

Off the beaten path, yet worth the hike, take the Victoria Line to Highbury and Islington, turn right out of the station and walk 10 minutes to TravelValue heaven ... HOOAH!\nArriving 30 minutes before our reservation, thanks to an extremely efficient Tube journey, we were greeted warmly and seated at a table in the dark, romantic room surrounded by tables with white linen tablecloths each with a large candle on top. We started with bottles of Ochagavia (Chile - \u00a316.95), an oaky, scrumptious cabernet sauvignon, and Hildon sparkling water (750 ml - \u00a32.50).\nThe service impeccable, all starters are just \u00a34.45 ($6.15) and all main courses \u00a310.95 ($15.15 - except the steak which was \u00a312.95 - $18), a bargain for the quality and flavor. My wife ordered the Ch\u00e8vre Chaud Grilled Goats' Cheese starter with a salad garnish and basil pesto sauce and I had the Moules Marini\u00e8re (mussels) in a white wine and cream sauce with \"shallots, garlic, lemon and parsley\". The goat cheese tart was tastefully presented as well as being light, yet savory, and flavorful. My mussels were plentiful for the price, but there was little sauce and what was there was a tad bland with nary a hint of the shallots, garlic or parsley as noted in the description. Still, they were flavorful and a good value.\nFor our main courses, my better half had the Asperges et Cheddar Tart, small cheddar tarts topped with asparagus spears in a balsamic reduction and a sliced avocado garnish in between the two. She did not care for the dish, as I thought might be the case, because of the balsamic vinegar which she is not a great fan of to begin with. I gave her half of my Entrec\u00f4te \u0103 l'\u00e9chalotte (grilled rib eye steak - \u00a312.95), served in a lovely shallot and red wine sauce, along with some of my chips (fries for you Yanks - \u00a31.95) in return her second tart. I thought that the tart was quite delicious, but I am quite fond of balsamic and the avocado garnish was a nice, complimentary addition.\nI was stuffed, so no dessert for me, but my \"sweet\"-loving wife  (she is \"sweet\" and \"loving too) had to have her favorite, Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e (\u00a33.45), which was a bit on the small side, but scrummy nonetheless. \nAt \u00a363.42 ($87.90), including a 10% service charge, we ate like kings and queens, appropriately enough. A comparable meal would have easily set us back $110-$125 in the States. The sole \"Bomb\" deduction is due to the not-so-flavorful sauce the mussels came in and the damp slice of bread that came in our first basket, which they apologized for and quickly replaced.\nCombatCritic Gives Le Mercury 9 Bombs Out Of 10 ...

This place has a cosy warm vibe like it could be somebody's house with all the potted plants dotted around. We'd booked ahead (recommended!) so they'd saved us perhaps the best table in the far corner, meaning we got to enjoy our own little cocoon while looking out onto the street (and making eyes at each other ;), instead of facing inwards and looking at all the other tables.\nThe food was quite basic but well executed, and the service smiley and efficient. The main calling card though is the price tag, with a flat price for all starters (\u00a34ish), another for all mains (\u00a310ish) and another for all desserts (\u00a33ish). I haven't seen that strategy anywhere else in London, and I think it probably makes people end up spending more!\nI had the starter of grilled goat's cheese and leafy salad which was a very generous size, and the sea-bass fillet main with crushed new potatoes and mint pesto which was simple and tasty. The dark choc tart dessert was a bit meh. Cocktails are limited but the wine selection a bit wider (we made use of both).\nSo Michelin-starred cooking it is most certainly not, but for the romance of French food while saving the pennies I would definitely recommend!"

    "review": "\"A beautiful story\"...? \nIt has been quite a while since I visited this well known Islington French bistro. I read some reviews that made me uncomfortable but decided to go anyway. \nle Mecury is a well known Islington Upper Street establishment. I moved to the area in 2007 and have dined here with friends on many occasions. The restaurant was always busy so after a few years they opened another on Upper Street. \nThe novelty of Le Mercury was that all the starters, mains and dessert were for a set price for their category. In 2007 the price was \u00a33.45 for a starter and the portion was on the lower side of generous. Now the price has gone up by \u00a31 and the portions are smaller. However this is inflation for you. After all Islington property prices have skyrocketed in that time. \nThe food in general is good. My terrine was with spicy beetroot relish was nothing novel but tasted good. The salmon with new potatoes was well made. The salmon skin was fried perfectly and was crunchy while the fish was succulent. The creme brule was creamy with a hard sugar coating, as expected, and tasted excellent though maybe a bit smaller than I remembered. My wife also enjoyed her dishes of ravioli for starter, this apparently is the plural and should be raviolo as there was just one piece, and mushroom risotto. However the sticky toffee pudding was not very sticky, maybe best not to have English dishes at a French bistro :-)\nThe service by the waitress was excellent. Yale, originally from Paris, was attentive and was happy to hear my mumblings about living in the area... Hence the title to my review \"a beautiful story\" which is to quote her. Of course there was no question in Yale's comment but I found it amusing that she used that phrase to describe my uninteresting story. The manager could possibly learn a bit more about a friendly demeanour from her. \nIs Le Mecury special? It used to be a different place to go in upper Street that was very affordable. Now however it is competing with alot of newer and exotic establishments. The paint and food might be a bit too tired for the younger professionals moving to the area. However I see no reason to disparage this still quaint establishments which is well worth a visit."

Entrees were Sea Bass (allegedly) that looked nothing like any Sea Bass I have ever eaten. It honestly looked and tasted like trout. That is what kept me from giving a five star review.

Everything was outstanding. The atmosphere is also very nice--kinda like a nice cafe style vibe. On one hand, it's elegant with candle lit tables and on the other it's not too pretentious. \nMy only complaint is that the service felt a bit rushed. The restaurant wasn't too full and after some deliberating we decided it was because the service was poorly organized. Both waiters/waitresses were very attentive, but since they didnt seem to have control over one area and both worked the whole floor it meant that we got asked twice about everything and didnt get much breathing space. For example, we asked to have some more time to look at the menu, but someone was there asking for our orders two minutes later. This was my only complaint and the reason why they only received four stars.\nHowever, overall it was a very good experience at a great price and I wouldnt hesitate to come back!"

Is there such a thing?\nYes, there is.\nAfter going to around 7 or 8 SportDirect stores all over London (my brother really wants this particular track jacket), I was exhausted, but it seemed a bit too late for dinner -- 10 pm on a Tuesday. However, I was hungry, and after shopping for the entire day, I really did not have many pounds left. Le Mercury was highly rated on Yelp, and it was still open (I called), so I made my decision. Let me tell you: best decision of that day.\nFor one, they were able to accommodate me. Granted, I was coming in on central London, and I had called around 9 pm to see if there was any availability for one. Once I was there, I easily got a seat. The host and the hostess recognized my voice on the phone (damn my American accent) and were incredibly hospitable. I've eaten at Michelin starred restaurants, but the service I received was just the same -- at fraction of the menu prices.\nThey have a set menu that you can find on the website, so I knew I was going to have the duck, but they also had specials which were written on the chalkboard above the bar. Everything seemed delicious. I listened to their recommendations, which was the seafood ravioli, which I gobbled up in a matter of seconds (I told you I was hungry). I was blown away at the fast service, and I guess the waitress knew the look on my face as she said, \"we tend to be fast here\". Maybe it was the fact that it was 10 pm, and I missed the rush hour for dinner, but once again, service was top notch.\nBecause I ate every bite of both my meals, I was completely stuffed and could not order dessert.

The bitter part was the occasion - I attended a UYE here to say goodbye to one of my good London Yelp friends, Bea B who is moving abroad\nThe sweet part was dining here. Le Mercury is one of Bea's favourite London restaurants and with 65 reviews already, it must be one of London's most Yelped businesses at this time. These Yelpers, including some of my trusted Yelp friends with good palates, had graded it with a solid 4 stars, so I was looking forward to eating here\nA perusal of the menu revealed a bistro style line up of French classics. Arriving at the restaurant, I found a setting and ambiance to match that relaxed bistro menu though perhaps, this stepped on the wrong side of shabby in the men's toilets which were in need of some refurbishment\nWe didn't have snooty French waiting staff to complete the French atmosphere but our waiter was efficient if not exactly warm. Le Mercury has a nice pricing plan with all starters costing \u00a33.95, main courses costing \u00a38.45 and desserts costing \u00a32.95. which are very decent prices for this part of London\nThe food arrived remarkably quicky but the speed didn't mean sacrificing elegant presentation or suffering inaccurately cooked food. My roast Barbary duck breast had perfectly rendered crispy skin and moist meat, well complemented by garlic mash and Savoy cabbage with red wine jus. Asking round the table, there were murmurs of approval for rib eye steak and salmon though one of the steaks was a little under cooked.\nFor desserts, I had a rich and decadent chocolate tart and the poached pear was so good that it was half demolished before I could get a photo of it.\nIf Le Mercury was in France, we'd be nodding our heads sagely and admiring how it was produce well-priced and flavoursome food. So, to summarise, I'm nodding my head sagely and saying,\"Bravo, Le Mercury!\"\nAnd lastly, we'll miss you, Bea!!"

This is one of the most flavorful mussels dishes we have eaten this year and at less than \u00a36 the best value. \n3. Duck breast main- cooked a tad more medium than rare, however sauce was rich and good for winter. Potatoes soaked it up well. Also they switched out cabbage for grilled courgette which was nice. \n4.

Went exceptionally well with the cheese platter. We are actively seeking out this sweet treat to have at home. \n6. Cheese platter- they graciously switched out blue for more of the others. The others were Brie and Gruyere, the Brie served with perfectly sweet biscuits and the Gruyere with grapes. \nBees was a little disappointing as it wasn't French baguette. Overall very happy wit this place. A cozy warm bistro atmosphere of friendly people who were very accommodating. Oh yea and a \u00a335 bill for a lot of food and drinks for two people. C'est la vie."

There was a relaxed atmosphere up on the top floor and the service was really friendly, so we were happy to be there.\nFor starters, I had calamari, delicious.  Main course was steak frites, no complaints whatsoever!  Dessert, a banoffi pie.  A reasonable size, and a third delicious out of three.  We had house red wine and it was surprisingly good.  I'd almost give this place five stars for a cheap and good French dinner."

For my main course I enjoyed the roasted duck breast. It was cooked to perfection and melted in the mouth. I finished the evening with creme Brule, which was, per usual, a delicate and tasty dessert. \nOn top of the excellent food the atmosphere of Le Mercury is very well thought out. The candle lit tables are lovely and the decor on the walls is playful, yet also chic. This place is perfect for a date, birthday or anniversary dinner."

The sauce was tasty not too fishy but had a rich creamy taste and the contents of ravioli were cooked to perfection. My girlfriend ch\u00e8vre chaud. Goats cheese on a bit of bread with a green salad dressing. Everything on that plate complimented each other and tasted sublime! \nFor main I had the entrec\u00f4te cooked medium rare. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had so rich and meaty but cooked to perfection. It was served with au jus and a side of french fries. It was a simple dish but tasted amazing. \n My girlfriend had the corn fed chicken everything on that was great from the gravy to the beans. \nDesert well you guessed it, that was amazing as well. I had the poached pear with vanilla ice cream. Just great. Flavoured with cinnamon and cloves the pear was glazed with a crispy sugar shell. It was a light way to end the meal. My lady had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was pretty standard. We both agreed my desert was the best. \nThe wine was great I had the Shiraz and my girlfriend had the Pinot Grigio. Also the espresso Martini was a great way to finish the meal. If you've read this far the. Thanks! \nAll in all it was a great night. Very well priced for the food you were served and the atmosphere was typically french. A great french style meal in the heart of London that won't break the bank."

What I love about this place is the consistency in quality, and the lack of artificial light (candles only after a certain time) so it makes for a really cosy atmosphere. \nMy worst meal here was a Christmas group meal with friends. I hadn't realised the set menu would be quite so bland, and the toast which accompanied my pate was cold... \nStill, I will definitely continue coming here for meals with my boyfriend, or catch-up dinners with friends."

They managed to find us a table, but it was perhaps the worst table in the restaurant.  We were upstairs in a corner where the windows were completely blocked by plants.  Not very conducive to a romantic evening...\nThe only plus side to Le Mercury is that it is very affordable.  But the food is cheap for a reason.\nWe started with the ravioli, which was \"meh.\"  Then I had the duck, which was the better of the two entrees and my hubby had the rib-eyed steak, which was vastly overdone. All of it was only lukewarm by the time it arrived at our table.\nThe service was terrible and slow.  I don't know if they resented having an extra table, but they never refilled our water and only bothered to check on us when they were dropping off our food.\nSuffice it to say, though I live only a few blocks way, we will not be back."

I love this place so much that I have been back twice in the past week... don't judge me... The service is excellent as well. \nFor starter I enjoyed the grilled goat cheese served on a pesto salad and it was perfectly done. Other people in my group seemed to really like their lobster ravioli starters. My husband chose the calamari but it was a little under done for my taste, not crispy at all so I would probably skip that one in the future. \nFor mains my favorite so far is the Salmon served over sauteed spinach with a lobster cream sauce. Delicious! Other popular menu items among my group were the duck, the grilled swordfish, and the pork belly. All in all this was a fantastic meal at a great price. Perfection!"

Its like the blueprint for a successful restaurant! \nWe went one Monday night with friends. We had a cocktail at John Salt beforehand (2 for 1 until 8pm!) and then headed to Le Mercury. We had an upstairs table and service was great-attentive, but not over the top. We all had three courses (huge treat on Monday) but portion size means you don't feel too full. \nBetween us we tried the moules, ravioli, carpaccio and calamari for starters. The calamari was a little disappointing, but all the other starters were excellent. They all cost \u00a33.95, so pretty amazing value. All mains are \u00a38.95. I had the duck which was served on a bed of garlic mash and with some cabbage. If I had one quibble it would be that the duck was slightly over-cooked, but I understand not everyone likes pink in the middle duck. The garlic mash was amazing- I would've been happy with a bowl of that and a spoon! Other people had the lamb, seabass and rib of beef all were well cooked, and the fries the boys ordered were yummy. \nFor desert I had creme brulee. Not bad for \u00a32.95, but the topping could've been slightly thicker. Others had the cheese platter, the rich chocolate tart and the cheesecake. All plates were practically licked clean. \nWe shared two bottles of a decent cab sav and the bill came a few pounds over \u00a3100, pretty incredible value! The food here will never blow your socks off, but it's a dependable neighbourhood bistro and we'll continue to come here regularly. Until next time Le Mercury...."

    "review": "I was pleasantly surprised at Le Mercury. We decided to go someplace for dinner before a friend's birthday party and we just ended up here. It's advertised as a French restaurant, but there's a bit of other stuff as well. Unless you get a special, the starters are all \u00a33.95, the mains \u00a38.95 and desserts are \u00a32.95. \nSo given the price, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. However, my lobster and crab ravioli was really nice (although the sauce could have had a bit more flavor), the duck was tasty (although it was more medium well than medium rare) and the cheese dessert (for \u00a32.95) was three massive slices of brie, gruyere and blue. \nWhile the food wasn't perfect, it was cheap and it was tasty, so that's a bonus. They also had a fairly interesting wine list, and the wine we chose was really tasty and went great with the duck. Finish it off with a glass of port and it was one of the cheaper meals we've had in quite awhile.\nSo if you're on the lookout for cheap and tasty food, head here. We didn't have a reservation, and showed up at 6:15, and they told us they'd seat us if we could finish in an hour. Which we did. So they're willing to squeeze you in as well. (I imagine it's one reason they can keep prices so low, a huge turnover)."

Maybe we caught them on a bad day - rainy Saturday for lunch - but there was nothing particularly memorable or good about this place other than the reasonable prices (\u00a35 starters, \u00a310 mains, and a cheap wine list)\nThe service was really, really bad.  I think our server's vision was based on movement since the only way he ever dropped by our table was after desperate waving by one or more of us -- take our order, water, wine order #1, wine order #2, dessert order, check (twice).  We were exhausted by the end.\nThe food was unremarkable, and not particularly French (just because the menu says  \"croquette de poisson\" doesn't make fishcakes french.)  Two of us had the over-cooked swordfish over a bed of cold string beans.  A friend ordered a salad that we all agreed looked like the one you get in coach on a British Airlines flight.  The crayfish and lobster ravioli (also, ravioli... not french) starter was good but I suspect they bought them frozen from somewhere.  I had the chicken entree which was ok.\nThe most entertaining part was the STEEP decent down slippery metal stairs to the toilet.  As a bonus the water was running in the dirty sink and couldn't be turned off.\nOne star experience overall, but I'm giving them two stars because it was cheap.  You get what you pay for."

But I won't hold it against them because the next two times I got the duck, which was delicious. I always get the french fries as a side and it is a good size to share for two. \nFor two starters, two mains, a side, a dessert, and a bottle of wine, you're looking at about \u00a350 for two, which is a good deal for the area and a total dining experience."

Boneless lamb, no fat, medium rare and cooked to perfection. I have to say that I judge a restaurant by how well they cook their lamb because most of the times it's too dry or too gamy. Le Mercury's lamb was perfectly seasoned, no chewy rubber band like parts, just the right amount of meat to sauce balance, I was 100% satisfied. My friend ordered: Boulettes de pomme de terre (Sauteed potato dumplings with baby artichokes, parmesan foam and wild rocket salad).

I booked about 4 days ahead and they only had one reservation for the whole evening left. Wowie.\nPrices are so reasonable! We weren't modest at all, with drinks or food, and our tab only came out to 38 quid! For our starter we had the goats cheese which is absolutely TO DIE FOR. It's a must paired with the French merlot on the menu. Take a nice bite of the cheese with a swig of the wine and trust me, it's divine. For my main I had both the pear salad and the crab appetiser. The salad was lovely, the blue cheese and poached pair were the perfect combination. However, I was not a fan of the crab dish as it was made with mayonnaise, which I hate. I really wished they had clarified on the menu how it was made. BUT it worked out alright because I wanted to have room for desert anyway. My man enjoyed the duck entree, which he said was cooked perfectly and was \"out of this world.\" And yes, only for 6.95!\nThe reason why I didn't give Le Mercury 5 stars is because the service isn't good. But I do personally think sacrificing the level of service to keep the ridiculously cheap prices IS worth it. However, we did always have to flag our waiter down and we weren't greeted at our table until about 15 minutes after sitting. But lets face it, they were packed and this place was hoppin.

    "review": "Excellent value on Upper Street, among restaurants that are usually overpriced!\n The atmosphere is romantic, making this the perfect place to bring a date if you are on a budget. All starters cost \u00a33.95 and all main courses at \u00a36.95. They do have a changing daily menu with more expensive options, but they are only at \u00a37.95.\n Portions are rather big, making this an extremely good value place. The main courses were a bit slow to arrive, but the service in general was very prompt.\n The menu has a french slant, with many British dishes as well. Unusual ones include frogs legs, along with the traditional steaks and leg of lamb."

These two restaurants serving French cuisine were suggested by friends I was catching up with and that I haven't heard of. One was to celebrate a birthday and the other was visiting friends in town. \nLet's start with a birthday dinner at Le Mercury. It was a cold windy evening and I was walking with a fast pace dreaming of the warmth that will greet me when I open the doors of the restaurant. In I went and was led up a flight of narrow wooden stairs to my table. \nIt was a very reasonably priced menu with all starters priced at \u00a33.95\nWe ordered a trio of starters starting with the Calamars Fris which is deep fried calamari with home made tartar sauce and dressed French leaves on the side, Beef Carpaccio with capers and red peppers relish and finishing with the Ravioli de la Mer, a crayfish and lobster ravioli with spinach and shellfish sauce.\nFor mains which were all price at \u00a36.95, there was the sea bass fillet with crushed new potatoes and minted pesto, a rib eye steak served with shallot sauce and a Scottish salmon with saut\u00e9ed spinach and lobster sauce. \nWe all had a great time soaking in the atmosphere and vibe. It can indeed be quite a romantic place. The food may not be outstanding but is decent and with those prices, reflects a good value. An unassuming place that might not reside in your memories for long but will be thought of fondly if this happens to be part of your local eaterie."

    "review": "Very disappointing! We came here after several recommendations (and reading the positive reviews here), and found the food mediocre at best.  I had the crab and crayfish ravioli and the pork belly, and my wife had the crab and avocado starter and the beef stew special.  The crab in both appetisers was imitation crab meat, which was not mentioned on the menu and was particularly noticeable in the special.  The pork belly was dry and overcooked and the beef stew was virtually flavourless.  The two bright spots were the wine and the sticky toffee pudding (which in my opinion is good even when it's bad).\nGranted, the prices are extremely generous, but considering you can get 2 courses and a glass of wine for \u00a317 at places like Public House, I wonder if Le Mercury is really that good a deal.  \nMaybe we just went on a bad night or maybe we ordered the wrong items, but will definitely not be returning any time soon, particularly with so many other great restaurants in the area."

However, the atmosphere, wine, food, and wine all seem to make this a safe bet. \nI've tried the lobster ravioli, the duck (err... canard), the potato dumplings, the salmon, the sea bass, and a couple of the desserts. All were either very good or great. For some extra Frenchness, they refused my sister's simple meal modification request- no, the sauce could not be had on the side. Authentique!\nThe best part is that it is so inexpensive. Considering how good the food is, 8 quid for a main course is a steal. That means you will have some money left over to treat your special lady to a couple drinks at that most romantic of bars just down the street- Slim Jim's Liquor Store! No way will that date not end well, eh?"

My friend ordered two starters:  the ravioli and the calamari.  I believe the ravioli was the star here as it was served along a buttery seafood sauce that was balanced very well with the spinach in the dish.  \nTried my friend's calamari and to be candid, it wasn't the greatest (doesn't match the fantastic fried Calamari I exprienced at the Capital Grille in Philadelphia, absolutely tasty!!!).  Seasoned ok, a bit cold for my taste.\nOut came my steak and it was so flavorful and tasty!!  Downside here was that it could've been more tender (ordered it medium) and it felt like it was warm, but not hot.  Next time will tell them to bring everything out as its ready so it's nice and hot!!\nWe didn't have desert as we were too full.  Final verdict: nice decore, good food, can't beat the prices for a nice, sit down French meal in London.

    "review": "Overall an excellent experience. I came here on a Friday night (with a reservation) with two other people. This restaurant has some sort of \"shift\" system, I think, where all the diners come in at once. I arrived a little before 9:15pm (for a 9:15 pm reservation) and the place was empty; by 9:20pm it was full and buzzing. I've never seen this system before but I suppose there could be some advantages.\nThe restaurant itself is lovely. We sat on the first floor, where large windows look onto the street. Nicely arranged tables and decor. I would say it seemed a bit noisy at times, but I am sometimes a bit sensitive to loudness. (I loathe most night clubs.) The bathrooms in the basement are a bit lackluster, so I didn't spend much time down there.\nThe servers were good and attentive. We ordered a very nice bottle of merlot and to start shared mussels and poached pear with walnuts and blue cheese; all were very good. I had the roast chicken as entree and it was great, very tender and moist. I sampled my companions' dishes as well - sea bass and duck - and both were succulent to say the least. The portions did not seem like much but the richness of the foods really filled me up. We also squeezed in some dessert - creme brulee and the dark chocolate tort. Delicious they both were.\nThe main draw of Le Mercury, though, has to be the prices. Wine: appx. \u00a315 for a bottle, starters \u00a33.95 each, entrees \u00a37.95 each, desserts \u00a32.95 each. For London these prices really are unheard of. \nI will recommend this place to everybody, and I hope to go back soon."

Nothing to complain about!\nFood: \n- Appetizer: Mussels in a broccoli sort of soup? It was good! Good amount and the sauce/soup it was in was delicious. I've had moules frites (in Belgium!) and this was definitely good in comparison to it.\n- Pork with confit: I thought it was a bit dry. I ate all of it.. minus a bit of the pork.

Curses!\nBut, this is one of my favorite spots in London- so long as I remember it exists. The entrees are delightful. I had pork belly on a bed of (not over cooked) cabbage covered in a berry sauce that my taste buds singing the opening of \"The Sound of Music\". Actually, I refer to this place as French-ish, because I'm not sure if it is supposed to be totally French (mainly because its such an unassuming and friendly place. Ooooh burn, France!)\nThe most magical thing about this restaurant are the prices.... you will do a double take when you get the bill.

I just want to go there again and again. \nI think I may be in love with a restaurant....\nI think it gets pretty busy on the weekends so you may want to make a reservation but it does stay open until 1 so its perfect for a late, late dinner."

The waiters are very efficient... some may say a little too eager to get you in, served and out, but I'm quite partial to a bit of efficiency on a cold wintery night when I'm starving. A three course meal will set you back \u00a317. And that's the entire menu - starters, mains and desserts are all the same price.\n Toilets are fairly interesting... but clean.\n We dined on Carpaccio of Beef, Fois Gras, Sea Bass, Belly Pork, Marscapone Cheesecake and Sticky Toffee pudding. Delicious. Can't comment on the booze as we were driving, but French wine isn't really my thing anyway. Oh - driving - easy peasy.

It was all perfectly cooked and a perfect portion size for me.  My friend ordered the steak and he loved it...a rarity for him, since he's usually got something to complain about no matter where he goes!\nAlthough we came in quite late without a reservation we were still seated immediately with a quick warning that they were closing in 45 minutes or so...though that didn't end up mattering much at all, since the service was incredibly quick.\nThe atmosphere is a bit romantic-y, with candles and all of that, but it wasn't filled with the kind of gooey lovey couples who might make a night out with a platonic male friend a bit awkward.\nI just wish I'd tried something from the dessert menu...Oh well.  Just gives me an excuse to go back!"

I suggest trying the duck entree and the poached pear dessert, both of which are some of the best dishes I have ever experienced.  Every time I am in London I will be eating at Le Mercury."

The best thing about this place is the value for money compared to other restaurants in the area, a glance at the menu may leave you feeling a little nervous about the cuisine but don't be put off by the almost too modest prices. \nThe food would have been excellent if it had been hotter, but this is a restaurant that's packed almost every night of the week and the highly efficient waiters are rushed off their feet to deliver food to all three floors of the restaurant (you will probably have to book - try to get a table on the ground floor).  A great place to take someone if you're on a budget - because you won't feel like you are."

When I can't get a reservation at Ottolenghi across the street, I'm not disappointed by Le Mercury as a backup.  I have them saved in my phone. \nThe moules marinieres are perfect and not rubbery, the duck is always cooked to perfection, the salmon juicy, the lobster ravioli is a winner, and although I've never had it, the pork belly always seems to make my husband very satiated.  The deserts are nice, but their strengths are their starters and mains.  The wine list has a fair mix of options, most worth buying by the bottle and none too offensively priced. \nThe last two times I have been there I've been seated upstairs which is more private, but I prefer the seating downstairs for a cafe/french style atmosphere."

These two restaurants serving French cuisine were suggested by friends I was catching up with and that I haven't heard of. One was to celebrate a birthday and the other was visiting friends in town.\nLet's start with a birthday dinner at Le Mercury. It was a cold windy evening and I was walking with a fast pace dreaming of the warmth that will greet me when I open the doors of the restaurant. In I went and was led up a flight of narrow wooden stairs to my table.\nIt was a very reasonably priced menu with all starters priced at \u00a33.95\nWe ordered a trio of starters starting with the Calamars Fris which is deep fried calamari with home made tartar sauce and dressed French leaves on the side, Beef Carpaccio with capers and red peppers relish and finishing with the Ravioli de la Mer, a crayfish and lobster ravioli with spinach and shellfish sauce.\nFor mains which were all price at \u00a36.95, there was the sea bass fillet with crushed new potatoes and minted pesto, a rib eye steak served with shallot sauce and a Scottish salmon with saut\u00e9ed spinach and lobster sauce.\nWe all had a great time soaking in the atmosphere and vibe. It can indeed be quite a romantic place. The food may not be outstanding but is decent and with those prices, reflects a good value. An unassuming place that might not reside in your memories for long but will be thought of fondly if this happens to be part of your local eaterie."

    "review": "OK I know I'm going against the grain here but bear with me.  I went a couple of weeks ago for the first time with Lucy who raves about it so I had high expectations. A major bonus was the fact that due to volcanic activity (what else?), mutual friend's flight was seriously delayed so we arrived about 45mins after we had the table booked for.  There was no problem with this, despite the fact that it is nearly always fully-booked so that was great. Lucy noted that the prices had gone up since the last time she'd been, so while still cheap (7.45, specials of the day around 9 or 10 pounds), not as cheap as they used to be.  My starter was great, my steak was cooked to perfection but not of the highest quality as I was still chewing it over literally 10 minutes after Lucy and friend had finished. Not a good look! The sticky toffee pudding (a passion of mine) was a little dry and not as sticky as it should have been.\nI thought I'd give it another go for boyfriend's birthday meal as everyone else seems to think it's amazing so I wondered if I'd gone on an off-night. \nNot so, sadly.  The maitre d' sat us, a waiter brought over some wine (complementary wine! How thoughtful!) but it wasn't ours and turned out to be the first of many errors of the evening.  After some time, the maitre d' took our order without writing it down (why do people do this? I've been a waitress and could NEVER remember orders without writing them down - it turns out that this guy couldn't either) so when the starters came, I got the soup I'd ordered, boyfriend got something he didn't.  It was replaced quickly though and we had complementary bread and butter to keep us going which is a plus. \nMy soup was a disappointment though. French onion is another passion of mine but I make it far better than what I was given - watery, thin, with little flavour.  Boyfriend's poached pear with blue cheese was lovely though. \nSome 45 minutes after we had had our starter, I asked where our main courses were and they arrived soon after. I think 45 minutes is a very long time between courses and we were filling up on bread.\nAnyway, for main I had pork belly which I'd expected to be a slice of meat layered with fat and with a nice chunk of crackling on top. Again, not so. It was a huge lump of tasty pork, not a scrap of crackling to be seen and not enough jus to counteract the dryness of the meat.  I ended up drinking so much water with it (I can't leave meat, an animal has died for this so I'm not wasting any of it!) that by the end of the meal I was absolutely full to bursting. So much meat and you only get vegetables / chips etc if you order them (1.95 on top) which presented another problem. I ordered a side salad (mixed leaves, 4 slices of cucumber with only the slightest hint of dressing, 1.95 seems very steep for that) while boyfriend ordered chips and a vegetable selection which it seems the maitre d' forgot.  When we reminded him, we were shortly presented a plate of beans, new potatoes and the oddest carrots which looked like they had been boiled, then left in a low oven for many hours so that all the water had been removed from them. Wrinkled, dehydrated and burnt around the edges. Very strange and not nice to eat! \nBy the end of all that, I wasn't hungry for dessert which is just as well as it took another 20 minutes to get the bill.  \nNot bad in that the whole thing was 35.00 for 2 people with a glass of wine and a beer but I wonder if we're all mistaking good value for cheap?\nLet me know if I'm wrong, but I'm not charmed by Le Mercury."

    "review": "Hello new favourite restaurant!\n Seriously, is there nothing this place doesn't offer? When someone suggests a French restaurant, you immediately think it's going to be pricey, but this couldn't be further from the truth. All of the mains are under \u00a37, desserts under \u00a33.\n So what did we have? Well we shared a starter of Crayfish and Lobster ravioli which was yummy. really nice. I think we were both a bit annoyed that we didn't order one each.\n But the mains were ace too - it's not a huge selection, but it's a good one. I had duck breast on garlic mash with cabbage. It had a great sauce, although I can't remember what was in it. The mash was really too garlicky for my taste, but the duck was perfect. Yummy yummy yummy. We didn't get a side of veg with our meals, but we did spie roasted potatoes and green beans on a nother table and were instantly jealous. My friend's mushroom rissotto was yummy too. Dessert was a mascarpone cheesecake. YUMMY!\n There was nothing bad about this place, it's a gorgeous little find. We booked ahead, and we might have been lucky but it's not a bad idea. The service isn't the best, but my friends and i were catching up so we didn't really mind that they didn't take our order for a while - in fact I think they were waiting for us to shut up! In the meantime we ate all of the bread that they gave us. Freshest bread eve. The place is open very late (1am on weekdays, 2am on weekends) so you could even pop in after going to the cinema. It's a little further up Upper Street than the main drag, but that's a good thing. If I was just looking for somewhere to grab a bite to eat, I wouldn't have walked up this far. I'm so pleased I did!\n So one starter, one dessert and two very yummy mains, plus a couple of glasses of wine costs us \u00a326. Very impressed indeed.\n Do come here! On a date, with friends, whatever. Just come here. We were in such a mood for all things French that we've booked the Eurostar to Paris next month! Doesn't get much better"

The starter was the best out of the three dishes, it was the mussels in white wine (not as fresh, but they were only \u00a33.95).  The salmon was tasty with the lobster sauce but I was let down by the food's temperature, as if it had been left on the side for a bit before serving it.

Its no wonder that its always packed - but you don't have to wait long for a table. The steak was the best I've had in a while, soft and tender with a shallot sauce. At only 6.50 pounds, it was an absolute bargain! Starters are also very good, and around 4 pounds each. A bottle of wine is pretty reasonable at 10.50 as well. \nThe restaurant gives the atmosphere of an intimate high end eatery, and the dim lighting and soft candles save it from looking like a bistro. This is a perfect place to go for a pre-theater or cinema meal, as the fast service won't keep you waiting long for a great meal. The Creme Brulee is still a simple favorite that is on the menu. Have with an espresso for the perfect meal!"

Things can get packed in pretty tight, so it's best to make a booking (even on a Monday night at 8pm we wouldn't have been able to get a table if we hadn't already reserved one).\n The food is quite good, even if the menu isn't terribly extensive. My sea bass was fantastic, nice a crispy on the outside but really moist on the inside. Their desserts are really nice too, but don't expect anything on the lighter side. But the portions are perfect, just enough to leave you feeling satisfied without feeling stuffed. And things are relatively cheap with three courses costing only about \u00a315 (excluding drinks).\n It's a really good late night spot as well; they're open til 2, and they won't rush you if you want to sit around and chat after your meal.

The vibe is very French bistro and a bit like Lucien in NYC which used to be our favourite place for a mildly celebratory dinner so that's good. The restaurant is crowded but unlike a crowded NYC restaurant you aren't putting your elbows in your neighbour's soup.\n Tiny paper napkins and diner-standard flatware/glasses are all that's on the table. Meg arrives, we get the menus, and order drinks. We get glasses of tap water, which are never refilled, and a bottle of chenin blanc which turns out to be a 2008 from Long Beach winery in South Africa. This is a little sweet, but very nice - I like it a lot. The bread is pretty plain-jane white bread, but it has poppy seeds on the outside which make it better than expected.\n Meg has Tian au Crabe which is described on the menu as Tian of crab and avocado emulsion. What is a tian? We don't know which seems as good a reason as any to order it. It turns out to be something like crab salad. Meg seems to enjoy it.\n I have Chevre Chaud, grilled goat's cheese with fresh leaf salad and basil pesto. This is quite good although I think rather too heavy on the goat cheese and not heavy enough on the pesto as it's a little dry. The salad is nothing special and in fact I was hoping for more leaves. Weirdly, I guess, I'm asking for them to have more of the cheap ingredients in this dish.\n For mains, Meg gets Supreme de Poulet Roti - roast breast of chicken, garlic mash, green peppercorn. She seems to like it. I have Filet de Loup de Mer - sea bass with cauliflower puree, raisins, and chili lemon zest. Everything individually is good but they don't seem to go together that well.\n And that's it.

To some, that's off putting or inauthentic. But when done in a respectful way - and tasty way, who cares? When you finally get called for saying they hit a drum and yell something that's supposed to be in Japanese. Cute and sets the Japanese motif. \nI like that you are able to request noodle doneness for the ramen. In general, I found the ramen (we tried two different ones) to be a little bland but otherwise really good. It had the nice soft boiled egg (but with a slightly reddish yolk). The BBQ pork bao was pretty delicious with a substantial piece of meat. The Soho platter was a pretty posh sampler of food including sashimi, tempura, and Kara age chicken for two. They even had a near-frozen Asahi beer that really hit the spot against the fatty broth of the ramen. We skipped the cocktails but they looked really delicious.\nWe skipped dessert but overall, it was a pretty good meal and surprisingly inexpensive vs. expectations. Would definitely recommend this place for ramen cravings!"

Shoryu Ramen definitely surpassed my expectations.\nThe broth was flavorful, and the noodles cooked to perfection. Service was great for us, as we came before the rush, as they quickly took our orders and brought out the food in a timely manner. The restaurant is a bit small, but it is nice and cozy.

    "review": "It was our last night in London....and knowing that we had a long night ahead of reluctantly packing to head back in Atlanta....Hubby and I opted to stop by here for a simple warm dinner, and romantic walk under the Christmas lights on Regent street. \nShoryu came highly recommended by friends and yelpers. It was a cold night so a warm bowl of ramen seemed like a perfect option. We hopped in a uber and arrived with no reservations made prior. Luckily, it was not too busy despite being a Friday night. We were able to find cozy two seats at the front right corner so we could people watch (very fun on a Friday night). \nI love the detail of purse hooks under the table. \nThey offer specials such as seasonal set menu, Bun Monday, and Happy Sake hour. \nShoryu Ramen started in Nov. 2012 and recommend in the Michelin Guide since 2014 (you still see the sticker at the entrance). They specialize in Hakata Tonkotsu ramen (aka, rich-thick- white pork broth with straight ramen noodles). Ricky and I both ordered the same Shoryu tonkatsu ramen ....and the broth was amazing! You can tell it has been cooking for many hours with great quality ingredients. And do not forget about the noodles made from fresh Shoryu flour! Fresh, bouncy, and chewy. You can request different textures to your liking. The ramen comes with the traditional toppings of a soft boiled egg, pork, and veggies,and nori. All the toppings were excellent as well.....but I am a BIG soup and noodles person so those are the items that grabbed by attention the most. \nThe gyoza is supposed to be really good here but unfortunately no one told me -_-. I didn't find this out till after I left the restaurant. The uber driver asked me if I got the dumplings on the ride back to the hotel. We got the takoyaki instead which was so-so. \nAnother popular item is the HIrata Bun. Hubby got the wagyu beef filled bun. They names it the Shoryu bun to bring prosperity to you when you eat it :) Very cute. \nThis location also has quiet an extensive alcohol selection. Def check this out. There was a reason everyone inside was drinking lol. \nHighly recommend. Great place for ramen."

They were still tasty but I would probably pass on them on any subsequent visit.\nThe ramen was quite good and you have the choice of how you would like your noodles prepared. The broth of the Hakata Tonkotsu was flavorful, savory, and rich. The double nitamago egg was eggsellent. The Dracula Tonkotsu is filled with tasty garlic bits and flavour but may require an after-meal mint. \n3.5 stars overall."

We stopped by shoryu, which was decently busy on a weekday late afternoon. We were asked to wait outside for a few minutes as they were cleaning the tables. \nI got the dracula tonkotsu and my fiance ordered the tonkotsu with the more intense/ thicker broth. We both enjoyed our meal - you can order the noodles cooked to your preferred doneness (standard, firm, etc.) and the egg that came with the noodles was cooked perfectly. My soup base was a little too garlicky for my tastes, but that was my fault since the description clearly detailed that it was for garlic lovers. My fiance said this was probably one of the better ramen places he's eaten at (and we've been to plenty in Chicago and NY)\nThe meal was a little pricey for what it was, but we were in the heart of London so I expect part of it was due to location so can't really complain there."

I had my noodles cooked normally and the ramen came topped with pork belly, mushroom and green onion. That was actually perfect because I wouldn't eat the egg anyway. The noodles here are the thinner kind, not the chewy thick ones (I prefer the thicker noodles). The bowl was kind of small. Normally, when I eat ramen, I get a bigger bowl with more soup. \nThe soup was good, but nothing mind-blowing, especially when they advertised their soup to be 12 hour soup.\nThe service was quick and efficient. I really liked how if you asked for tap water, they gave you a whole bottle, even though I was only 1 person.  \nOverall, the ramen was good.

NO. JOKE. I'm STILL thinking about those perfectly seasoned eggs. No wonder they're on the Michelin recommended list two years in a row!\n~ Atmosphere:\nCute atmosphere - nothing fancy. The wall has a great description of the parts of ramen, if you're new to this amazing dish you can read up on it! Even though I'm a ramen fanatic, I still learners a bit about the ramen styles of different regions in Japan.\n~ Customer Service:\nReally lovely. The waitress who served us was very sweet and friendly, and our food came out at a decent time (not alarmingly quick like they do in Japan, but still at a relatively decent time). They also provide fresh garlic you can crush right into your ramen if you're a garlic fanatic like me.\n~ Food:\nThis where the 5 stars comes from. Everything else could be literally GARBAGE and I would still give this place 5 stars. We ordered Pork Belly Buns to start off with and they were fantastic. I'll be honest - I've had better baos elsewhere so next time I come I'll probably skip on the baos and go straight to the ramen just to get a better taste value for money.\nI ordered the Dracula Ramen (garlic tonkotsu ramen) and it was out of this world. You can order extra toppings so I opted for an extra seasoned egg. After I finished my first plate of eggs I wish I had no shame and order an extra plate. You're also allowed to ask for extra noodles or meat - all at a price of course but I'm definitely glad they had that option available.\nChoose the firmness of your noodles and you're ready to go - the result? The most AMAZING ramen. The depth of flavour of my ramen was immense and you can definitely bet that I slurped up all the remaining broth after I was done. If you're a ramen snob and here to compare Shoryu to the other ramen powerhouses of the world, I would say that the broth is what sets this place apart. The char siu was forgettable, but the broth and eggs were UNFORGETTABLE. I'll be thinking about this ramen for years to come.\n---\nDo yourself a favour and get to Shoryu Ramen. Probably the best in London."

I went for the double tonkatsu broth and had a side of the black sesame tofu as a starter. The tofu was inter sting and a very instagrammable dish but not a must order. Tasted like a black sesame jello as it needed a little more sauce/wetness to it. The ramen itself was very solid. Large portion and tons of noodles. Noodles are hard and perhaps the best I've ever had. The fact that you can pick your thickness is awesome to me and really gives each ramen dish it's own rather than churned out in a factory. Chasu was thick but I wouldn't necessarily call it pork belly as mine had virtually no fat. Broth was thick and meaty, but lacked spice. Even with the piri piri side sauce I was still hoping for more. The ramen did not disappoint and it's no surprise they've expanded throughout the city. Biggest complaint was that they charged for still water when all I want d was tap. An upsell like that hurts and seems very seedy. But food wise, one of the better ramens I've had."

The restaurant was quite close to Piccadilly Circus and located right on the main street, so quite easy for us to find it.

Although the restaurant wasn't big, we just like it here. \nWhen we were here, it was quite busy. It is always a good sign for a good restaurant.

Well, I just wanted to try out the Ramen here first. And I forgot that outside of Germany, it is quite common that restaurant will gave free water on the table. We ordered extra drinks, well, got more options anyway. \nI really like the Ramen here, it tasted really good.

The second thing is that the waiters are going to explain the entire menu to you if you say you've never been there before, down to every last detail. It's kind of patronizing.\nI love spicy ramen and will almost always pick it over the others. Their menu lists a traditional tonkatsu, but then it also lists a Kotteri Hakata Tonkatsu ramen that has a richer and thicker sauce. There was an unnecessary amount of confusion when I asked if the spicy Piri Piri Tonkatsu was made with the traditional tonkatsu, or the Kotteri - the waitress explained to me what tonkatsu was three times in a row. So I just ordered it.\nIf you like spicy ramen, the Piri Piri is the way to go. The broth was smooth and silky and had just enough heat to make your forehead sweat a little, but not enough to burn your tastebuds into oblivion. The noodles were perfect, smooth and not overdone. I didn't like that they added raw jalapeno and ginger though. The ginger kind of threw off the rest of the flavor and I avoided the jalapeno because I didn't want my mouth to catch on fire.\nIf you're in London and have a ramen craving then this is your place.

It would have been so much better with a little vinegar.\nThe ramen itself was good - decent portions - toppings were limited and expensive for extras. The noodles were cooked well as was the poached egg. Soup was flavorful and came with good slices of pork. \nService was nice and friendly.

The scallions and red ginger give the ramen a fresh taste while adding heat. There is white pepper. A sesame seed grinder. Hot oil and  sauce to add to your ramen. They only thing that was annoying is they had a gong that was very loud and they banged it every time someone came in."

    "review": "Great ramen place. We came late on a Thursday night and the place was still busy with a nice atmosphere. We started off with a chicken bun each first -- they were great. A thick pancake with cucumber and hoisin sauce with a nice big piece of fried chicken in it. Next we both had a ramen dish, I had the recommended Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu -- which was a nice filling dish. We also had the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu, which was similar to my dish but spicy -- it was really good. If you like spicy food I'd chose this dish over the other one. A nice meal out, about \u00a312 for a bowl of ramen. Not to bad of prices, seen though it's right down the street from Piccadilly Circus. Easy walk to and from the tube."

The soup I got was good, and I liked the spicy sauce available on the table, but something was a bit off. Although the pork belly was good, it was obvious that it was not very fresh. It was seasoned well, but it shared a similar flavor with the turkey that you'd have a few days after thanksgiving.

    "review": "Having been spoiled silly this year with highly anticipated trips to both Ippudo (\nyelp.com/biz/ippudo-ny-n\u2026\n) and Momofuku (\nyelp.com/biz/momofuku-no\u2026\n) over in New York city, I was thrilled to see what the city of London had to offer in terms of pork buns and ramen. Behold: Shoryu. The verdict? Better than Momofuku Noodle Bar, but just shy of Ippudo.\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\nOne thing I will say regarding the atmosphere is that Shoryu does an excellent job of walking the fine line between authentic and fusion. Many of the staff are clearly japanese, but the atmosphere is such that you'll be comfortable even if you're a local or a non-Japanese tourist. Seating is both varied and abundant, so you'll be good whether you're a larger party of just an individual like I was. While the ramen can take a bit of time to come out, know that's because it's made to order, and in the meantime you can dig into a pork bun, which you absolutely should. Star Granted. \nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\nPrices here at Shoryu are comparable to what you'll find elsewhere, with everything inflated just a bit to adjust for currency. Ramen? Twelve pounds. A pork bun? Just shy of a fiver. Considering that these portions are sizable, these are fair prices across the board. Star Granted. \nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\nI went with a mix of traditional and contemporary here at Shoryu, and the result was a classic pork bun and a more modern 'Peri Peri' spicy ramen. I ended up with a bit of a mixed bag, with top notch ramen and a pork bun that was good but not what I would call elite. \nFirst? The pork bun. Good? Again, yes, this was a good pork bun, but I was a bit surprised at the simplicity of the auxiliary ingredients. The lettuce was standard iceberg, and while the pork was good, the entire thing was drowned in a chipotle mayo of some source that cleaned out a lot of the flavor. Good, but not the best I've had (that's you Ippudo). \nNow, the ramen I will say was easily top tier. I have a pretty exceptionally high tolerance for spicy food, so when I was warned that the peri peri ramen was spicy I more or less brushed it off. Wow. A word to the wise? This is some spicy ramen, and when it came down to drinking the broth I had to stop shy of finishing off the whole thing on account of my throat burning with jalapeno seeds. Having said that, the chicken and seaweed and egg and noodles were phenomenal, and this was pretty close to being on par with the best ramen I've had over at Ippudo.  Excellent. Single Star Granted. \nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\nWhile it's not the best ramen and pork bun combo I've ever had, for now Shoryu is the best I've found in the city, and that warrants a fourth star overall. Star Granted."

They say they are recommended by Michelin in different years but I don't seem to find them on the Michelin website. I tried the recommended Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu ramen. I'm so disappointed. The soup is not think, the meat is bland, the egg is bland. They say they marinate the pork and egg for a long time but they don't taste like that. The takoyaki is different from the ordinary ones as they are deep fried. So it's crispy outside. It's \u00a36.9 for 5 pieces but in each one, there's only a tiny piece of octopus. The rest is just dough. It doesn't worth the price. It doesn't worth the wait."

I got the spicy ramen and it was a little spicier than I anticipated but yummy nonetheless. The only thing I'd say I don't like is that the portions are smaller than any other ramen restaurant I've been to and the prices are a tiny bit higher, so the value isn't quite there. Usually, I have difficulty finishing my portion but I probably could've eaten a few more bites after I was done this time.

This place is amazing if you want to try the original ramen and feel the taste of the rich broth they made. \nI've ordered the Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu and was amazing! from the broth to the pork and the noodles were just perfect. You can also choose how you want the noodles to be cooked (from standard to soft to hard). Portion was big enough, staff is nice and friendly, place is not too loud so you can enjoy a chat before and after. This place is also located in a nice spot: not far from Piccadilly circus but not in the heart oh Soho = no queue! That made our Thursday dinner perfect!\nIf I want to be super picky  (as I am,unfortunately) the only cons is: only one toilet for the entire restaurant!You will see people queuing  in front of it which is not great as it is close to the tables so if you are not lucky enough to be close to the bathroom you could end up with people behind you queuing for the loo. \nApart from that, great experience and great food!Will definitely come back soon."

This was my first time here and I ordered the Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu. The tonkotsu broth is nothing to write home about (incredibly bland for boasting that it takes 12 hours to cook), the chashu was flavorless, and the noodles were... well, comparatively similar to everything else that's supposedly good about their ramen. When the ramen was brought out, the broth and egg were cold but the noodles were hot.

    "review": "I've been coming to Shoryu for years so this recent visit was extremely disappointing because I am familiar with their usual level of service and quality of food. \nWhen I was seated I sat there for maybe ten minutes before I had to ask someone for a menu, while other parties were sat after me and given menus right away. These same parties were also given the opportunity to order before I was. I made eye contact with several waiters, signaling that I was ready to order and they ignored me, continuing to chat to each other behind the counter. It wasn't until another ten minutes that I was given the opportunity to order. \nI ordered my usual prawn tempura shoryu bun and a piri piri tonkotsu. When the shoryu bun comes out, there is usually a wrapped wet wipe so that you can clean your hands before you pick up the bun but they didn't give me anything and I had difficulty getting anyone's attention again so I just gave up and ate the bun which tasted great, as usual. When my tonkotsu came out, the nitamago was really overdone to where there was no runny yolk quality, and about 90% of the yolk was a crumbling yellow rather than a silky orange. When I asked for another egg, the waitress asked what was wrong with it and I told her it was overdone and how it's supposed to be soft boiled (I had to explain to her what a proper nitamago looks like while I'm sitting in front of a chalkboard with the definitions of the different elements that make up a ramen, one of which is a definition of a nitamago). She came back with another egg that was still over cooked but better than the my initial egg claiming \"this is the best we've got\".  Other than the egg, the ramen was delicious. \nFinally, when I asked for my check they brought me the bill right away and I sat with my credit card in my hand for maybe 15 minutes before I had to again ask if I could pay. A new waitress came and asked if I wanted to pay by card, and I asked her if the 12.5% service charge could be taken off because out of all the years I've been here I've never experienced such awful service. She just sulked away and came back with an adjusted bill, not once making an attempt to ask why I felt that way or inquire as to what they could do to improve. She merely processed my transaction in complete silence and then walked away. \nI would also like to add that I was not the only one experiencing poor customer service. There was a six-top of Australian diners behind me who asked for water from at least three different waiters and also said they were ready to order, to which the waitress who processed my bill replied in a really harsh and rude tone \"it's coming! I've already asked!\" And another waiter turned up and told them \"you're just going to have to wait!\"\nI usually go to the carnaby branch so maybe it's my mistake for going to a different location but I've been to this location in the past too. I don't think I will return to this branch but look forward to going to another branch soon"

The place on Carnaby St was small, but cozy and pretty lively on a Sunday night. I was seated at the booth and started to chat up with the bartenders. It was my first time, so they explained that they specialize in tonkotsu ramen and went through the pretty large menu with a lot of different ramen options and side dishes. I decided on the Kimchi Seafood tonkotsu because I love spice. I was also able to customize the texture of my ramen (standard, hard, super hard) which I thought was interesting as I have never had that option given to me before. I also got gyoza (because obviously you should get that with every ramen dish) as well as a steamed pork belly bun to start. Also, if you like lychee, definitely try the pink lychee jasmine tea, you won't regret it! \nThe steamed bun came on the mini wooden steamer which I thought was super cute and the pork belly was super flavourful and the bun was also very soft and delicious. The gyoza I absolutely loved!! The crispy layer on the dumping as well as the filling were SO good and not overly salty. I definitely wish I ordered more. The ramen itself was definitely good, but I found the broth to be standard and definitely not as spicy as I wished it to be. It was very mild. I loved that they were very generous on the seafood and I had a lot of it in my ramen. Great sized portion and reasonably priced! \nWhile it wasn't busy, I found the service to be a little slow.

Gosh it was good - garlic, curried soupy goodness with bites sized pieces of friend chicken breast, veg, seaweed and egg floating within. Just perfection. The curry had an almost katsu taste to it which I enjoyed and with the extra clove of garlic, I was in a ramen dream. It was slightly salty but I am a fan of salt so no complaints here! \nService was fantastic and the overall ambience of the restaurant is relaxed and warming.

We finished our ramen and also our beer, and waited long for the gyoza. So we had to ask, and it seems they had forgotten about this order. They apologized and made the food right away when we pointed that out, so it was not the end of the world.

The meat was somewhat flavoursome, but a bit dry and sat awkwardly inside the bun, trying to escape as I bit into it. I don't know, presentation wasn't great and I felt there was little value for money. \nI had the traditional ramen with two lovely half eggs and bits of pork that were ok, but not mind blowingly good as the ones I had in Tokyo. The broth was substantial and nicely flavoured, but I must be honest and said I've had better here in London. The price is honest for what you get, though, and I've heard you can get a second portion of noodles free if you still have lots of broth left.

Had the pleasure of trying their Tantan, Spicy Miso, Piri piri and Curry. Piri piri was my favorite, but it's definitely spicy. Prepare yourselves! The jalapenos give it an extra kick! Tan Tan would be my second fave. The boiled egg is perfectly made every time too! \nDeco is trendy and modern. Service is hospitable and quick. Lucky for us, when we went both times, there wasn't really a wait. Shoryu is right next to Piccadilly, so perfect for a stroll before or after you wine and dine!"

(\u00a37.5)\nThe fried chichen Ramen, is a large portion with several big pieces of Fried chicken (bland) that lost their crispness because of the broth.\nThe broth is flavourful but nothing compared to Ippudo.\nThe 1 star is for the location.\nThe minus 4 stars are basically more for the lack of service i got from the staff.  They are not motivated and not welcoming. I really was about to leave cause i felt i disturbed them. They were several empty seats/table but they offered the one very mext to the main door (bear in mind it is freezing outside and the clients are entering and flgoing out from this door)\nWhen i insisted to get the seat inside that i knew was free they told me no. I was abot to give up but eventually they gave me that seat after mumbling about me.\nThat is how my experience started at shoryu and believe me l, i was still expecting the food to be good despite the attitude of some staff.\nIt is very expensive for nothing and no need to say that i won't recommend it."

I tried multiple types and they all had unique tastes to them that made them worthwhile. \nSome appetizers were tried as well and they had varying degrees of success. The pork belly buns are good but certainly there are better. The brussel spout tempura...uhhhhh not good. Like wow those were pretty bad.\nThe restaurant is also quite small, surprise surprise for a London restaurant and the tables are scrunched together like you can't believe. Surely that made things a little uncomfortable but not until a group of stereotypical 16 year old asian girls with jansport backpacks as if they came straight from a Japanese anime sat right next to us.

    "review": "I recently visited a little gem I frequent on Regent Street, London named Shoryu Ramen. Since its opening in November 2012 they have been offering their Hakata Tonkotsu ramen, a recipe which was specially designed by executive chef, Kanji Furukawa. \nShoryu translates to mean 'to bring good fortune'.\nI find Shoryu to be an understated, modest establishment, however its popularity speaks for itself. You cannot reserve a table ahead of time and frequently I spot a line that reaches way outside into the busy streets of Soho. A ringing endorsement in itself and an indication of quality before you even enter the front door!\nTheir menu is refreshingly simple - as their name suggests, they mainly offer steaming bowls of ramen, amongst other small plates and of course, steamed buns!\nI HAD to try their steamed buns as this delicious creation is one of my latest favourites. For those yet to discover these beauties, a steamed bun - as the name suggests, consists of a variety of fillings, encased in a pillowy, fluffy steamed-dough bun\nI opted to try two different variations, the Char Sui barbecue pork belly (left) and the soy marinated chicken Karaage (right). Now I'm never short of an opinion, but I REFUSE to pick a favourite, they are both unbelievably spot-on. The pork belly was packed with flavour and smothered in charred-sweet sauce, which married well with the crunch of the salad and the softness of the bun, whilst the contrast of the crispiness of the chicken against the cloud-soft bun was to die for!\nYou just simply have to try these, plus they offer more variations on their menu, namely; their ginger salmon Tatsutage, their tiger prawn Tempura, and their vegetarian-friendly, grilled Halloumi & Shimeji mushrooms.\nQuite honestly, after those two delicious helpings of steamed buns - I really couldn't imagine tackling their rich, generous serving of Ramen - I had to give myself a break! \nBut I finally opted for their Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu - their signature 12-hour ramen, but with a richer, meatier broth. \nI loved this dish, it has variety, balance and is the exact antidote to a hectic day, rushing around London. This steaming bowl of warmth allows you to take a much-needed pause.\nOk, I will admit that I had to take half of this serving home to enjoy, however I'd argue that after the flavours were able to muddle for even longer it made for an even more delicious serving. Don't be ashamed to take your ramen on the tube home!\nShoryu Ramen isn't the least expensive establishment you can visit, but its comforting simplicity, packed with flavour keeps me coming back. A would definitely recommend this to anyone who is an Asian-food lover. Or to anyone who has yet to try their first bowl of Ramen or steamed-bun - this is a great place to start!\n...And a tip to any Ramen-lover on a budget - you can take a ramen, steamed-bun and a drink to go for just \u00a312 with their go PACKAGE. \nI've only ever visited their Regent St. location, but why not visit their other restaurants located in Soho, Carnaby and Liverpool Street? Does anyone have a preference? Let me know!\nHappy Slurping!\nSee the original blog here: \nlaurajreeves.com/2015/05\u2026"

The Pork Char Siu came in a fluffy bun with sliced cucumber, lettuce and mayo. I liked it, but wish it had a couple of slices of pork. \nThey have several versions of Tonkotsu Ramen. I chose the Piri Piri which is their spicy version. All the ramen come with the sliced pork, half a soft boiled egg, mushrooms, seaweed, roasted garlic and thin noodle egg ramen. The broth was rich and thick, but to my surprise not very spicy at all. I kind of wanted more heat, so a little disappointed. I didn't see the red pepper anywhere either. But they do have the fresh garlic in a bucket with the crusher, if you choose to want to squeeze some into your ramen, which I did. I did like their noodles as it was thin and chewy. \nThe service was good. And they leave a whole bottle of tap water for you which I thought was convenient. \nFor my ramen and pork bun, it was \u00a318.45 which included what they called a \"12.5 optional service charge\".

There are two Shoryu around Piccadilly Circus, which is a highly touristy area, so I am already a bit suspicious. \nThough a gong is rung every time a customer comes in or goes out of the shop, it doesn't make the place more Japanese. Maybe most of the servers are not Japanese or the restaurant just doesn't have the coziness which is typical of Japanese ramen places. \nI went there for lunch, so I just ordered Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu which is their signature ramen. Anybody who is into ramen knows that the broth is what makes or breaks ramen. Their broth is ok flavor-wise, but nothing really jumped out at me. The toppings include pickled ginger, fried shallots and black wood ear in addition to the usual roasted pork and egg. Overall, it was a good bowl of ramen but that's it. \nShoryu offers a lot of side dishes ranging from sashimi, pork buns to chicken wings, which are not food you would see served at an authentic ramen shop. Call me all fashioned, a good ramen place to me should have just a few options of ramen and limited number of side dishes. Shoryu seems to be a Japanese restaurant that caters mostly to tourists and serves all sorts of Japanese dishes, one of which happens to be  Ramen. If you are looking for great ramen place, I wouldn't recommend it, but if you want some decent Japanese food in the area, this is not a bad choice."

    "review": "Stopped by on a cold London afternoon to some comfort food. The wait staff was very welcoming, walking me through the menu and different options. I ordered their Tonkotsu ramen, gyoza and pork bun. I thought all of the food was very average, but not bad. The tonkotsu broth lacked something, but it was not flavorful enough while the noodles were a bit soft for my taste. Not a bad bowl of ramen but not one that is memorable. The gyoza was presented on a sizzling skillet, very cool. However, the flavor of the gyoza stuffing was also lacking something, perhaps sesame oil? The pork bun used a miso paste of some sort and was my least favorite thing I ordered that day. Okay for a quick bowl if you're craving one but probably not one I would recommend people to go out of their way to get. They do have free wifi."

    "review": "Why is everything in london so expensive... Came to london for a vacation, mid week through our trip of course I start to crave asian food and whats better than a hot bowl of ramen?\nShoryu specializes in tonkotsu soup base which is my favorite.  They have different option for the thickness of the broth.  If you are used to eating ramen def go with the rich broth option as their regular broth was a little on the bland side.  I love the egg as its the perfect yolk consistency.  Service was pretty good also, very fast and attentive.  \nWhile the noodles are pretty good here, it is hard to stomach the fact that I spent almost $100 US dollars here for 2 bowls of ramen, 6pc gyoza and an icecream dessert.  It cost like $30 for a bowl of ramen and $5 to add just an egg...if you are a local then definitely check out this place as their ramen is pretty good but if you are travelling from NY i would say to skip it and save the $."

What makes it surprising is that I was expecting a traditional bao, but in fact it was a mixture of 3 of my favorite infused ethic flavores combined in one bao bun.  Japanese karaage chicken, topped with Korean gochujang sauce and placed between a Chinese style bun. Wowee Bao-ee!! So much flavor bursts exciting my taste buds! Definitely glad I tried that. My Japanese fruit infused mojito and green tea cheesecake for dessert topped it all of to perfection!"

The place was pretty packed for lunch.\nI got a Dracula ramen which is tonkotsu with garlic. Garlic oil, garlic chips, fresh minced garlic, which as one can imagine, gets a pretty strong flavor. Let's just say I wasn't kissing anyone for the whole day or even opening my mouth because I could've killed someone with my breath. Was it worth it? You bet.\nThe broth was rich and flavorful and the flavors melded together for a heavenly experience. The ramen came with half an egg perfectly done and three slices of fatty chashu. What I REALLY enjoyed was that there was some ginger in the broth, which really contrasted well with the garlic. Anyone can throw garlic inside tonkotsu but not everyone can layer flavors like a Korean girl layers clothes. My only grouse is that there was half an egg. Just give me the whole damned egg already. Thank you.\nI haven't written my Bone Daddies review yet but tldr;\nI would choose Shoryu over Bone Daddies. \nI have noticed a distinct difference in the crowds at both places. Shoryu has a more Asian crowd and Bone Daddies seems to have a hipster crowd. Different strokes for different folks."

I'm sure glad I did!\nI came at about 5 PM on a weekday and the place was about half full. I was immediately greeted by the waitstaff and seated at the tables facing the window (one of the perks of dining alone- you can people watch!). Its on Regent Street, smack dab in between Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square so there's plenty of foot traffic going by. \nThe restaurant is somewhat small but has a very modern-style Japanese decor theme. The menu is short and sweet, but they have plenty of varieties of ramen for every taste. I originally leaned towards the curry ramen but ultimately went with the piri-piri ramen after reading peoples' rave reviews. \nI put in my order for a cocktail (only \u00a36 during happy hour!) and ramen, and both were out within 10 minutes. My cocktail -whose name I cannot remember- tasted like a mai tai and was definitely strong... but enjoyable. The ramen came out piping hot with lots of goodies on top of the bed of noodles. The noodles were cooked to the perfect al-dente consistency but I was a little disappointed in the lack of spiciness. Since this is their spicy option, I expected a little more of a kick. There was also a little bit too much lemongrass for my own personal tastes but not so much that it kept me from enjoying my meal. I noticed some reviews remarked on the small serving size but I felt it was the perfect size. I hadn't eaten all day and finished off most of my noodles, and felt more than satisfied. \nOverall, this is a great ramen place if you're in central London. The service was super friendly and attentive. The ramen itself was really tasty and they have all kinds of varieties to try. I definitely think its worth checking out if you get the chance!"

    "review": "As a ramen junkie from NYC, I've been traveling around London's ramen scene to try and find the best bowl here. Shoryu piqued my interest due to the fact that they tout their Hakata roots, which is the region of Japan that tonkotsu ramen is specialized. So I had to come by and try the tonkotsu broth!\nI stopped in around noon and was seated immediately. I ordered the Kotteri Tonkotsu Ramen, a chashu pork bun, and a grilled halloumi and shimeji mushroom bun.\nThe ramen came out first, which was a bit strange, but I started eating. The broth was not as rich as I like my tonkotsu ramen to be. It has what I've complained about most NYC ramen - I call it the \"Ippudo Problem,\" where the tonkotsu broth is the specialty but is not super rich. Tonkotsu broth should be thick, bony, and hearty, but the broth here (which was said to be extra rich) is pretty thin. Also, it was a bit under seasoned, a bit bland. I don't like my broths salty but I do like some flavor in the soup.\nThe noodles here are missing that signature bite that ramen noodles have (even when I ordered it hard), almost just like regular egg noodles.\nYou can thank Momofuku and David Chang for the steamed buns with ramen trend around the world, and the buns here have the same problem that the ones at Momofuku Noodle Bar in NYC does - they are overly sauced with a very strong sauce that masks the flavor of the main ingredient and you basically are eating a bao with sauce and some meat/protein rather than getting a nice complex bite of flavors and textures. It's a shame, because I only really tasted the cucumber because it was not as salty as the rest of it. I actually had to wash it down with the broth (really shows you how bland it was).\nI ordered kaedama and it came out quickly, but they didn't put any tare or sauce on the noodles, so when I put it into the bowl, it watered it down a bit and made it blander.\nOverall, this was a pretty average bowl of ramen. There are many better bowls of ramen in London."

If you've never had this before, and it's a hot summer day, you should definitely give it a chance. Save the hot soup for colder weather.\nNoodles: Very good. Firm and cooked just right. Better than Bone Daddies IMO.\nHiyashi Chuka sauce/tare: A bit to much sweetness, but overall very good.\nTokyo egg: Perfectly cooked. However Bone Daddies tea smoked marinated egg is still one of the best I've ever had anywhere. \nToppings: Menma (bamboo) not bad, needed  more crunch. Tomatoes were not the best - since they're in season now they could have been better. Charsu was a bit to dry, that's why most places use cooked ham typically (there  is no hot soup to soften the chasu). \nNit picking now: Needed a small dab of mustard on the side (pretty standard). And cucumbers should be added too - especially since you're making it in England where they love cucumber too.\nOverall: A great bowl. In Tokyo I'd give it a 3, but for London it's top notch.\nOther stuff: Service was decent, but I find it really weird in London how so many servers don't seem to know squat about the food they're serving. Gyoza were good - and may have been made in house possibly (impressive).\nI will return to try the basic tonkatsu ramen when the weather changes."

Lesson: don't just follow the crowd. \nAs per usual in London, it took a million years for them to take our order of a beer, cocktail, the tan tan ramen and the Dracula ramen. The cocktail, which was just soda and plum wine, wasn't very good. But, the ramens weren't all that bad. The minced pork ramen (\u00a310) was pretty much liquid fire for me, but my boyfriend managed fine. The Dracula ramen (\u00a311.90) had a richer broth that wasn't spicy and was really good when I added some rice vinegar to it.

We've been to Shoryu in Soho before and loved it, so we gave this one a try on a Sunday night (no booking) to see if it was as good as we remembered.\nIt's a packed and busy place, with no room to wait inside, but it was only about 10 minutes before we made it in the door with my parents and grandmother.  I had the Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu - their signature ramen with meatier broth and two eggs, as well as barbecued pork belly, mushrooms, spring onion, sesame, ginger, and seaweed.  Drool.  You can choose how firm you want the noodles too (firm all the way!) and we passed around a few sides of lovely Chicken Karaage - Japanese fried chicken.  It was, as expected, lush, although not the completely glorious closed-eyes experience I remembered from the other Shoryu (I think Japan has ruined me forever).  The broth is just lacking that particular je ne sais quoi that we ate in Asia, but everything else about the dish - noodles, pork, accoutrements, were lovely and craveable.  The fried chicken was very good, with a more delicate batter than you usually get with fried chicken, no bones, and a very hot temperature so watch your tongue!\nA very affordable and delicious place to go for dinner.  Not a bad substitute if you can't make it to Tokyo!"

    "review": "The pork belly buns were flavourfull and yummy; the gyoza had a fresh pork filling that reminded me of homemade (although the skins were not).  I had the original ramen which was a big bowl of miso pork broth with two fatty slices of pork, some seaweed and scallions.  This was good although I did have food envy for my friend's signature ramen (there was half an egg!)  One drawback on the broth was that it was quite greasy.  Defat the broth!  It's not hard to do and really makes for a better, non-greasy experience.  It's not fun having to wipe your lips because it feels like you've put on too much lip balm.\nWhile I liked Shoryu and would go back, the main drawback is the seating.  I think they are trying to provide an authentic, Tokyo experience by making the tables as crowded together as possible.  It is not a place to have any sort of intimate conversation with anyone because you are literally right up against the person sitting next to you.  I get turning tables but Shoryu borders on the ridiculous.  No wonder there were so many solo diners.  You wouldn't want to go here for a friendly chat or first date!"

    "review": "I've now had the chance to return to Shoryu to try more of their menu. In fact, their ever burgeoning menu. I'm impressed quickly they've added dishes to their menu, both in the ramen and the starter/side dishes categories\nThey've also tweaked service slightly. You still get the cheerful Japanese greeting but they've done away with the drum they hit with each new customer\nThey've expanded their ramen menu with both traditional and innovative combinations. I want to love their ramen but can only bring myself to like it. At the risk of sounding ungrateful, I think they put too much in their bowl. I like ramen because I like to taste the ramen noodles but the noodles get lost with all the other parapernalia they put into the bowl\nThey've also greatly expanded their starter/side dish menu. I have to give a shout out to their belly pork hirata buns. These are made up with 2 steamed buns which are quite dense but the perfect foil to the sweet soft pork which they sandwich. I had discovered these at Ippudo in New York and am so glad that I've found somewhere in London which does them\nIf you want a range of dishes, go to Shoryu for their range. However, if you want the best bowl ramen, I'd still recommend Bone Daddies"

    "review": "Me and some friends took advantage of the massive discounts Shoryu was offering and payed the new shop in Piccadilly a visit.   I gotta say in advance that my opinion about the place was not very positive for a good part of the evening but then built up and ended on a good note.  \nWhen we first arrived, we were left outside on a queue waiting to get in with no indication of whether it would take 10 minutes or 1 hour. Not a big deal, but doesn't get anyone any points either. When we finally got a table, we had to wait quite a while to get a menu (which only arrived after us chasing the waiter). 10 minutes later, 2 more people were squeezed in into our table - clearly a management attempt to fit in as many people as possible.  It is fair to say that there wasn't much space left in the table, but that didn't matter as far as the drinks were concerned: 3\u00a3 for the smallest orange juice I've ever seen in my life.  \nThose were the not so good points... but then a storm of flavor arrived and washed that all away.  \nThe starters are really really good, specially the Hirata Buns - the pork ones are spicy but terrific. We also had Soft Shell Crab Tempura which were more than enough for 4 people.  \nThe main Ramen dishes completely met our expectations: flavorful, big portions, good balance between the ingredients. We struggled to finish them after all those starters so it's worth building up your appetite before visiting the place! I had the Tori Kara-Age Men and was quite happy with it - only negative was the size of the fish cake portion: way too small.   We also ordered an extra cold Ramen to try it out. Unfortunately, the waiter brought us the wrong one, so not sure which one it was. \nOverall the service was a bit all over the place and not that well organized, but the staff was friendly and approachable. Can't really give this one a 5 but the food was good enough to stir away from a 3."

(Which is incredible!)\nRamen:\nAny place with tonkotsu broth, I'm going to invariably compare to ippudo. The broth was good to be sure but just not as flavourful as I'd like. It lacks a certain intensity you find in other places.\nNoodles here are pretty nice. Again, not big on flavour but they have a wonderful texture. Definitely Shoryu's USP.\nSides:\nHad gyozas, chicken karaage, and pork buns. All were extremely enjoyable. Pork buns are a must order. \nOverall:\nI'd give the ramen 3.5 stars objectively. In Singapore or New York, I'd say this is an average ramen place. It's a safe choice, enjoyable, but really nothing special. In London though, those same factors mean it's effectively 5 stars. If you're craving ramen, you'll be satisfied."

    "review": "I queued in the snow for nearly an hour... just to eat this ramen.\n(And gyoza and onigiri)\nAND IT RULED.\nAfter we finally got in, we got lucky and secured the only 2 seater table in the place. We were right against the window and had to turn our knees outward as they didn't fit under the table, and I had a fire extinguisher sticking out from the wall behind me. It's definitely a squash in here when it's full so be warned. But unlike Bone Daddies your lack of space doesn't come with uncomfortably loud music and petty portion sizes. So it's even more worth it.\nWe ordered some drinks and a portion of gyoza. They came pretty quickly and were awesome. The gyoza skins were nicely crispy and the perfect thickness.\nThen our ramens arrived. I had the Charsui Tonkotsu for \u00a310 a bowl - which is kind of expensive, but the portion is really generous and it's so good - again this beat Bone Daddies offering. There was lots of broth (GOOD) and the perfect amount of noodles and meat and lots of toppings. The broth was the perfect texture, it had that tonkotsu thickness but wasn't too fatty and greasy. My husband went for the Dracula Tonkotsu, which he loved. It was essentially the richer, garlicy-er version of the normal Tonkotsu and was a dream come true. We asked for vinegar and shichimi powder. They brought a huge metal jug of vinegar and a cute wooden container of shichimi, the waiter was quite funny about the size of the vinegar and the vinegar was really, really good. I love vinegar in my ramen so finding a place that offers it on-menu is a huge plus.\nWhen we saw the specials board we couldn't help ordering a couple of onigiri. They were meant to come with brown rice but as they were running out they asked if we'd mind one with white rice. They were so apologetic and said if we didn't like it with white rice we could have one with brown for free! But for me this was even better as I prefer white rice. They were filled with pickles and really delicious.\nThe onigiri filled us up quite a lot and when we couldn't finish the ramen, we were so happy to find they'd bag everything up in a takeaway bag for us to take home.\nThe service was good, with one minor slip up when a different waiter tried to deliver a second plate of dumplings to us and didn't apologise for the mistake, aside from that it was pretty perfect.\nI love the food here. If it wasn't for the cramped space (sorry, I know it's ramen bar style but I'm still getting used to these packed-in restaurants!) and the fact we had to queue for so long it'd be a 5 star straight away!"

Especially if you are alone.\nThe place is not that big with many small tables and a counter running all over the window. No-nonsense chart, solid ramens, some buns and just a couple of other dishes. But you definitely wanna get the ramen.\nTake the one you prefer, I usually go for the standard one when I want to try a new place (first you show me you can cook a steak, then you can make a filetto alla rossini!), and just stare at the broth: Brown, thick, if I didn't knew it was liquid I'd have said it was a cream! Definitely something special, you can feel that it will be delicious just by looking at it! That my friends is probably the best broth I ever had in my ramen. The egg follows the same description, just absolutely amazing, cooked at the perfection, and overall a real pleasure.\nThe only thing missing, and the reason why it stands below Sasuke in my personal RAMENED competition (Ramen Axelrod May Eat Night & Day) is regarding the thickness of the noodles, which I found a bit too thin for my personal palate. But that's just me being an annoying stickler.\nJust come here and enjoy the delicious broth!"

My Tantan noodles were on the saltier side.  The only thing that annoyed me was that all the minced pork sunk to the bottom of the bowl, and I spent most of my time trying to fish it out. \nI think I'm gonna stick with basic Tonkotsu noodles, where I actually get slices of pork.  \nTo share, we had the Chicken Karaage - same as last time, nicely fried!  We also ordered Gyoza, but for 5, I felt it was quite understuffed and small.  The wrapping was a bit on the hard side.  The pork filling was good, nothing wrong with that.  But I think for the value, I'll stick with just the karaage. \nMy friend ordered the Charsiu Tonkotsu - which is pretty much your classic noodles but with extra pork.  I tasted the broth, and strangely enough, it was... on the sweeter side.  I thought it was just me, but he tasted it too and thought it was definitely sweet.  Anyway, still a nice place to go to, but I think my go-to place is Bone Daddies for now."

    "review": "I've been to Shoryu now twice, once during their soft opening and once afterwards. \nThis place specializes in a a different sort of white soup ramen from a particular region in Japan. Compared to places like Bone Daddies, this is more of an authentic Japanese-style ramen place (but that's not to say that authenticity=better). \nService: When I went during the soft opening, they were definitely still working out the kinks. They have one waitress in particular who we've named 'waitress happy pants' because of her... rather surly demeanor. Quite frankly, I don't know if she was just having a horrible day or what, but I am very forgiving when it comes to bad service, but less so when they are snappy and eye-rolly and seem like they hate their job and everything is the customer's fault (even when it isn't). At any rate, she was actually more hilarious than frustrating, so whatever. \nFood: High soup to noodle content, the soup is flavorful but not quite rich enough for my personal tastes, some nice goodies in the bowl, but not quite enough of them. The ramen noodles themselves were the best thing about this bowl, really good. The first time I got the Shoryu Ramen, which was nice. The second time I had the Tokyo Ramen, which was soy sauce based broth with fish cake and bamboo. I think I prefer the Shoryu because it was one of the specialty white broths. Do order the egg, as they are well seasoned and quite nice (though it is a shame they don't come automatically with a bowl like they do at Tonkotsu and Bone Daddies). My dining partner had the yuzu ramen, which was really tasty. \nWhen I come back, I want to try to spicy miso and the yuzu ones. That said, and this is just personal preference, I found the overall dining experience and food at Bone Daddies to be more satisfying, but it is actually quite hard to compare the two as they are totally different ramen beasts. I'll certainly be back to Shoryu as well, when I want a soupier/less heavy noodle experience."

Was thinking to change this to 4 stars or not after finish eating my bowl of noodle while waiting for my add on side order hakata roll to come.\nReason to add a star:\n1. Ramen still as yummy. I ordered hakata tantan ramen. Nice n spicy. Still loving their chicken kara age.\n2. They change their table n chair to proper table!!\nReason on holding back:\n1. Table was quite oily and sticky. the stuff that I taking up from the table keep sticking on table which make me think about the hygiene of this consider still new ramen shop.\n2. Our sushi didn't come after 20min...... Ask for a waiter to check if they did place the order if they didn't then is ok we ready to pay. He went to check n come back telling us ok Cancelled now!! -_-!!\nOkay....... \n2013\nHave been looking for an authentic japanese ramen shop for quite some time. Heard bout this restaurant for quite some time and finally we get to try it.\nWhen there around 8pm on a weekday with my friend. No queue. Got seated once we were there. Their table and chair seems to be slightly lower. The chair is like those low bar chair kind.......Not comfortable type. Clearly they do not want their customer to be too comfortable and stay too long in their restaurant.\nThe day we went we they were giving out free sake for customer. I ordered their house special bone soup roast pork ramen (I think it call tongkotsu). It was yummy. I like it.  We also order 2 sides fried chicken and the green bean edamame. They serve the bean with brown colour rock salt which make it look special. They do give a free side which is vinegar cabbage.\nWould give a 4 stars if they have more spacious space and comfy seating for  what the price they are charging their customer."

I eventually decided not to do it because I didn't want my biological kids trying to find me 30 years later during their \"finding myself stage\" to figure out what genetic similarities we shared.

We went on the soft-opening week which meant the line was even longer although props to the staff for shoving us in as fast as possible and having no qualms about asking random people to sit together.  However, I didn't quite understand why they split the group up when the table the first pair was given was more than enough for all of us. We swapped the randoms for our friends and everyone was happy (except for the waitress who looked like she was about to punch a hole in the wall).\nThe Ramen itself was good (I chose the Shoryu Special) with a rich creamy white broth that was an excellent argument on its own for taking the slow boil method for making tonkotsu stock. The pork itself wasn't that flavourful and I remember being a little disappointed in the low amount of veggies. Those that were there were excellent and so was the egg. The bowl is a massive serving and I happily slurped my way into fatty pork nirvana.\nIt's a bit cramped inside with the planners seemingly hell bent on working out how to maximise the number of people per square meter. Be prepared to get close to some strangers and even cosier with your friends. Then again, we all survive the tube in rush hour so by comparison this is downright luxurious! \nIn the London Ramen rankings, the overall food is good but not enough to dethrone Bone Daddies as the London Ramen King!"

I was seated quickly, and ordered the \u00a39.9 Takana Tonkotsu with a \u00a33 side of menma and \u00a31.5 of egg, as well as the \u00a36 shishito peppers.  Nice but quite expensive additions.  5 minutes later (I do appreciate the fast service here, way faster than Bone Daddy's), I had a hot steaming bowl of ramen.  They're not stingy with the portion either.\nThe noodles were al dente and the broth was certainly flavorful, but missing the fattiness that I prefer.  In fact, it was a bit watery. I preferred the pork at BD as it was softer and fattier.  \nUpdate: I came here again, and ordered the Wasabi Tonkotsu and Karaka Miso Buta Tonkotsu.

The broth here is great, therefore the ramen is great.\nI had the char siu ramen - the original ramen plus extra pork, and my wife had the Dracula ramen, which had caramelised garlic. I got to try her broth at the end: it was garlicky indeed, but still very nice. Noodles were cooked just right and the pork slices were nice. As you would expect, mine had a lot of pork slices which were a treat. An unusual element was the pickled ginger. It's a surprise when you eat it, but makes for a good occasional contrast to the rest of the ramen.\nWe got our usual sides of karaage chicken and gyoza. The gyoza came with a nice ginger dipping sauce. The karaage chicken was made from chicken breast, which was ok but I have noticed that the thigh meat has more flavour and is juicier.\nWe got an Asahi each too. They came with a half pint glass of the sort you would find in an English pub, which I liked.\nOur total bill came to \u00a348 with service.  This is about average or just under for the ramen places that we have visited in London. I would come back here, but probably just for the ramen.\nThe place is an easy walk, just down the hill, from Picadilly tube station.  There was a small queue outside when we got there at around 6:30pm and this grew during the evening.  This is something to bear in mind - however, ramen appears to be one of the trendy things at the moment, so most good ramen places would be like this."

    "review": "If you're wondering about that wasabi tonkotsu, I too was curious before finally coming here on Sunday.. I had checked out their ramen selection in advance to see what they had to offer compared to the other ramen joints..and wasabi ramen is definitely a new one for me.\n \nSo I will start with the con. They have a scoop of pasty wasabi shavings when your bowl is brought out untouched, along with the atypical bean sprouts, earwigs, pork, and two sheets of seaweed (sorry, gotta pay extra for an egg!). The pasty wasabi shaving was not very potent, especially when I mixed it in with my broth. The beauty of wasabi is that spicy zing shooting up one's nose with every bite, and I had imagined every bite of this ramen would do me the same justice; on the contrary, it was very subtle. I have seen broth prepared with wasabi oil to give it a strong kick but this broth is not wasabi flavored and the only thing giving it the wasabi love was the scoop of wasabi bits on top of the noodles. Don't get me wrong, the broth was excellent, very milky and not overtly salty.. but just wasn't what I was expecting when ordering wasabi tonkotsu. While there's no doubt you can make out the faint taste of wasabi, the taste was too repressed for me. Don't lie to yourself and say you've ever gone for wasabi wishing it were only a faint kick! In my opinion, if the depth of wasabi flavor is not there, it really is just another bowl of tonkotsu ramen, with a hint of wasabi. I told the waitress who said she'd convey it to the chef, so maybe there will be a slight change next time?\nOn the other hand, the ramen had veerry good noodles. I am a big fan of thin straight ramen noodles (as opposed to curly or flat ones). These were straight, firm, and a little chewy, which to me is an example of well-made ramen noodles. It's always easy to make it too soggy and I don't enjoy it when it's bordering that opaque look, but as I said, these were firm chewy tender noodles with great flavor. They were very yellow too, so these were probably made with a higher egg content, giving it that yellow hue and flavor that reminds me of Chinese egg noodles (but with nicer texture). Another pro was that the egg was pretty delicious as well. It's no \"dayum..dayum..DAYUM\" (see review on Bone Daddies on my usage of the Dayum scale) but still great execution. It was not as runny as I would like it but it wasn't overcooked and you can still see the soft, creamy, orangey glow in the middle. So the main difference was that it wasn't as beautifully runny like Bone Daddies' egg, but to me it was marinated to perfection and not overly salty as Bone Daddies' eggs. The same goes for the pork. They were not overwhelming large slices; in fact, I usually save the pork for the end and when I reached the end, in hindsight, I think I only got one slice total? It was either one slice or one and a half slices. Not the most protein one could wish for but it was tasty. And I was too busy wolfing down my noodles anyways. \nLastly, Shoryu Ramen doesn't have a bar area for one-person parties (is it a party if there's only one person :( ?). I always think ramen joints should keep with tradition to have single seats, for those who want to sidle in for a quick eat. That's the true beauty of eating ramen like fast-food as they do in Japan! Instead, they have a couple of small tables, and a long booth seat along the wall with small tables to section parties off. Meh, guess I'll just have to find some friends to come with!"

I've ordered the Tokyo Shoryu.  The broth was fine, the noodles tasted rather good and he toppings were OK, just your typical japanese inspired out-of-the-tin vegetables with meat. Soft shell crab was rather soggy, but I wasn't expecting any miracles here.\nWhat was excruciatingly horrible was the service. \nYes, we turned up late and our food was late. However when I discovered a hair in my food I got extremely upset by the fact that no one had the courage to come to me and apologise/offer a refund as they usually do in such places. I hadn't touched more than half of my food and no response - extremely unprofessional and definitely not what one would expect from such a central London location. \nI saw the floor manager who was only able to offer an apology and had the service charge taken - something that I found rather disrespectful for both the staff and I as the service was generally good.\nI don't know if I'd go back - possibly I'd try the other branch but this place needs to invest more on customer care."

Something that stood out to me and I just have to mention it, is that they have a heat lamp for all of us eager ramen-craving freezing patrons right outside of the entrance. How thoughtful :) \nWe started with the pork belly hirata buns. The bread was fluffy and the meat was tender, delicious. A little bit of spiciness, which was unexpected but tolerable enough for a spice-wimp like me. Then came the main event. I had the Tokyo Shoyu and it was amazing. The broth was full of flavour and the pork, veggies & noodles were all delectable. The portion was enormous and I was fully stuffed and satisfied at the end of the meal. Great place!"

We weren't planning on getting any buns, but it happened to be 2-for-1 bun night. We ordered two bowls of ramen and two pork belly buns. \nThe ramen came out hot and flavorful, very large portions. The buns were a good size and very good. If we ever visit London again, I would definitely come back and I would order more buns and share a bowl of ramen."

It's a small little shop in one of the busiest spots of London, which means you might hit a queue. I was pretty lucky at noon on a weekend and we only waited about 10 min but by the time we left, the wait looked considerably longer. \nThere seems to be a lot of ramen popping up around town, if you're on the hunt to compare, put Shoryu on your shortlist."

I asked what the most popular dish was and the waitress told me the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu. I absolutely LOVED it! At first I was confused on why I didn't have any Chashyu, and then I realized that I had gotten \"pan fried minced pork\" this was so much more delicious than the chashyu (pork slices). The meat was very juicy, a little bit too salty, but I liked it that way. There was a good portion of noodles and the bowl was quite large. I also liked the spicyness of the ramen dish!\nIf I lived in London, I would eat here as often as I could! I think the price is very reasonable and there are a bunch of side dishes that you can get as well. The place was quite upscale looking and super clean!"

However, ramen in Japan is a serious topic, can be the theme for life. \nI think it could earn four stars as the quality of food was great overall, but the bean sprout tasted old, kinda sourly almost people from FSA will question about its freshness.

Shoryu satisfies all my cravings and it amazing!\nComing from New York, I have a pretty high standard for ramen (at least I would like to think so), so once I moved here, I had to find here I could feast on delicious pork belly and noodles. After reading a bunch of reviews I tried a few places out, and so far Shoryu is my favorite. I've been back a few times since finding it too. Each time I come hungry because the bowls are massive! And of course I have to save room for the fantastic hirata pork buns!\nThe place is relatively small and cramped, but that's London for small restaurants. It is still very nice and the atmosphere is great. Servers greet you when you come in and the servers are always nice and efficient. \nIf you need a dose of ramen in your life check this place out. I have gone with native Chinese and Japanese friends and they give their stamp of approval too! \nThe broth is always salty and deliciously umami-like, the meet is tender, and the noodles don't lose their sogginess after ten minutes in the bowl, which is nice. \nGo, feast, enjoy, return."

I even took it so far as collecting business cards from all the shops and making a binder with notes on each.  Of course, you have to judge Ramen outside Japan with a slightly relaxed standard, because it's hard to replicate the full environment.\nThat said, Shoryu is a solid bowl of noodles.  Tonkotsu is my favorite variety of Ramen, and these guys get it right.  The soup is thick and fragrant and the noodles have the right amount of chewiness.  I only go to London a few times per year, but Shoryu is definitely on my must-go list from now on."

Love love loooove.\nWhen I first entered the restaurant, gongs were sounded based by the number of people you have in your party. *so honoured* Then we were sat, and a complimentary small saucer filled with cold yet crunchy cabbage(?) is served. \nFor my first time here I ordered the Dracula ramen. It is one of the newer food options and it's delicious! Definitely gives you garlic breath after to ward off the vampires later on, but who cares? Great food requires great sacrifices. \nSecond time was Yuzu ramen for me. Might feel weird at first glance because yuzu is a citrus fruit, but when mixed with the salty tonkotsu base, it is actually something quite sensational. Not one of my favourites, but my impression of Shoryu is still higher than ever. \nLove the ambience here as well - although everyone is sat pretty close, it's not too noisy and the lighting and overall decoration and furniture makes it a good mix of classy and cosy. \nThe service here is amazing - I can tell that they try to emulate the Japanese service here, and that makes it so welcoming to me. \nPrice-wise is reasonable in comparison to other ramen restaurants in London. Shoryu definitely wins in the value-for-money department. \nWill come back again and again and again. I'll never be bored of ramen."

Ramen is pretty much tailor made for miserable London winters and as the days get progressively greyer and grimmer, I'll be making a beeline for Shoryu. You should too. The noodles are fresh and bountiful (perhaps a little too bountiful but there are worse problems to have, hey), the broth rich and flavoursome and the meat and veggies seasoned to perfection. The gyoza is also pretty great, but there's no way you'll have space for it after the ramen. Honestly, if I didn't you won't. On top of this, the setup is really nice and cosy and does away with the canteen style feel that often comes with ramen spots. I'll be back."

Pork belly was ok - doesn't quite melt in your mouth and of course you couldnt go wrong with the mayo. Mmmm. I also tried the gluten free hirata bun and they microwaved it!! So the ends ended up being very hard. But where I could chew it was actually tasty and the texture quite good - not as soft and pillowy but decent and tasty! If you are going for the gf hirata buns (which only comes in chicken), ask them not to microwave but to steam it.  The matcha tea was absolutely disappointing.

    "review": "Let me start by saying I am Japanese, spent the first 18 years of my life there, and have spent the last 25 in New York City, where there is plenty of and an increasing amount of ramen competition, that most ramen connoisseurs would be proud of.  I adore ramen, and am comfortable claiming myself as a connoisseur.\nI am not trying to be racist, but there is a non-Japanese manager at Shoryu, who does not understand how ramen is properly consumed.  I ordered the most simple combination of a bowl of ramen and an order of gyoza.  As any seasoned ramen eater knows, each of those dishes are good on their own, but eating them together is what makes the experience whole.  Well  I received my gyoza within 5 minutes of ordering (great), but did not receive my ramen for another half hour (not great).  Given the standard ritual, I of course held off on eating my gyoza until the ramen came, and by then, it was cold, greasy, and to be honest, slimy.\nNow the ramen.  The soup (I had the piri piri tonkotsu) was not bad.  The noodles felt and tasted a bit like soba noodles, i.e. too straight, and too hard.  And worst of all, they make the same mistake that so many foreign ramen outposts do - they pile on the vegetables and other stuff, taking away from the taste of the ramen itself, perhaps to fool you into thinking you're getting a good bang for your buck.  True ramen, as most know, shouldn't be adulterated by too much \"gu\" , so you can let your tastebuds focus on and appreciate the simple noodle and soup combination.\nWhen I complained to said manager about the half hour gap between the gyoza and ramen, she simply said sorry, and quickly stuck another customer in front of me - they make you share tables, so as not to slow down business.  So those of you who feel weird about eating at a small table for two with a perfect stranger sitting eighteen inches in front of you, maybe you should venture elsewhere.  Very different from sitting next to someone at a counter, even though you are just as close.\nWith very mediocre ramen and horrible service, I will continue to wait for the awesome ramen shop this city so desperately needs."

    "review": "Our Monday night experience at Nobu was MEH and only made it to A-OK thanks to attentive staff and management. The food alone would NOT have made it to A-OK. \nGoing to Nobu for her birthday after the completion of The Championship (aka Wimbledon for folks that are not interested in tennis) is our friend's tradition. So we looked forward some treats. All three of us love sashimi, but for variety, we thought the seasonal tasting menu would be a good idea. Wrong! The tasting menu was MEH at best. I rarely had worse. And it is hard to get less value (\u00a3100 per person). The tapas size dishes were generally over-sauced. On the seafood starter plate had salmon, but - in my opinion - salmon doesn't belong on a sushi/sashimi plate (unless you are feeding kids that are afraid of raw seafood). The marinated hamachi was one of the few enjoyable bites. It would have been better without the marinade as I like to taste the ingredients. Do not get me wrong. We all love spice and spicy dishes. I mean extreme spicy as long as the spice doesn't cover the ingredients' taste. Here Nobu generally failed. It got worse with their Wagyu course. No idea where that old cow came from. There was no sign of tender fattiness that Wagyu is famous for. Just pieces that remind one of shoe leather: both in texture and taste (and I am only exaggerating slightly). It was time for a call to management. They actually brought us a replacement dish. A Peruvian  style beef dish that was simmered rather than fried. It wasn't a great dish either, but the cooking method seemed to be more compatible with the beef they offered. The spice - a sauce that tasted a lot like tabasco from a bottle - didn't really agree with beef. The manager said that it is a traditional Peruvian spice. If true, I conclude that I do not like Peruvian spice. \nFrustrated with the food so far, we ordered a few pieces of sashimi and finally Nobu didn't mess up. Mackerel and o-toro were excellent. The scallops might be good for the location, but living in New England spoiled us, and therefore cannot win awards. The razor clams were out. Otherwise, the fish choices seemed pedestrian. Mackerel and o-toro are the winners. \nOn the beverage side, I asked about their Daiginjo. Our waitress said that the Daiginjo is very bland and she recommended one of their other dry sakes, Onigoroshi (at half-price). As I was hesitating, she offered to bring us two cups to try. The recommended sake was not bad, but had too many strong flavors with a hint of a bitter, chemical aftertaste. We stuck to the Daiginjo and were very happy after three large carafes for three people. The standard Nobu Daiginjo has a typical, clean, delicate Niigata flavor. Definitely done right! May be too delicate vor the Peruvian side of the restaurant. \nEventually we made it to dessert, which was pleasant and covered some of the earlier pains. Picture to follow ..."

Prior to entering the restaurant, you can give your coats and bags to the cloakroom and then go up the stairs to the main restaurant. \nWhen we sat down we were given a choice of still or sparkling water (however I would've just gone with tap but I felt too shy to say at the time) and given a drinks and food menu. \nTo drink, I ordered a summer breeze cocktail (vodka, prosecco, raspberries and soda) which was really light and refreshing whilst my boyfriend ordered a virgin Mojito. The cocktails came fairly quickly and were really good! \nWhen ordering we had a few bits that had caught our eye, however I asked the waitress her opinion. She was very knowledgeable and when she saw that we were ordering two dishes which had various tempura bits in, she said that she would arrange for them to arrive at separate times which was nice of her. \nWe ordered the Chicken with Teriyaki Sauce and Tempura which came with salad, rice and miso soup and that was delicious!! The chicken was extremely tender and the sauce was sweet and not too sticky or dry. \nWe also had the octopus jalape\u00f1o which was slices of cold octopus in a jalape\u00f1o sauce. I thought that it was different but I liked it. Very tasty. \nNext there was Lobster Tempura with a Creamy Wasabi sauce and that was absolutely divine! The creamy wasabi sauce complimented the lobster and wasn't over powering. Definitely my favourite dish so far. \nWe couldn't go to Nobu without having sushi so we ordered the California with Crab & Avocado Inside Out cut roll and it was really tasty. I've never had crab sushi before but it was great. \nFor pudding we shared a Chocolate Bento Box which had a flourless chocolate fondant with almond ice cream. The menu stipulated green tea ice cream but I asked if we could change it and the waitress was happy to oblige. It was delicious but very rich. In hindsight I should have ordered something fruitier! \nOverall Nobu was great.

Not so in London's Nobu. As a matter of fact it was disappointing from soup to nuts, from hello to goodbye.\nWe arrived, having a confirmed reservation, and well, I found the host a bit off putting and snooty, like he was quite bothered by having to work at all. That was the welcome but I was determined to put that behind us and enjoy the food. The dining room was very noisy and to be honest I can't say too much for the very plain decor which for having the upscale market clientele did not fit. The service too was very sub par. Our waitress really didn't know the menu and when asked questions had to go ask someone else and come back to relay the information, it all just felt 2nd rate. \nThe food too was just OK. Some of our sushi rolls were very basic and uninteresting. Perhaps had we had a waitress who could have made suggestions it might have helped with our selections. We did know our sushi but it might have helped to have tried more of the house specials, that sort of thing. It was all just bland and unexciting. Not to mention the noise in the dining room made it very hard to converse at the table. I was quite ready to leave which is a shame because we were very much looking forward to dining there. \nTo end the whole night out, a quick stop at the toilets resulted in a trek down a back staircase that felt like I was in the back of a nightclub. And the toilets themselves looked like they were from a nightclub. It really highlighted the fact that Nobu is way past its prime. We left looking for someplace else to have dessert."

Much too sweet and hard to stomach\n- Toro sashimi: 3/5 the tuna didn't taste like very fresh/high quality fish\n- Tuna avocado roll: 4/5 eh, very plain but that's just your run of the mill tuna avo roll\n- Edamame: 5/5 hard to mess up\n- Sea urchin crispy nori sushi cup: 2/5 I'm usually a big fan of sea urchin but the crispy nori sushi cup felt like burnt/tasteless/cardboard seaweed and it didn't complement the flavour of the sea urchin at all!\n- Chocolate bento box: 4/5 pretty standard chocolate fondant and the green tea ice cream was also ok\nThe service was really good, our waitress was very attentive, but I would personally never come back here again, especially considering the price for what you get."

    "review": "Excellent food, as you'd come to expect from any Nobu establishment. All the usual favorites are here, including new-style sashimi, crispy rice with sushi, miso black cod, and creamy spicy shrimp. Although not very authentic, all our dishes were fresh and delicious, and presented excellently as well. \nService is decently friendly, if a bit unorganized at times (probably due to the fact that you don't have a dedicated server) - we asked to keep a menu for perusing main courses after ordering some appetizers, only to have it whisked away by a passing waiter. Waters were refilled frequently, and new cups of green teas were brought out as soon as the previous ones were finished. \nDecor leans towards the modern; lots of wood and decent lighting. I do wish they would eliminate the irasshaimase that all the staff shout out at arriving guests - it gets annoying pretty quick, and they all botch the pronunciation anyways."

We had been meaning to try this Nobu but had not got round to it.  On arrival we were greeted by a cloakroom attendant who checked in our belongings then we moved onto the restaurant.  The staff were always polite, courteous and very helpful.  I felt for the reputation of the restaurant and location the interior decor felt a bit basic however I tried not to be off put by this.\nOnce seated we asked the waitress to suggest a selection of dishes whilst also highlighting certain ones we wanted to try.  Her opinions were very helpful and honest and I would say her choices helped make our meal very enjoyable.  We ordered octopus jalape\u00f1o, lobster tempura, chicken teriyaki, Californian crab sushi rolls and cocktails.  \nThe waitress assessed our order and suggested the order with in which for our food to arrive at our table to maximise the dining experience, which it did.\nThe octopus was very nice however the pieces could of been slightly bigger.  The chicken teriyaki was very good as was the sushi.  However the absolute favourite was the lobster tempura.  It was amazing, although pricey it is well worth the cost and I would of been happy just having that, a man with simple yet expensive taste!\nOnce we had tackled the main and starters we shared a dessert bento box, again with staff accommodating the changes we requested, which in this case was a change of ice cream flavour.  \nOverall the dining experience was amazing, well worth it but I would suggest for a special occasion as it is very pricey.  The food is splendid, the staff superb and I would say it is one of my favourite meals I have had.  What are you waiting for, go to Nobu!"

    "review": "Before reviewing Nobu, I should note that I have been to Japan and eaten fresh sushi there.\nThat being said, Nobu is likely the best sushi you can have in London. Our party arrived on time and we were promptly seated. The staff checked our coats and took us to our table. The locale is very trendy with some great lighting centered just above the table. Great for taking photos of your food! Also people watching as you'll see all walks of life inside.\nI expected the sushi to be the highlight of my dining experience here but instead it was the appetizers, notably the sushi tacos, the baby tiger shrimp tempura, and best of all--the roasted padron peppers. Each order of sushi tacos brings just one delightful little boat with some salted sushi and tasty salsa sauce to go with it. The taco was great with a nice buttery flavor. The baby tiger shrimp tempura stole the show. They were just perfectly fried with a non-excessive helping of creamy spicy sauce. And you'll think I'm crazy for saying this but the shrimp was laid out on the freshest bed of arugula (or rocket, for the Brits) that I've ever had. So fresh that my friend and I finished up all the tasty greens after we finished the shrimp.\nI was surprised to see the padron peppers on the menu instead of shiso (I suspect they may be the same). These playful peppers are known for their random distribution of spicy. Most of the peppers are not, but occasionally you'll get a really hot one and you won't figure out until you take a bite. These were roasted to perfection and quickly devoured by the members of our party. If these are on the menu (I believe they were a special that night) I suggest you try them. Their taste is pepper-y but distinctly different. More savory than sweet and rarely found in restaurants.\nThe drinks menu is nice an extensive with some traditional offerings plus a lot of nice Japan-inspired drinks involving sake, plum wine, lychee liquor, and shiso pepper leaves. I was between a bourbon based drink and the japanese margarita and ultimately went for the latter  which contained red chili infused sake in addition to your margarita fixings. There's a great number of non-alcoholic juice-based options if that is more your style. The lychee beverage was just sweet enough and definitely a nice alternative for those nights you really don't want to spike that alcohol level.\nFinally, the sushi. The sushi tacos had some of that lovely raw fish served at Nobu but were overpowered by the salsa and taco. The real show is with the sashimi. You order your individual piece and they'll bring them out in a grand serving plate. You get your choice of different tunas--all of which are fantastic and fresh. I had a lovely dining experience with the exception of a couple sashimis whose rice beds fell apart. These were dabbed on the underside with just the right amount of wasabi. Although if you like some more you'll have some of that as well at your table.\nUltimately this was a positive experience albeit over priced. This is likely a combination of Nobu being a trendy London restaurant and the steep prices for decent fresh fish in an inland city. As mentioned before, the show stealers were really the tempura shrimp and the padron peppers rather than the raw fish.  At the end of the day, the reality is that I had a more satisfying sushi experience at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Tokyo than I did at the great Nobu in London. I loved the arugula and padron peppers, but is that really what you should take away from this experience? Just not worth the price tag."

I was excited to finally go. Then I went to the wrong Nobu. I went to the flagship store on Berkley Street only to realized that my deal was at a different location on Park Lane. When I finally arrived at the restaurant, I was disappointed, as it looked quite plain and we even only had those one time use chopsticks. \nI ignored it all, as I was anticipating a great meal. Then it turned out to be a very OK experience. The four course we had were sashimi starter, assortment of sushi, tempura and then chicken with Teriyaki Sauce. I was expecting a lot more from Nobu, or at least a little twist or something different. If these were the dishes I want to eat, I would have gone to a local Japanese restaurant. I felt it was totally pedestrian. I understand that usually restaurants don't tend to put their best dishes in set menu deals, but come one, maybe just one awesome dish to make me want to come back and try the regular menu. Now, I have totally no desire of returning."

    "review": "\"Good evening and welcome to Nobu London...\" Yeah, right! I didn't feel welcome at all.\nAt Nobu London you can reserve a table, but for a maximum of two hours. This is the new generation of fast food. Literally.\n\"Would you like some *something unintelligible*?\" Some what? \"Oh, you haven't been here before. Eh, what do you usually like to eat?\" My sister says that she likes spring rolls and tempura maki. \"Nice, something more?\" We actually have to ask if it's possible to wait for the last one (me, I came a few minutes late) before ordering, and maybe have a look at the menu.\nWhen I arrive they start filling up our glasses with water. That we pay for. You take one sip and they're all over you filling up your glass again. And again. And again. \"Do you want another one?\"\nSo, food then. We decide to order a wide range of sushi, meat, green beans and spring rolls to share. After giving our order she suggests ordering a main meal for each of us as well, because it won't be enough. We have to convince her that we'll start with this, and then see.\nOrdering a couple of beers and a coke as well. Beer is thrown into the glass with no control, I've rarely seen that much foam. And they continue filling up all the time. Just to get rid of it. So we can order some more.\nAnd now the food starts arriving. First some sushi. At least the food isn't the worst I've ever tasted. That's something. Moving the last piece of sushi from the plate, and they're all over us again removing the plate. It happens again, and again. They even ask if they could take out those we haven't finished yet.\nWe're kinda wondering if this is a comedy show with hidden cameras. At least not a restaurant where you have to pay \u00a33.50 for rice in an espresso cup, and where a dinner for three adults and a child, without starters or dessert, costs \u00a3160. Remember that we ordered little food. Yet we were all satisfied. We would like to have some dessert, though. But not here.\nPaying was an exciting process. Just by putting the credit card at the table we got the bill, and seconds later the payment machine. \"Insert your card here, please\". We had to persuade her to let us look at the bill first. No option whether you wanted to pay the service charge or not, even though the bill stated this opportunity.\nBefore leaving for dessert at Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 I had to go to the toilet. Straight forward, to the right, in through some doors who made me wonder if I was heading toward a submarine or space ship. Then down some stairs and through a couple of corridors. Oh, there it is! If you're a man at least, women has a few more stairs to take.\nAfter doing what I had to, I went to wash my hands (of course). Oh, another Nobu-employee. Thanks for showing me how to turn on the water, I wouldn't find out myself. Yeah, I know how soap dispensers works as well, thanks dude. And even before I got the soap off my hands he stood there with the towel up in my face. If I want another one? Does it look like I would need another one. Don't think so. And then you want money? Here is a pound, hope you're happy!\nSo... finding my way back is the next mission. I wasn't aware that I came here for a labyrinth adventure, but that's how it turned out. After taking some stairs, I try a door. Oh, hi dude. \"This is wrong way\" We take one more stair before trying again. Old flowers, meeting rooms and an elevator. Guess it's wrong again. After walking up and down the stairs trying some doors we found our way out of the labyrinth.\nFinally out of this place we're heading down the street for a dessert at Hard Rock Caf\u00e9. At least we're welcome and we can even sit as long as we want.\nSpare your time, money and irritation. You're not welcome at Nobu anyway."

Honestly, if I had gone here a few years ago when good food in London was hard to fine, I would have left this dinner with a full stomach and huge smile on my face despite the bill. My 3 star rating here isn't' because the food is bad - because let's be honest, great sushi isn't easy to find in London, but because the value just simple isn't there.  I wish I could say I wasn't disappointed but we left Nobu full on tempura, delicious sushi, dessert, cocktails, saki and a 200 quid bill and I couldn't help thinking of all the other places we could have gone and left just as satisfied for half the price.  \nWe decided to go to Old Park Lane as it was easier to get a last minute reservation (so no, not Berkley Square!).  Though Nobu is indeed right next to the Park, the view isn't what you would want or expect given the status of the restaurant and I was disappointed during a visit to the ladies' room to see how old and not-charming the walk down the stars was. These may seem like petty things to point out, but when you're paying top notch for dinner (and with comparable places now in London) this just didn't do it for me.\nSorry, Nobu. Maybe I'll like you better in NYC."

    "review": "An overall solid performance, with just 2 complaints to make.\nFor lunch with I had a single piece of o-toro tuna sushi, the new style salmon sashimi, and a beef katsu donburi. For all this and a glass of iced green tea I payed 60 pounds.\nThe o-toro sushi was fantastic. The quality of the fish was exquisite, and the rice was just perfect, bringing such an amazing amount of flavour which, instead of masking the flavour of the tuna, enhanced it. There was no need to add any wasabi in my opinion as the right amount was already added by the chef. Even the ginger and fresh wasabi which accompanied the sushi was of very high quality. 10/10\nNobu's new style sashimi is, simply put, Japanese style carpaccio. The sashimi is arranged on a plate with shaved ginger, sesame seeds, and finely chopped scallions. It's then drizzled with soy sauce, and I believe sesame oil and some yuzu or lemon juice, which gives it a sour/tart flavour. Heated olive oil is also drizzled over the sashimi to cook it slightly, altering it's texture and flavour slightly. I thought this dish was great, except the dish was a bit too sour, overpowering the other flavours and unbalancing the dish, making it hard to discern the taste of the fish, or even the other components of the dish. A little less acidity would go a long way. 7/10\nThe main course course was the beef katsu donburi, which is a thin breaded beef steak about an inch thick, fried first in oil, the finished in a separate pan with a broth mixture where a beaten egg mixture is added towards the end of cooking such that it almost wraps around the beef. It's served over a bed of rice. It was delicious. The beef and the egg mixture had taken on the taste of the savoury, slightly sweet flavour of the broth, complementing it beautifully with it's own. The rice was also perfectly cooked and was lightly coated in the thick broth as well. Unfortunately the beef was overcooked to 'well done', which was a shame as it dried out the beef. It was explained to me before that they're unable to cook it medium-rare as it's quite thin, however I was expecting it medium or medium-well at most, rather than the well-done and dry state that it came. Although the flavours were fantastic and the rest of the dish was damn near perfect, the main component of the dish being dry and overcooked greatly detracted from the dish. 7/10.\nAlthough the raw ingredients used here, especially in the sushi/sashimi dishes, are of an extremely high quality, the execution of the dishes was a let down. New style sashimi is an interesting idea, but the dish was too tart to be something truly memorable, and the overcooking of the beef in an otherwise wonderful donburi is almost criminal. A good meal, but not great, which is what Nobu should be."

Other people asked, and were TURNED DOWN.  I'm not even kidding you here - \"oh no sir, you don't need a plate.\"  \nAs soon as the sharers finished, their plates and chopsticks were whisked away.

( we can talk about dirty martinis later). \nHere's where I do find fault: while the service was excellent - despite the fact that the place was very busy - management has devised a clever way to add $10 to the bill. They initially offer water and immediately open and provide bottled water. Add that to the bill and the \"optional\" 15 percent tip and VAT, well you take my point, a fairly substantial bill (worth it) becomes one $13 plus dollars higher. \nSo, if you eat here, and you should, have an extra martini and say: tap water please. You can always drink water at the hotel or at home. You will survive and be happier in the long run. \nThat said, back home soon to barbecue and bourbon but I do sound fancier when I'm in London."

    "review": "Their raw food's excellent, the rest is only so-so.\nCame here for lunch on a Sunday and the first things that struck me was the number of children under the age of 10. They ordered the \u00a342 miso black cod without thinking twice and knew the menu by heart. Unreal.\nThe decor's quite minimal with a few japanese flower arrangements on the larger tables and while not unpleasant, having heard so much about this place I thought it'd be grander. Similarly, service could've been better. Given the number of wait staff walking around, nothing much seemed to be happening. They check all the boxes in terms of refilling your glass, taking your order, but something's still lacking--personality. It all seemed quite mechanical, like you'd expect at a chain (which I guess this is).\nIt took quite a while for the food to arrive but the sushi was definitely worth the wait. Very fresh, great selection. The negi toro cut roll was superb and the seaweed was crispy. The scallop sushi was sweet and smooth and they were huge! The mackerel sushi was also really good--oily with some bite. You get two thin slices on the rice instead of one thick slice, which is much more enjoyable texture-wise. We also ordered the snow crab in creamy spicy sauce, which looked a lot like a cheesy pasta bake. On its own the crab was so tasty but there was too much sauce which totally masked the flavour of the crab! :(( The rock shrimp tempura with ponzu sauce were even more disappointing. Although the serving was huge and you could tell the prawns were fresh, you could taste and feel the oil. The ponzu sauce made them so soggy that the batter would peel off as your chopsticks touched it. And you could hardly taste the sauce! When you could, it was delicious, but that rarely happened. I feel like it's the sort of dish that you'd order to keep ravenous teenage boys full on a 'budget'.\nI probably wouldn't be coming back. The quality of their sushi's top tier but at that price, you can get equally fresh sushi elsewhere in London. No reason to come to this particular restaurant other than to say you've dined at Nobu."

    "review": "BOTTOM LINE: Whilst it *definitely* ain't Kaji (Toronto) in terms of quality or creativity, the dishes are solid (but not mind-blowing) and the price factors in star-gazing opportunities.\nCost:\n-\u00a363 (~$101 CAD at time of writing) for the standard seven-course omakase (tax & mandatory 10% tip included).\nAtmosphere/Decor:\n-I sat at the bar where I could watch the chefs work, and whilst they were all solid (some more than others), none could compare to chef Kaji.  Whilst I realize that these guys have to prepare for more people, it just makes you appreciate how much time and care chef Kaji places into its few.  Sorry if this review is turning into an indirect one for Kaji Sushi.  :P\nOrdered:\n-There's your standard menu where you can order individual items and a choice of two omakase: the standard \u00a355 one and the more \"creative\" \u00a365 one.  I ordered the standard one:\n1. Tuna tartare with special peach - The tuna was fresh, but perhaps the best part was the peach!\n2. Tuna salad with shrimp - The dressing was a bit strong and hid the flavour of the tuna, and the shrimp looked and tasty somewhat bland.\n3. Black cod miso - Everybody seems to rave about this as the *BEST* thing ever, and whilst it's well done, I just don't understand the hype.  Many standard Chinese restaurants can steam / grill all kinds of fishes that are just as good.  A nice touch was the tasty rod of white ginger.\n4. Scottish beef tataki - As per its name, the beef was nicely seared on the outside and placed on a sizzling plate with fresh asparagus and enoki / shitake mushrooms.  The sauce was much too salty for me, but it was interesting to eat different slices of beef at various levels of 'well-doneness\".\n5. Sushi platter - Standard sushi with nice rolls made from soft shell crab and asparagus.\n6. Miso soup - Does this really count as a course?\n7. Cappuccino icecream - You can't really go wrong with this!\n-As a side note, I tried Nobu Miami a few years ago and it was good to see my favourite dish - yellowtail with jalapeno - still on the menu. I wished I had the appetite to order it again!\nService:\n-Staff were friendly, if not a bit detached, and the dishes were served at a good pace.  No complaints."

Not knowing the lay of the land, while strolling in from the rain it's hard not to think when you check in your coat on the ground floor, whether that cloakroom was 'the place' that Boris Becker had his 'moment of madness'. But stroll up the stairwell and you're greeted by (for the most part) uber efficient front of house staff in a light and airy dining room with large windows that provide a panoramic view of Park Lane. Not my favourite part of town, and certainly not as convenient location wise for me, per se.\nI'm gonna say it, but wasn't keen on the somewhat unnecessarily loud 'nameste' style greeting that is chanted to you by staff when you enter the actual dining area. Because ultimately that means you have to hear it many more times after you're seated! \nWe sat at a window banquette and like Berkeley Street, the tables are SMALL! Food wise for me the tempura while expensive remains a must (a perfect case in point that quality over quantity wins the day). And my spicy garlic vegetable Donburi was extremely delicious and generous (I almost finished it all). \nAlthough you can't help but think, despite the Michelin star, at the end of the day, my meal format at a linear level was akin to an (admittedly) upscale Wagamama Yasai Cha Han, right down to the sides of Miso soup and plate of pickles (or maybe Waga's is copying Nobu?) \nMy friend's Bento Box though was in a class of its own, both in presentation and the vast array of foods on offer including the signature black cod. She also ordered her favourite drink, a watermelon Martini (which you won't find in a Wagas!), which she swears by. I opted for a more pedestrian Diet Coke and tap water, because let's be honest the Fijian mineral water they serve is a rip off and pure marketing hype. The carbon footprint must be horrendous.\nThe dining room was busy, but I reckon you could have walked in without a reservation. Times are hard, it seems, even for Nobu. I'd be tempted to go there for a (special) dinner date, but for lunch I'd probably stick to Berkeley Street."

It's certainly not cheap - \u00a380 for the 'set meal' (before the pricey drinks), but they can charge this because they make the food like pieces of artwork.\nWhilst I'd prefer to give the restaurant 90% rather than 100% (the food was mainly fantastic, but a couple of dishes were only 'really good'), giving an 80% would seem unfair. This is clearly a place for foodies with a sense of style. I won't be back every week, or even every couple of months, but I will plan another visit at some point. It's a place for special occasions.\nService was good - polite and friendly. I know some have said the service is mediocre or poor, but we were very happy with the attention we received. The ambience was classy, but not romantic. There was a bit of a buzz, a bit of a vibe, and it felt good to be sitting by a window looking out towards Hyde Park. I bet it would be even better on a summer evening at dusk. \nOverall, I've given a 5 out of 5, as it's the best dining experience I've had in a long time.

Soft, light, flaky cod smothered in salty, earthy miso paste satisfies that part of you that can never get full from eating raw fish. Another stand out dish is the seared kobe steak, seared rare, with some delicious alcohol-based sauce. The fat from the steak is for sure an artery clogger, but it almost melts in your mouth. Very, very tasty.\nThe decor leaves something to be desired - it's rather plain, but then almost all Nobu restaurants are rather plain. It's perhaps a nod to the zen-like simplicity of Japanese decor, and almost a reminder to focus on your food."

    "review": "Not a meal for the sustainably minded, that's for sure. Only the popular fish get any attention at this celebrity luncheon spot. And wow this place is expensive! (\u00a360pp for lunch). I will say that the food and drinks were really nice. The bar serves a surprisingly subtle bloody Mary with wasabi and tankatsu sauce. I'll definitely be making this one at home, so thanks for the inspiration! \nSadly I couldn't justify spending \u00a332 for their signature black cod with miso. Instead I had a Latin spiced ribeye over rice, which was a delightfully spicy riff on the Japanese meat over rice dishes like katsudon and unagidon. On the more traditional end, my lady had the prixe-fixe sushi lunch, which featured only the highest quality designer fish (like bluefin and wild salmon). The hand rolled maki (the lady called them Japanese tacos) were particularly delicious. \nThe low point for me was cultural... while the excellent service made me feel like I was getting my money's worth, it's make me wiggle when all the servers yell \"irashaimase\" when customers walk in and there's not a Japanese soul in sight."

    "review": "I've been to Nobu in NYC and Vegas and decided on this location, which my wife told me was \"less of a scene\" than the other London location. I love the food here. Fresh, light, creative and spicy. \nWe started with some sushi, which is always excellent here. We had spicy tuna and a California roll. It was as good as sushi can be in my book. We then chose a selection of small plates as we always do, instead of going with the larger entree portion. Grilled Asparagus with spicy salsa was an exciting opener. The always delectable rock shrimp in vinegary Ponzu sauce followed and reinforced its claim as the best selection at Nobu. Squid \"pasta\" with asparagus and shitake mushrooms in an oyster sauce has become another dependable selection that we enjoyed. Our last small dish was Peruvian Spicy Chicken skewers, which brought the heat. The staff was helpful with our wine selection and we went with a nice fruity white that balanced the heat of our dishes nicely. They also kept the wine flow perfectly measured with our meal. and it lasted for our entire dinner. We finished with the Fuji apple, which we enjoyed very much. \nAlways the scene, this Nobu location did not disappoint either. There were certainly a few very large tables of glitterati and scenesters and I have never seen dresses and skirts like that outside of Vegas. However, my wife and I were able to have a delicious meal and had no problem hearing each other or being too crowded. \nThe one thing I don't get is what is up with the bar. We arrived on time for our reservation and although the restaurant had just opened and was empty, we were shuffled off to their bar/lounge. I'm here for dinner and am going to put away at least one bottle of wine easy. I guess if cocktails are your thing this probably wouldn't bother you, but I looked at it as a delaying annoyance of padding the bill with overpriced drinks. My wife and I always get a kick out of places that are part club and part restaurant. As the saying goes \"a jack of all trades is a master of none.\" \nThat said, I was here to eat and it lived up to every great memory I have had of dining at Nobu. Excellent food and impeccable service. Enjoy."

    "review": "Went there with two friends, for lunch they have the set menu for 26 quid. I was really courious because it's such a famous place, it has to be THE BEST.\nWe tried the luncheon menu with beef in wasabi sauce, a mixed sushi and sashimi lunch and their signature dish, highly recomended by the waitress: the balck cod everithing with the sake tasting.\nThe food is really good, fresh, amazing flavours.\nThe cod was surprisingly delicious, perfectly cooked and with a lovely subtle sweet flavour.\nI have to say NOBU has god a way with dressing sauces, everithing was so well balanced and delicious, even the salad dressing (we've been told that's made with 10 ingredients, the main 3 are onions, black pepper and japanese mustard).\nThe beef was perfectly cooked and the wasabi sauce simply delicious.\nAnd I'm still thinking about the mouthwatering of the tuna.... sooooo good.\nThen we tried a bento chocolate box wich is practically a choccolate souffle', served warm with green tea ice cream on the side.\nThe souffle' was perfect, light and crunchy outside with a warm creamy heart. And the ice cream itself was really nice, gentle taste.\nBut the match of them wasn't right for me, the ice cream is just too delicate for the choccolate flavour. It's just not right, the ice cream disappear on your mouth leaving only a cold sensation when you eat the two ingredient together.\nThe staff is really nice, our waitress has been very helpful.\nStill I didn't like that they cleaned the plates away without asking if we were done (they took away the salad I was slowly enjoying on the side of everything else).\nThey gave us the wrong beef at the beginning, and even if everything was really good, I definitely have to say that is overpriced. It's true you're in central London and you're overlooking hide park but this is not a good reason to let me pay 32 quid for a portion of cod!!\nA special mention for the toilet which are pretty small (specially because are shared with the meetings room on the 1st floor, but I find amazing the special make up side with armchairs, white light and mirrors to retouch your make up.\nStill I think whenever I want to eat great japanese food I'll go back to TOSA in chiswick, same level of quality for half the price."

    "review": "Nobu is definitely one of the best restaurants I have been lucky enough to try in London. Although just some of the full height windows benefit of the view on Hide Park, the inside environment is intriguing and pleasant; the designer managed to mix a contemporary-fashion style preserving a easily perceivable Japanese influence. While waiting to be seated at the table, one can enjoy a cold glass of champagne in the comfortable love-seats in the waiting area. Wine list absolutely remarkable although the waiters tend to pour too much wine in a single time. Had delicious fresh filleted tuna and desserts but what absolutely stood out was the black cod. Apart from the exquisite taste, smoked at the right point, it literally melts in your mouth. The black cod is definitely the reason that makes me want to be back. One caveat: when one walks through the glass doors of The Metropolitan Hotel, he has to be aware that his dinner will most likely be very expensive. However, Nobu fully deserves both its Michelin star and the price paid for some of the plates."

    "review": "I went to Nobu a few months ago for lunch with a friend, and we had a lovely experience. We had a seat by the window overlooking Hyde Park, and it was a nice sunny day.\nWe had 3 dishes, some sushi/sashimi, dessert, and a couple of drinks each. The 3 dishes we ordered were - shrimp and lobster with spicy lemon sauce, pan fried dover sole with red chilli salsa, seafood toban yaki. We also ordered a selecton of sashimi - yellowtail, salmon, sea bream, mackerel, sweet shrimp. For dessert, we both had the chocolate bento box. I had a couple of mojitos with the meal, and my friend had a raspberry cooler.\nShrimp & lobster with spicy lemon sauce - A salad of fresh leaves and enoki mushrooms, topped with shrimp and chunky lobster pieces, and a tangy lemon sauce. The dish wasn't swimming in sauce, but there was enough to coat everything and it helped to lift the flavours of the shrimp and lobster. This was a perfect way to start the meal, as my tastebuds were now tingling.\nPan fried dover sole with red chilli salsa - this came out next, and I was blown away by the presentation. There were 4 fillets of fish, on a frosted glass plate, swimming in a red chilli salsa, and right in the middle, was the head and backbone of the fish, deep fried and curled up into a \"C\" shape, with the tail suspended in mid-air. The fish was nice and fresh, and again, the sauce was very tasty. Not overpoweringly spicy, but enough to make my tastebuds tingle. We wiped the plate clean.\nSeafood \"toban\" yaki - this came out last, and I am glad they left it til the end. It was basically a flat claypot with a lid (the \"toban\"), and when you opened it, the aroma that came out was unbelievable. It had a lovely savoury, vinegary smell, and inside the toban were clams, shrimp, fish, swimming in a lovely soy/vinegar sauce. The seafood was firm and fresh, and the sauce was the best of the 3 dishes. It was so good, for the remainder of the meal, I kept stopping to savour the smell as other tables had their \"toban\" yaki delivered to them. I really enjoyed this dish.\nThe sashimi came out next, and by comparison, the \"wow\" factor wasn't there, compared with the previous 3 dishes. The fish was definitely of good quality, but I suppose there wasn't much difference between Nobu's sashimi and other places I've been to (e.g. Inaho, Yoshino). As before, the fish was firm and fresh, but the sweet shrimp was slightly slimy. \nTo finish, we had the chocolate bento box, and it was a chocolate fondant with a scoop of green tea ice cream in a bento box. The fondant itself was good, nice and warm with a lovely gooey, liquid centre. The ice cream was the best green tea ice cream I've had, it had a lovely deep smokey green tea flavour. A good way to end the meal.\nI also had the vanilla and apple mojito, and the pear and cinnamon mojito. I enjoyed both, and preferred the apple over the pear, as the apple flavour was more distinct, compared with the pear. The glasses were quite generous, and the vodka was nice and strong.\nThe meal ended up costing over \u00a3200, which is quite expensive. I would definitely recommend their special dishes, but wouldn't necessarily go back for the sashimi, as you can get similar quality sashimi at other top japanese restaurants. Worth going to for a treat."

I'm not even a big fan of Japanese food, but you'd have to be mad not to love Nobu.\n I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you pick from the menu, but the famous black cod with miso lives up to its reputation, the yellowfin sashimi was absolutely outstanding, and the seared beef with spring onion and garlic chips left me speechless. I've never eaten so much raw or seared food in my life, but I am now completely converted.\n The staff were friendly, incredibly efficient and looked after us brilliantly, and I really can't fault the place for food and service.\n The main restaurant looked bustling and atmospheric from what I saw, with plenty of movers and shakers and an appearance from Kylie (or so the tramp outside told one of my fellow diners!)\n If you want a memorable dinner, this is definitely the place to go.

(Mark is sort of Global Head Chef and a partner of Nobu Matsuhisa, Nobu has 15+ places from LA to NYC, London to Hong Kong. These are part of the Myriad Restaurant Group, where Robert De Niro and Drew Nieporent are amongst the partners, all big playersthen there is a brand owned by Nobu himself, called Matsuhisa, more boutique style, all very complex and strategic)\n Back to our experience, I only realized once seated in the restaurant what a celebrity packed hotspot this was. We came from a Swiss mountain village, so this all in a sudden felt like being seated in the first row of a Film Premiere. Anyway, I don't think this interest anybody, the point is, today in 2007 the restaurant still has a great energy, buzz and nothing is inferior then it was back in 1999, except that the customer base is a touch less celeb-ish, more mixed, tourists, punters out for a great treat, business men, etc.\n Nobu London maintains a 1 Michelin Star since years, and still has one, the service is still very efficient, not always over the top friendly, but the prices are kept steep if not over the top. The Japanese Food with a twist of Peruvian influences is absolutely wonderful, the energy and vibrancy in the restaurant is world class. A magic place that has its price tag.\n If you go there, never miss the signature dishes that are part of the fame. Edamame beans, Yellowtail Jalapeno, Rock Shrimp Tempura (order with 3 sauces) or Creamy Spicy Shrimp, Black Cod Miso, and then have a selection of Sushi, it is top end, can't get much better then this outside Japan. No matter what, don't miss the desserts, they are a class of its own, from a pastry chef that worked for Adrian Ferra at El Bulli. To drink, maybe try a Bamboo pitcher of Junmai Daignjo quality Sake.\n I am not always convinced about the new dishes; they are great if one is a repeat customer dining often in Nobu, but for a one off treat, stick to the classics. The thing with the one off treat people is a bit reflected in the customer picture, at the steep prices i.e. for 2 people you easily hit the \u00a3200+ mark, and an exorbitant service charge knocked on top of the bill, understandable\n For quick and more affordable meals, the Sushi counter, where no reservations are taken, is also a great treat. You can get a good flavour of the buzz in the place around \u00a3110+ for two.\n Overall, it is an institution and there are newer places on the market, the likes of Zuma, who are for sure heavy competitors and have taken over some of Nobu's regular clientele and fame in the last years. In the end I think, one is a Nobu-san or Zuma-san, all depending on the first experience you had, maybe I am influenced from the 1999 one, and therefore definitely a Nobu-san.\n (\"Nobu - The World's Sexiest Restaurant\" The Observer, April 2001)\n NB: Then there is the new Nobu Berkeley Street, for great food go to Park Lane, then for drinks to Berkeley, more clubby feel, the food is not the same, just the prices."

While this location is accessible I recommend the one in Mayfair, its a bit nicer and more upscale."

Lucky for me, I was the friend. We somehow nabbed a Friday night reservation and kicked off with cocktails at the bar before being guided to a lovely table looking across to Hyde Park. Everything on the menu looked great, but when the waiter came to take our order and we looked up with those we can't decide faces, he kindly suggested we select the chef's tasting menu. What the hell! We weren't paying. \nThe miso was delicious, the sushi fresh and sashimi dissolved on the tongue. The famous Nobu miso cod was just as good as we'd heard, with a subtle sweetness lingering after each bite and spicy prawns came sizzling to the table in an oh-so Japanese way. Finished off with the refreshing taste of green tea ice cream. Now Nobu has changed rank to my Restaurants to Hit Again Soon list. Warning - NOT credit crunch friendly unless some kind benefactor donates the cost of dinner here."

The novelty does, however, wear off after seeing the bill so try the Nobu bento box which is great value, has the black cod as a taster within, and at about \u00a320 will not break the bank. Although the majority of the lunchtime guests are dressed very casual it can still seem a very formal restaurant so be prepared as the odd waiter can be a little off  guess the friendliest are sent to perform on x factor. Seriously though, a must visit for lunch just to taste some real tasty treats."

Sushi ranged from good to nearly great, plus a memorable salmon skin salad (though slightly too salty). Sakatinis were reliable and we had a decent onigoroshi sake which was good and not badly priced. Overall, a good place to eat, but be prepared to pay over the odds (just make a reservation for the New York branch instead - better value) and the ambience is somewhat hotel restaurant like. In summary, Nobu London epitomizes London - you get great stuff (food, service etc.) if you are prepared to pay, and pay. All your staff will be foreign (eastern Europe), well dressed and pleasant. I hope they get some of the massive tip revenues the place generates."

I think we both also appreciate its simplicity, with basic wooden furnishings and straight-to-the-point staff, which I guess lends it authenticity. There's also something endearing about its no-tips policy which I'm told is the norm in Japan.\nIt's a menu of no-frills Japanese dishes and I usually go for one of the donburi bowls which I find quite filling (and the boy usually finishes mine too). He's quite fond of the chicken katsu curry too, and we usually pair it with mugs of hot green tea. The food is nothing particularly creative then but executed well.\nIt's not the cheapest at c\u00a39-10 a main but very reasonable for the area, and with the added perks of speedy service and a haven from the crowds (esp if you sit in the quiet basement area). Recommended if you're craving an asian food hit in the area - I know we'll be back!"

That being said, the staff is extremely accommodating to diners and offers a great deal of information about their food and the customs associated with a Japanese meal (no tipping, free tea, free extra portions of rice) on their menu. \nAnother thing I love about this place is their extensive lunch menu (so cheap) and the further discounts they offer--if you rock up between 3-6pm (their least busy hours) they offer a \u00a31 discount off of their already affordable fare. \nWhen planning a meal in Chinatown it can be difficult to be decisive--as delicious food surrounds you from all angles--but the next time you're faced with a moment of indecision, I urge you to check this place out."

I also read on the menu that you can get an extra-large portion of rice at no additional cost. \nI really enjoyed my food. It has been a while that I just had a katsu curry without anything fancy or the chef hyping it up. Good tasting and fresh :) It reminds me of what a katsu curry originally taste like.\nThe place is nicely decorated to look traditionally Japanese, so very simple. They do try to maximize the space as much as possible, so I felt like I was having lunch with the people sitting at the next table. Perhaps this is part of the appeal. \nIf I am hungry in Chinatown and unsure of where to go for a sure-thing good tasting meal, I would certainly return. However, I would not travel just to eat here."

The staff were very friendly, and I like how, if you're especially famished, you can ask for an Omari portion which is larger but free serving of rice. Mmmm.\nAs it stands, I was particularly hungry and got myself Omari with a Katsu which was dreamy. Tokyo Diner's authentic no-tips policy took me back to the land of the rising sun, and I shall be defo coming back here, as soon as I can.\nThe maps of Japan have also had a knock-on effect of making me wanting to travel again, so at least I have something else to daydream about for a few days :)\nPrice wise, \u00a310 for a meal which isn't bad for the centre of town."

The chicken itself was pretty tasty but not amazing. I would have priced it at \u00a34.50. Also since this doesn't come with rice I had to order it separate. The miso soup was a bit bland, I've had better. My husband had the katsu curry and said that both the curry and the katsu were very bland. The included salad was not the best.

    "review": "A simple no fuss Japanese restaurant.  There is nothing  I could fault about the food in this place. I couldn't give it 5 stars because it was just simple Japanese comfort food, nothing out of ex-ordinary and all the usual Japanese dishes I could get in any other Japanese restaurant. Tokyo Diner focuses really mainly on one plate dishes like donburi and also their famous big portion bento boxes. There are also sushi platters but it just does not have a large a la carte menu. It's a place for a quick fulfilling dinner if you don't fancy Chinese in China town. \nI do love it's concept of 'No Tipping'. With its free tea, Japanese crackers and no service charge it felt like a Japanese Wong Kei's with better service and better food. Portions were just as big though with free refills of rice for those extra hungry ones. Awesome.\nWe started with starters of agedashi tofu, spinach goma, miso soup and pickles. The tofu was average, not the most silky I've had but still very satisfying in a very well made dashi sauce. Spinach goma stood out the most although I wish they let it warm up a bit rather than it come out straight out the fridge, Still I love the nutty sesame sauce that made this dish so moorish. It tasted just like peanut butter but sweetened and gave the dish a slight sticky texture. It no longer felt healthy but indulgent instead. Wasn't a fan of the plum pickle that was too sour but the rest was fine.\nMy main of pork katsu was massive with a lovely marinated leaf salad on the side. It was one of the better ones I've had with next chunky soft carrots and potatoes in the curry which was perfectly seasoned and flavoured, not too sweet or salty. The katsu was perfectly fried, a nice crunchy batter into a thick succulent tender piece of pork. Rice was fluffy and cooked perfectly. A good choice.\nHowever weirdly enough I preferred my boyfriend's tamago don. Something so simple like on egg on rice was so good and comforting. Where my katsu curry cooled down very quickly my boyfriend's dish remained hot throughout due to the egg acting like a blanket. It was soft, mouthmetling and cooked in a dashi stock that wrapped it in a nice savoury flavour. Together with the al dente sticky rice it was just the perfect combination. \nWe also shared a zaru soba which was faultless again. A nice portion, noodles cooked as they should and sauce flavoured well. \nThe most disappointed part was our cold sake which tasted like they had watered it down. Still it did not effect our overall opinion of the place as we were very satisfied with meal. \nI do love this place and will probably return very soon. The automatic push button door was a nice touch as it made my boyfriend feel nostalgic about his holiday memories in Japan as apparently those doors were common over there. Also that and the light wooden tables, Japanese staff, a large map of Japan and the rest of the decor. With that in mind and the cheap generous prices do prepare to queue or get there a bit early."

The setting of the restaurant is very basic and small (don't dress up for this). All staff is Japanese and very friendly & humble. They refuse any tips because \"it's not part of the Japanese culture\" (their words). They don't sell Tuna because they believe in only serving sustainable food. As much as I love tuna, I can only truly admire this choice and position they take.\nThe food was really good. We didn't eat as much as we normally do at a Japanese place but had a fair amount of salmon sushi (really fresh), pork with curry (tasted like other ones I had before) and Udon noodles (almost the most recommendable dish of the menu! Only \u00a38 for the noodles with chicken and better than any other trendy Udon place I've been to in Soho).\nOverall, all the prices are VERY reasonable (almost cheap) for such quality! It's about \u00a32-3 for a beer for example.

It was different from the Katzu I am used to, in this version, Katzu was cooked first and then cooked with eggs to form a pancake that covered the rice in the bowl.

Anyway, now that I've been it renders my introduction totally pointless but hey, I had to write something there.\nTD prides itself on being open 365 days a year from 12 until 12 - they're basically the guardian angel of Japanese food.  As of the time of review (Jan 2015), they haven't been opening on Mondays due to staff shortage - whether this is a temporary or more permanent measure I'm not sure, but I'll update the tips as and when.  A couple of other things:\n- they don't accept tips (as it is not a Japanese custom) giving any mistaken tips to the homeless\n- they don't serve tuna (eco decision)\n- there's a full list of allergens in their food on the back pages.\nThere's nothing outlandish about the menu - it's pretty much on par with similar places such as Eat Tokyo - soba, curries, donburi, and a smallish selection of sushi/sashimi - simple and good.\nWhen I went, I tried the oyakodon (a hearty combination of infanticide and matricide - it's a delicious chicken omelette cooked in dashi stock), wakame seaweed salad, and chicken karaage.  The salad was fine, although not as tasty as I expected (could've done with more dressing.  Japanese dressing is the beeeest) and the kara-age was decent, if not the best; that said, the flavour was good as they've got the marinade right.  The oyakodon was solid - not overcooked and with a strong dashi flavour.  Prices are reasonable - \u00a38.50 for the oyakodon, curry dishes are around \u00a310.50 - whilst not cheap cheap, the place is good value given the quality of the food.  As it's well known to everyone apart from me, it gets fairly busy, but it has quite a bit of downstairs seating; service isn't super friendly but it was reasonably efficient when I went, so all's good.

They donate all their tips to charity, and they give you more rice if you ask for it.\nThe people in the Tokyo Diner are nice people.\nIt also helps that their food is also pretty good. It's not going to change the world, but it's well-prepared, honestly priced and arrives as soon as it's ready. This can cause some social complications if someone in a group orders a quickly prepared dish (something like the aubergine - something I strongly recommend - which is served cold), though. The lunch deals are all very good value and come with a selection of pickles, miso soup and a side dish that varies day to day. Everyone also gets free tea (and refills!) and some rice crackers to munch while they wait.\nThe only slight downside is that there's no tempura on the menu, which struck me a bit strange for a place focused on bento-style meals, but it's not exactly the end of the world.  On balance, it's one of the better 'authentic' Japanese places around here."

They all look similars and you wonder if the quality is everywhere good not to be disapointed and unfortunately it's not ! \nThat's why I definitely recommand to go to this address. It has good prices, ethical concept (they don't use tuna because it's a specie in danger even it's cultural for Japanese to normally eat it) they don't take tip and ask instead to come back and bring friend ! Love the concept :-)\nInside the decoration is classic, wood table and some Japanese flag as decoration. You have lunch menu or a la carte suggestion. You can go for hot meal such as soup or fried meat or fish but also some sushi and cold sashimi. \nI've been a couple of time and never been disapointed. The service is efficient, polite and friendly even quite shy as it's common in asian culture. Might be busy but worth make a try and even try a bit if the queue is not too long. If this one is full, then walk around and catch one with as much as stickers as possible from all the guides and travels books that have rated the place, the best way to find something else !"

Lots of people people have a katsu dish of some description because it's reliable, but the bento boxes are also good.\n One minor gripe: they missed one of the dishes from our group and we had to wait quite a long time for it.

Tokyo Diner have a sustainable food policy, which means no tuna at present, but the rest of the menu more than compensates, including authentic japanese dishes like Zaru Soba (buckwheat noodles on a bamboo mat, you dip the noodles in the given soy-based sauce then slurp), and delicious agedashi tofu which was pretty much inhaled rather than eaten.\n 2. No tipping! As they don't tip in Japan, any money mistakenly left on the tables is given to a London homeless charity. This hippy-esque approach only serves to increase my newfound love of the place, I'm so happy to report the food was as good as the philosophy behind it.\n So, excellent pricing structures, a smile on arrival and a great location will make Tokyo Diner my next pre-cinema dinner choice.\n Dinner: around \u00a39-15 per person for food and tea."

    "review": "For photos please refer to\nhungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026\n \n Ironically in the middle of Chinatown there is Tokyo Diner, a cheap but decent Japanese restaurant. Even though the owner appears to be English (if you agree with me that Richard Hills does not sound terribly Japanese) the place has a distinct Japanese atmosphere to it. I have just been to Japan couple of months ago and Tokyo Diner feels very much like one of the Izakayas I went to in Kobe. I am talking not only about the furnishing and (as far as I can judge it) Japanese waiters but also the fact that, just like in Japan, tips are not taken, that you pay on the counter when you leave and that green tea (I think it was Hojicha) is served free of charge.\n The menu is really weird but at the same time rather entertaining: you can spend ages reading the detailed description about every dish as well as some trivia about Japan and Japanese food. In addition the menu contains 5 whole pages with allergy information regarding the nuts/seeds and gluten content for each individual dish.\n The food only partly lived up to my expectations. I was a bit disappointed actually by the Hoso-MakiI Set (6.20). The rice was too sticky and the salmon didn't taste that fresh. The vegetarian cucumber and pickled radish maki were much better actually but also they did not quite satisfy my palate which has become used to the outstanding quality of sushi in Japan.\n I love all kinds of Japanese noodles and particularly when I am hungover, as I happened to be at this particular occasion, nothing is comparable to the healing powers of a Japanese noodle soup. I chose the Curry Udon with Chicken (8.20) which was a very decent bowl of soup drenched with the rather mild but strangely addictive flavour of Japanese curry. The udon were not quite Koya quality but really not bad at all.\n It is not the best Japanese restaurant I have ever been to but considering how cheap, friendly and uncomplicated it is, it is well worth a visit for a quick pre-theatre bite or for a hangover cure."

As a vegetarian, or even vegan, you're more than welcome and they mark vegan dishes especially.\n Then there's the free green tea that the friendly staff top up without needing a prod, free large rice portions (ask for an oumori portion), and the refreshing 'no tips' policy, and I'd say it's a winner. Sugoi!\n (PS: Wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a fancy dining experience, but at the prices offered, it's definitely fantastic value for money)"

I gave some advice, but their tastes (ie meat!) are different to mine so they asked the waitress. Very unhelpful. There was just no sense of 'oh try this' or 'if you like that then this is for you'. It was as if she hated being there and was nervous about anyone saying anything that resembled a question and didn't know what to do when it happened.\nWe ordered edamame to get things started.... which was fine until one of the party found a live maggot crawling over them... ok, so you don't eat the skins, but... just..... no. not for me, thanks. After the earlier 'conversation' with the waitress, we felt at pains to point it out, and we were tired anyway so didn't want to kick up a fuss.\nThe rest of the food was fine.

They refuse to serve some popular sushi fish because of the unsustainable fishing practices that have depleted their stocks; they provide smaller portions for most dishes with the option to get more for a small price in order to prevent wasting food that people don't finish, and to top it all off the price that they ask for the meal is final and there's no haggling over a tip for the service. It's included.\nI suppose I should have gotten to the food by now, which is great! Even if you can't have your big eye tuna sashimi, their sushi rolls are tasty and the noodle soups can be quite filling. They also serve beer and sake.\nTokyo Diner isn't very big, and it's not exactly a secret as these reviews and the front window, almost entirely obscured by stickers from various London food guides, can attest. Still, it's a great find and a choice place to stop for a lunch or dinner in the area."

We have eaten here over a period of at least 10 years and have never been disappointed with the food or the service.\n The restaurant is on 3 floors, but the service is excellent no matter which floor you are seated in. \nAll of the food is fresh and of excellent quality, and you can have noodle dishes, bento boxes, sushi and loads more! The cost is very reasonable and it's a great place to take friends, especially if you are attending a film in any of the nearby theatres.\n In proper Japanese-style, they don't allow tipping.\n This is one restaurant I always recommend to any friends visiting London."

The sushi was all fresh and the nigiri were a good size. They give you free green tea with your meal as well, and in Japanese fashion, they don't accept tips (anything extra you leave behind goes to a homeless charity). There's also no tuna on the sushi menu as they refuse to serve any unsustainable fish. This part of town is full of little Japanese restaurants but this is one of the best I've been to - it's not fancy inside but the service is friendly, fish is fresh and it's pretty moderately priced for sushi."

I have been wanting to go here for a while since I saw their vegetarian bento box, advertised as absolutely vegan, and partly intrigued by their marketing strategy of \"no tips - it's just not japanese\" which is prominently displayed on signs throughout the restaurant. Because I was on my own I was shown downstairs, into a somewhat depressing cellar space. Before ordering you can specify that you are extra hungry, and get a larger helping of rice for free (apparently if you do this too late you are out of luck for some reason - why you can't  get this if you ask later is beyond me. Another nice addition is the free Japanese tea; though I did have to go out of my way to get them to refill (service was only OK and it was one of those places where you can't seem to make eye contact with the wait-staff). The cost of the bento box is not cheap - 10.50 Pounds - but that's probably about standard for this area. The food itself was so-so. The four tiny sushi were just ok, and definitely not fresh. There was very little in the way of wasabi. The rice was OK, and the cooked vegetables tasty, if not stellar. The sesame seaweed salad was excessively oily. The best thing about this place was that it was reasonably filling, and there were no hidden costs; the downside is that the food just wasn't that nice. If you can get a table upstairs the ambiance would certainly be better."

I've been twice to this restaurant and I'm glad I went the second time because the first left me with a bad impression.\nThe secret to this place is that it is not about sushi. If your looking for a Sushi restaurant instead of a Japanese food restaurant I suggest you look elsewhere.\nThe second time I went I ordered the Chicken Katsu Bento and it was extremely good. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the sashimi portion, which consisted of two slivers of low quality salmon.\nThe service is fast and friendly. All food, excepting the sushi, was great quality, well prepared and very tasty. The price is very reasonable for what you get, so although it isn't cheap (or expensive) it is very high value.\nNot a michelin star \"foody\" destination but a great place to enjoy an efficient, tasty and good value meal."

The katsu curry - whether chicken or pork - is the most popular dish here, but the sushi is also excellent with good salmon and tuna. It's also big enough to be able to find tables for people even on a Saturday night. This mild curry is made in generous portions. It is mild with potato and carrot forming the bulk of the dish.

From the side way sliding doors, natural wood interior and Japanese waitresses all waiting to take your order, you'll feel like you've just arrived in Japan. I've been here several times because the place is non-complicated. The menus have everything you'd expect from a sushi restaurant with ramen and great bento box dishes to enjoy. I usually come here for the lunch time bento box and I find them very filling. I recommend this place to my friends and to you as it is a hassle-free Japanese zone. However, it does get busy during the evenings so coming during the day when the sun is out is probably best. Lots of Japanese calligraphy on the wall and a good view of what's happening downstairs in Newport place. It is a good place to have a conversation with your friends and there are also pegs on the walls for people to hook their jackets and bags for extra security. The price ranges from \u00a37, which is good enough for such a lively and peaceful atmosphere. I found that the sunny days in the upstairs area were the best days to come here. This is a good place for couples, yet you might have to book in advance if you'd like to bring a group of four. The Tokyo diner is not large enough for big parties unfortunately.; ("

Service was slow but polite. The atmosphere was incredibly relaxing and it felt like one could stay at the table all night talking and unwinding. I got the braised lamb with stuffed mushrooms as a first course. The mushrooms were well seasoned and topped with a generous helping of herbs and goat cheese (double yum!). The lamb was cut into thick, juicy slices and resting on a bed of roast potatoes, steamed carrots and green beans, mashed potatoes, and ratatouille. Absolutely fabulous. Everything tasted amazing. The only incident was the small deep fried ball of meat that came on the side of my plate. I thought it looked like some sort of deep fried organ so I didn't eat it...

The bread was so fresh and soft yet the outside perfectly crispy. Everything we ordered was great and I would highly recommend this spot! The upstairs area is smaller and doesn't have air conditioning, which is fine normally but we were visiting on an 80 degree day- so just keep that in mind!

It was fairly empty at the time, so we had our pick of indoor and outdoor seating; we picked a small table inside, right by a window, and got a nice view of the street and nearby buildings. There was also plenty of seating, as well as toilets, downstairs, although no one was sitting downstairs because it was so sunny outside (the downstairs area was quite dark but would probably be cozy in the evenings). We were greeted promptly by our server.\nBoth of us ordered the butternut squash and goat cheese salad (my friend is a vegetarian). The food came out pretty quickly. I was pleased with how generous they were with the toppings; they had completely covered the greens with goat cheese, sliced nuts, and squash. The salad came with dressing on, but I'm sure you could ask for it on the side. It was really tasty; there might actually have been too much cheese, but as goat cheese is my favorite, I was pretty happy with it. The salads came with 1 basket of bread that we split; we wound up ordering more, since there wasn't that much in the 1st basket. The bread was accompanied by some seasoned olive oil, which also had sesame seeds in; it was pretty addicting for me as a bread lover. However, as it was a French restaurant, I was expecting the bread to be better; it was good, but I wasn't as blown away as I have been at some other French/Italian/Spanish restaurants.\nFor dessert we split (well, I had 75% of it) a pear tarte tatin (when asked, the server informed us the dessert special of the day was mango sorbet). The tarte was a good size and really tasty; it was served warm. If my friend had been hungrier, I would've wanted to order 2 desserts, as the tarte wasn't really big enough to split equally between 2 people (although I have a big appetite so your mileage may vary).\nThe restaurant had a great atmosphere and a nice view of the street. We were allowed to take our time and weren't bothered much by anyone throughout our leisurely meal. The facilities and tables were clean. The ceiling was decorated with some humorous sayings, so look up if you visit. Our meal came out to be about \u00a315/person, including 1 glass of wine, 1 dessert, and an extra basket of bread. I really enjoyed my lunch here and would happily return if I'm ever in the area again."

We had the restaurant to ourselves for a little while and we felt welcome and very comfortable in the cozy and inviting dining room.\nMy wife had the steak and brie baguette with onions and horseradish mayonnaise and I had the steak frites. Both of our meals were simply amazing. I followed it off with some chocolate mousse which was the best mouse I have had since my last visit to Paris last year.\nThis restaurant should be a must stop for anyone in this part of London."

The combo comes with a starter+entr\u00e9e or entr\u00e9e+dessert, either way you like. I have the soup of the day for starter, which is chicken vegetables soup. It was really good. The soup is neither too salty nor greasy, with lentil, carrot, and some other veggies. I ordered fish soup for entr\u00e9e and I think it would be better if they can squeeze more lemon juice in it. \nThe carafe and water glasses are not very clean though. But the bread is superb. My boyfriend ordered Lamb kidney for starter and Duck leg for entr\u00e9e, he said it was flavorless but I think they are okay. \nThis cafe would be good for you if you are looking for some delicate food with light flavor, and also, if you have enough time since the waiting time is a little long than I have expected."

The interior is cosy (but there is a downstairs eating area in the basement as well) and slightly 'shabby-chic' (which extends to the cutlery and glassware as well).\nThe main event is the food: the two course menu is \u00a324, but there is a cheaper vegetarian menu as well. Desserts are \u00a35.90. For the price, in this area of London, it represents fabulous value, as the quality is very good, mostly in the classic French style.\nOn two recent visits, service was very good - friendly but unobtrusive, and they made a real effort to seta us when they were busy one evening.\nI shall be back."

Of the small amount of choices, the food was savory. The price was on the heavy side of what usually is attributed to this restaurant (due to the holiday limitations).

Easily the best meal we had in London (yet nowhere near the most expensive). We hit some big name restaurants and none of the cooking was as spot on as Savoir Faire. The preparations were beautiful and delicious. \nSavoir Faire is a small, unpretentious, neighborhood restaurant. It is casual and comfortable, but the food is the epitome of French style. We had a very affordable bottle of Chateaudeuf-du-pape. I have to admit that I have forgotten after a almost a month away from home what we had for a starter. We both ordered chicken for dinner. It was moist and delicious with a wonderful array of vegetables, perfectly prepared. We shared a dessert. Everything was perfect. \nThis is the restaurant I will be talking about and recommending to anyone I know heading to London. It is small, so make a reservation, but it is a must try."

When my coworkers and I were on a trip to London and the cuisine agreed upon by the group was French I was not super excited.  But this meal ended up being great!  \nThey have a two course set menu for around 23 pounds.  The various appetizers tried at our table were the grilled fig with goat cheese, the octopus, the mussels, and the fried halloumi - all were excellent and original.  I would give a recommendation, but really that's probably try them all.  The mussels may have been the most unexpected in serving and flavor - they came out of their shells in a special serving dish, and the sauce was incredibly garlicky and delicious.\nFor entrees, our table had the duck, beef bourguignon, lamb shank, and the vegetable plate.  Again, everyone loved theirs.  The sauces were delicious and balanced out the meat perfectly.\nAnd after our fantastic meals, we couldn't stop without dessert.  Our table shared creme brulee, chocolate mousse, and tarte tatin.  And again, everything was excellent.  The chocolate mousse was very rich without being too sweet.  The tarte tatin was very different from ones we have had in the US - the apple was a different texture but delicious.  The creme brulee was excellent as well.\nThe restaurant itself was small and very cute.  A great ambiance.  There were paintings all over the wall, which were definitely different than what we would see in the US, but it was a great little European find for us on our trip."

A few friends and I came here after seeing how it was so highly reviewed on Yelp, and when we got to the restaurant we were surprised (but I guess happy) at how empty yet small it was. There was probably only one other table occupied, and a total of 7 tables in the room we were seated.\nThe menu contained a lot of options, but I wanted something light so I ordered one of the vegetarian dishes. I can't remember what it's called, but it had mushrooms topped with mashed garbanzo beans/chickpeas and a side of broccoli and carrots. I'll admit that when the food first came out I was a bit skeptical since it's not the prettiest dish, but the first bite destroyed any doubt. The taste and texture of the mushroom paired with that of the garbanzo beans was amazing, and the broccoli/carrots were wonderfully cooked as well. I especially liked how the sauce was light and only used to enhance the taste (rather than drenching the food in sauce, which is kind of common nowadays in a lot of restaurants). After finishing I was well-satisfied and happy.\nOverall a great place to eat if you like authentic French food! I loved my experience here (food, service, and the super cute decor)."

Stepping off a busy London street you are immediately transported to a bistro that could be anywhere in France though I like to imagine myself being somewhere in Provence, wild fields of lavender filling the air with an aroma like to no other....anyway....back to the food!\nFor my starter I went for Goose Rillettes served with Spiced Plums, the rillettes had an excellent texture, neither too fatty or to smooth, there was still a nice consistency to it. I sometimes find rillettes made more like a pate, blitzed to hell and back. The goose with the sweet and spicy plums was a lovely match and very tasty.\nFor my main Herb-crusted Rump of Lamb with Celeriac Puree, Balsamic braised Beetroot and Herb and Tomato Jus. Im a sucker for lamb with a crust and this was done supremely well. Cooked with great attention in a pan then oven roasted to melt in the crust the lamb was still beautifully pink. Celeriac is one of my favourite vegetables and the puree was smooth and well seasoned. Delicious.\nWashed all of the lovely food down with a bottle of red, reasonably priced and delicious.\nFinished the night with a French coffee and toddled off into the night very content."

There are two menus, the lighter menu is 15 pounds and includes an entree and your choice of a dessert or appetizer and then there is the 23 pound dinner menu that includes an appetizer and entree. Both are available at dinner periods and both are delicious (I ordered off the pricier dinner menu while my partner ordered off the 15 pound menu and we were both beyond satisfied). I had a glass of house red (\u00a34) and we both shared a dessert afterwards (\u00a36.50) and the best dinner I've had in London came to a well-spent \u00a350.\nService was prompt and friendly and they were even able to fit us in without a reservation, though we came very early. If you plan to eat here after 5:30 I would definitely make a reservation. Off of the cheaper menu I highly recommend the duck legs and off the more expensive menu the lamb shank is delectable.\nPROs:\n- Great french cooking\n- Not dirt cheap, but for what you get it feels like theft\n- Very close to the British Museum, 5 min from the main entrance. About 10 minutes walk from Holborn station.\nCONs:\n- It gets busy quickly, even on weekdays. Make a reservation unless you are willing to take a risk."

We also had lunch here on our last day in London. \nAmbiance: small casual restaurant, dining on the street level and a dining room downstairs. Not very lavish but quaint. The location is great for people watching, located on a busy intersection. The narrow staircase and lighting on the way to the loo could use some work.\nService: two servers at dinner were very helpful, efficient and welcoming. The servers for lunch were not as pleasant, one hardly said a word but smiled a lot. The other server yelled at tired Japanese tourists who sat on the chairs outside. Not very hospitable.\nFood: we really enjoyed our dinner here. I ordered the baked mussels which came in an escargot dish and had the traditional butter, herb and garlic butter. Great for dipping the wonderful bread. My wife ordered the steak frites and I had the calf's liver. Both were very good. No dessert. \nLunch was not as flavorful. We ordered salad, Caesar and the house salad. Neither were exciting, lettuce was not crispy and the vinaigrettes were not very flavorful.

This issue would have also been prevented if they showed us the bottle of wine and permitted us an initial taste as every other restaurant does. After much confusion with another waitress who was on her first day and barely spoke English, she was able to help us to amend the issue and she then brought us our white wine. She filled the glasses to the brim-no exaggeration.\nThe starter and main meal was delicious. My friend got the mussels which I would highly recommend. The lentil moussaka was also delicious.

    "review": "My mother and grandmother were visiting London and I was tasked with finding a place near them for a nice meal on a Friday evening. \nI am pleased to say that Savoir Faire ticked all the boxes we needed for this situation: we needed decent food but not too expensive, with a decent atmosphere but not too loud, walking distance from Russell square, and able to take booking at short notice. We tried a few Italian places near by, but they were not picking up the phone. Their loss, as Savoir Faire allowed us to book online with very little notice; and all four members of our party enjoyed ourselves.\nThe menus were printed on a couple of sheets of A4, in about as slapdash a fashion as you could muster, and then stapled together. But that didn't detract from the selection of great sounding French dishes. The selection was a little modest, but it did have a \"light menu\" of smaller plates and salads. Ideal for the varied crowd at our table.\nFrom the photos I expected quite small but beautifully executed gourmet French dishes, but in actuality it was more classic cooking at affordable prices. That is no bad thing: I cannot resist a beef bourguignon and this one did not disappoint. Flavoursome beef just melted in the mouth alongside creamy mash and rich sauce. Even the most basic of seasonal vegetables; carrots and broccoli, were lovely. Everyone else seemed very pleased with their lamb shank, chicken salad, and duck breast.\nThe service was great too; numerous waitresses were very attentive, swift with drinks, and then left us to chatter long after our last course was finished. The freedom to relax and finish drinks after a meal is a real plus on any venue, I absolutely detest being hurried out of the door or hassled for the bill.\nThe menu as I mentioned was a little on the small side from what I'd expect, but it was by no means bad, and everything we ordered food-wise was excellent. The only real complaint I could give was that the Irish coffee I had afterwards was pretty foul - but I'm not going to get on the back of French restaurant too much for this mistake.\nIf you like classic French dishes, a good atmosphere in a relatively small place, and a good bite to eat at short notice, you should definitely pop in here."

This was my first time here, but I'm thinking they change it often. Regardless I like small menu's, because - as we proved again this evening - it normally means everything is freshly made\nEverything we ordered was fantastic and not to expensive either. You can get away with a 2 course meal for \u00a320"

    "review": "This review covers two different visits:\n1- After our exhausting British museum visit one afternoon, my friend and I stumbled upon this tiny restaurant and recalling that it had been packed the previous night we figured it would be a good place for a much needed dose of caffeine and sweets.  At the time we were the only customers there.  Turns out they have the best latte and Banoffee pie in town, and with a French name you'd expect nothing less- except when we got their business card we noticed that the owner is actually Persian!  Classic switcheroo!  Service was also good (by one of the owners I believe).  There we rested like weary travelers of the days of yore, connected to their free wi-fi, snapped a pic or two, and eventually headed out, highly satisfied with our experience.   4 stars\n2- We returned a few days later, in the evening this time- hoping that the delicious offering on our previous visit was a prelude to amazing things to come on the dinner front.  We made a reservation and when we showed up the place was packed, which we took as a good sign, but there was an eerie tension in the air - most customers either looked irritated or were actually complaining about something - it looked as if many had been waiting for a really long time for their food to arrive.  This time, our waitress had a bit of an attitude problem, which for a small family run restaurant was a little unusual, but luckily wine came to our rescue, there was no great delay with our food and when it did arrive, while not mind-blowing, was above average.  The place definitely has an 'intimate' setting, not necessarily in the romantic sense- well perhaps that too- but it definitely feels cramped when busy, so be prepared to get fairly up close and personal with your neighbour.  As a result, it doesn't score highly for me on the comfort front.  3 stars\np.s.  nowhere is this size inconvenience more... ummm... inconvenient, than the shockingly small bathroom - absolutely horrible- it's midget sized I tell ya!  Avoid a call of nature at all costs - or perhaps try it to fully appreciate my horror!  \nOverall 3.5 stars but since we can't do halves, I'll round it up to 4."

I've been here three times now for my work's Christmas lunch over the years (including 2013) and have been happy each time. \nSavoir Faire's chief strength is its impressive value and quality for the prices charged. Sure, it's been overhauled by Le Mercury on Upper Street, but it's nevertheless much better than most restaurants in its price range. Meat is tender, vegetables well-cooked and desserts satisfying. Service is friendly and accommodating, to the point of allowing us to this year stay a little longer to indulge in some post-lunch quiz action.\nHere's to Christmas 2014!"

The dishes are offered as a set menu or with a few a la carte offerings.\nThe food was just yummy. The rest of my group had hot dishes, but I went for the unique sounding chicken salad. It was the nicest salad I think I've ever had! So many fresh and well-prepared ingredients and beautifully char-grilled chicken to top. The creme brulee wasn't the best ever, but it was tasty (and I can rarely resist a creme brulee)!  My husband had the beef bourguignon and raved about it. \nA quirky little place, but one I would be more than happy to visit again!"

    "review": "After reading all the great reviews about this restaurant we decided to give it a go recently. Overall an ok experience, but nothing really that stood out, hence we probably won't be going back.\nSo to the details... As we arrived we were seated downstairs and the whole area smells of a cellar or a damp basement, which isn't very pleasant but you quickly get used to it. One of the reviewers mentioned images of 'naked ladies' plastering the walls, which we've seen none of - a bit disappointing:)\nThe service was very friendly and attentive, but the food took forever to arrive, so make sure that you allocate plenty of time if you decide to visit. We ordered a french wine (unfortunately I don't remember the name of it), which was recommended as 'owners favourite' and it was in fact quite nice and affordable.\nThe dishes are quite big, so even the most demanding stomachs shouldn't be left disappointed, while those with smaller tummies make sure to NOT eat the bread that's brought in at the start, I know it's fresh, with a crunchy crust and tasty, but otherwise you won't be able to finish your dishes:) \nI had lamb following recommendations of numerous reviewers and my wife had duck. Both dishes were quite nice, but they were very much like home-cooked food I haven't felt anything exquisite about them.\nSo to sum up, the service is great, food takes a while to arrive, the dishes are more like home-cooked rather than French exquisite cuisine."

Honestly, I am so happy with this place and this is coming from someone who normally isnt a huge fan of french food.  \na) Service:  We came in on a Saturday night with no reservations and were greeted with a friendly smile by a lovely lady.  She sat us within 5 minutes and actually moved our seats around to make us more comfortable.\nb) Environment: This place is super cute without being pretentious with smaller tables, which I like so you can actually have a good private conversation. \nc) Food: Exceptional.  You can find as healthy or unhealthy food as you want, with lighter food options ranging from salads and bouillabaise (which incidentally I ordered), to proper  two and three course meals. I know it silly, but we actually  had warm crusty bread, which is one of my favorite things, and they DIDNT charge us -- SHOCKING!!  My husband had the baked goat cheese and tapenade and steak as a main.  My friend had the goose rillette with duck magret.  Everyone gobbled down their meals happily.  We had a carafe of the house red and followed by courvoisier and creme brulee, which I have to say delicious. \nd) Value:  All of the above was around 90 pounds. What a great deal for a VERY expensive city :)  \nI will absolutely be here again with a delicious gourmet meal with beautiful presentation without the price tag."

If you possibly can, get a seat on the street level floor in front of the picture window that looks out on that intersection, which it seems like all of London crosses thru..

Based on Yelp reviews, we dropped in here after exhausting ourselves with an afternoon in the British Museum. Like what everyone else says, it was a treat.. the *best* meal we had during our vacation (but.. well.. not that much competition really.. people are not kidding when they complain about British cuisine), reasonable prices (because we dropped in early, around 6 they gave us a special, lower-priced \"Pre-show\" menu, I guess with smaller portions and one course options that suited us just fine).

This is not some big chain establishment with a million things on the menu but a small, family run place that has a selection that is both authentic and just plain delicious. \nAs mentioned, the restaurant is not some huge chain so reservations are in order. We had a small table with a setting that my wife and I would call romantic. This is the kind of place you go if you want an authentic bistro experience. We might not have gone in had we not known about it from the hotel but there is a reason they have a steady stream of regulars.\nAs for the people, our service was top notch and very attentive. Max, the owner, spent time chatting with us. Leaving aside that he is fascinating in his own right, that he visited with us is and wanted to make sure they were meeting our expectations, which they far exceeded, is a reflection of how we found everyone there to be. Our server was especially helpful for our dinner selections and she was very attentive during the evening.\nI think it simple to sum up our experience. If you want a large chain menu and food, don't go here. If you want superb food with obviously hand picked fresh ingredients and expertly prepared dishes, don't go anywhere else. Max is terrific, the staff is terrific and our total experience was simply perfect. This unmistakably is a gem."

The foie gras was great, the duck succulent, and for dessert, sticky toffee pudding (not so French, but that's the beauty of being in London). Everything was reasonably priced, especially the house wine. My only complaint is that the pudding was a little dry."

I've been there three times now - it's a favourite romantic dinner date for my boyfriend and me - and will go there many more times, whenever I can come up with a good excuse!  One of the things I love the most is that even though the food is excellent and French, the atmosphere manages to be romantic without being pretentious.  The waiters keep an eye on you without making you feel like an uncultured heathen.  My biggest problem with it is there are always more things on the menu that I want than I can possibly consume!"

Had the slow roasted pork belly which was perfectly crispy, meaty and fatty all at the same time, although perhaps a bit too saucy.

That, unfortunately, Savoir Faire was not.

The food I received was thoroughly average.  The wine was potent and flowing, though, and the amount of time between courses was incredibly drawn out (and filled with more wine drinking).  So I wasn't entirely upset by the mediocrity of the meal at the time.  My fig and cheese starter was nothing special, and my fish main was overseasoned but cooked well.  I was too intoxicated by the time my dessert arrived to remember much about it.\nIn the end, I left with the impression that the courses were actually quite small for the price coupled with the inattentive execution of the dishes.  And I was kind of hungry."

    "review": "It is a tad unfair to review a French restaurant after spending a week driving around the south of France in a convertible gorging oneself on French food and wine, but that's the situation I find myself in.  One must persevere in such conditions, although I suspect the juxtaposition of eating in the south of France with eating in the middle of the tourist district of London is why my star rating is lower than others'.\nSavoir Faire is reasonably priced by London standards; 2 entrees, 2 mains, 1 dessert, and a carafe of house red cost under 50 quid.  I was underwhelmed by the food, however.  I had the beef carpaccio and the lamb shanks, and while both were fine, they weren't exactly screaming with flavor.  My co-eater had a tarte tatin for desert which was the least genuine tarte tatin I have ever seen in my life:  it looked like someone had taken apple sauce and placed it on top of pastry, and then covered the whole lot in custard.  Maybe it was designed for 80 year olds who had lost their teeth and couldn't chew?\nThere are some pluses though.  The cafe has a nice family feel and it was packed when I went which is always a good thing.  Also the waitresses actually spoke French which meant I could flirt with them in the language of love.  Normally waitresses in London speak Polish which I don't speak and is also the language of sausages, not love.\nOverall not bad and if you were going to the theatre and needed a quick dinner beforehand you wouldn't be disappointed.  I don't think I'd take a date here."

More like \"The last Family Guy season wasn't as funny as the others, was it?\" \nThe food was pretty good, but not up to what I had heard it could be. Although tasty enough, steaks were stringy and fatty. That lost a star from the review right there! I also felt that starters were lacking in portion size. Overall though, I did really enjoy myself, but that was probably due to the stellar company I was in! \nThe ambience was pretty good in the restaurant, but d\u00e9cor was a little rough in places. Service was pretty slow and inattentive, but to be fair, this was possibly because we were tucked out of the way in the basement, like a pack of grouchy live-in mother-in-laws. \nAll in all, I had a wonderful night, but that standard of Savoir Faire is more comparable to some of the 'Red Caf\u00e9' establishments around town, as opposed to being a newly discovered gem for me."

The ceasar salad was a staple and the stewed beef with mashed potatoes was perfectly savory. i LOVED!!!\nwe got one bottle of wine for about 17 quid, and entire dinner cost about 65 quid (tip included) so really affordable and delivers great taste for the cash.\nThe lowdown\n- there are two floors for dining: ground level and lower level. the restaurant is situated on a corner, so on the ground level you can do good people watching and have access to the bar. Lower level is cozy, dare I say romantic and the walls are adorned with oil murals of tasteful nudity and big mirrors here and there. \n- the bathrooms are cavernous and are truly tiny, but cute. To enter the women's restrooms there are literally 3 different doors. The only time i felt claustrophobic was in there.\n- there is NO music in the background. I didn't like that, and that is part of the reason why i took the 5th star out .\n- the crowd is diverse in terms of age, so don't expect to go there and find collegiates in mini skirts, but rather groups of people wanting to have a laid back conversation and a good time without having any use for background encouragement. \n- I suggest you go with your partner for a quiet night out, or with parents. not the place to go for loud fun.\nFOOD delicious!!! i will go back : ))"

This restaurant is like a breath of fresh country-air in the centre of a busy, bustling and let's be honest, slightly dirty city. Family owned and family run, this is a great slice of rustic French cuisine. \nI went here with a group of nine on a Friday night. Our table was ready, our waitress was superb and we were made to feel really welcome. The wine list was a hit with my partner (the aspiring amateur sommelier) and we kicked off the evening with a lovely Riesling from Alsace, called Rifile. This was so good (not too sweet, and perfectly balanced), and I even went to my parents local wine cavern Byrne's of Clitheroe, to find some more bottles of the stuff. Fab. \nI went for the foie gras - wonderfully rich and perfectly matched with the apple and brioche. For my main I went for the Sea Bass which was again, exquisitely cooked and the tomato and pepper sauce delicate and flavoursome. Between nine of us we hit most of the items on the 2 courses for \u00a316 deal. Bargain. Other highlights included the salmon gateaux and the rich duck dish. Yum. We were so relaxed we even took in some desserts and coffee. My friend even venturing to try some grappa!!!\nI did also venture into the small private dining area as I was intrigued by the murals. Now, I thought from previous reviews that the murals were hand painted BY Lautrec, now I'm no Art Historian, but they looked pretty new to be around 100 years old. So, I think they're probably a copy and homage at best. Still pretty though!\nQuite simply, Savoir Faire is great, fab and brilliant all at the same time. A perfect place to chill with friends whilst sampling some top notch French food. This isn't haute cuisine, but all portions are generous, tasty and definitely value for money. I'll be back in a flash, as soon as I persuade some more friends to go, judging by their emails the next day about how fab the food was, I don't think it will be long."

I've been several times, and have never been disappointed.\nMy first time there was with a group of 6 on a Friday night--we had no reservations and the entire lower ground floor was reserved for a party of 40. Rather than shoo us out, the friendly (understandably flustered) wait staff seated us in a cavern-like room behind the curtain, under the stairs. (My friends and I affectionately refer to this room as the lair.)   Because it was such a busy night, the kitchen was a bit slow, but we were kept happy with the well-priced (not so bad) carafes of house red (their old-fashioned pimms is also mixed quite well). \nThe food was (later I found out, always is) amazing--the lamb dishes and goat cheese appetizers are my favorites, and the desserts were wonderful (and good for sharing).   After we were finished, the waitresses (probably exhausted), let us sit for as long as we wanted to finish our wine. \nI would recommend this place to anyone--for a group, a date, or even by yourself because it's that freaking good."

(Let's just say that the singing candelabras named Lumiere and the les poissons loving chefs were absent from the experience.)\nHumble and unpretentious, Savoir Faire has been one of my favourite London dining experiences to date. Not because of fancy views or exquisite menus, but because these folks are living their dream and doing it authentically -- and that is beyond admirable. \nSavoir Faire is not a chain nor a franchise, but rather a 10-year old family run restaurant.  It was so family run that when I called for a reservation, I had to spell out the words \"E-i-g-h-t P-M\" so the French speaking host could decipher my American accent. \nEach table gets a basket of freshly baked bread, every menu item is made 100% in house, and they source only the best-wines-for the-money. In fact, the entire experience was quite affordable -- a two course meal for \u00a316 seemed like stealing.\nOn that note, I stole the grilled mushroom with melted mozzarella and roasted pepper AND the Nile perch with roasted garlic and lime beurre blanc. Others indulged in grilled mussels, pan fried foie gras, lacquered duck magret, treacle-glazed pork belly, wild boar and mushroom terrine ... it's agonizing typing this out because it makes me want to turn around and go right back. \nReally, the experience was perfect.

Don't get me wrong, she treats me right- it's me that has been the lazy one not putting the effort into our relationship. She give, give ,gives, telling me where all the best restaurants are and tracking my favourite reviewers. Like an ever faithful lover, she's always there when I walk in through the door at the end of the day, tired and emotional with no energy to type. And what do I do in return? Skim the cream of the crop for reviews before sneaking off to...watch TV! \nWell I'm a changed woman now. Savoir Faire has made me see the error of my ways. A restaurant this good needs to be Yelped with tender love and respect. Finding places like this is what made me fall for Yelp so hard in the first place and, it made me realise, I know we're meant to be together, through the good times and the bad...\nSo anyway, to the restaurant. Where to start? With the food? The incredible sweet cinnamon glazed duck breast with an oh so tiny cube of dauphinoise? Or the phenomenal (and pungent) mussels floating in garlic butter?\nOr maybe you'll get a better sense of Savoir Faire if I tell you about the wine. Our fruity Rioja was the hussy of vinos. She went with all of us, snogging us hard before leaving us desperate for more. For the second time in this review- I was in love (so I wear my heart on my sleeve!).\nIf I've left you in any doubt, Savoir Faire is an amazing restaurant. Everything about the place is as French as you could imagine, from the staff to the decor. Stunning Lautrec murals are painted across the walls in the back room and baskets of home made bread arrive at the tables with the minimum of fuss. The prices here are incredible too. Two courses of tasty, tasty French fare cost only \u00a316 and I am in no doubt that it was worth every penny. \nAfter this rambling review all that's left for me to say is Yelp, I'm sorry.

The cellar consists of the entrances to several former smuggling tunnels dug to take moonshine and stuff into Soho from outside the old city limits. These tunnels are mostly blocked now but the entrances make for wondereful private dining alcoves and each has been fitted with a large table and candlelight. If you are thinking of somewhere good to dine with a big group, then think no more - a private tunnel table at Savoir Faire is ideal.\nDid I mention yet that the walls of some of the alcoves are painted with murals by Toulouse Lautrec?\nOr how about that George Orwell used to come here to write his weekly Observer column?\nOn top of that location and history stuff, it's also an enjoyable meal. French food in London can run so ridiculously expensive for tiny portions with an astronomical wine list and snotty waiters - not here. The food is well-priced French classics, hearty yet elegant, the wine is carafe-served and affordable and the staff seem to be a decent bunch. It's like they want to break every stereotype for french restaurants.\nThe final bonus of this great find is that it's right close to The End and is a great place to start a big night out with friends."

In terms of the food alone, however, I wasn't all that impressed. The menu sounded promising, but I was actually disappointed with how the food turned out -- not that it was bad, it was just average to good at best -- not quite up there with the consistent 5-star reviews. My steak carpaccio was seared far too much; the sauces for the duck and the lamb tasted the same to me, the duck had too much fat and not enough crisp. Everything else was fine, but not spectacular.\nBottom line -- I like it, and it's definitely worth checking out, but doesn't quite go up there with my favorite places to eat in London."

The wine menu did present a bit more of a challenge than I would have expected with too many single grape new world wines but we were happy with our french bordeaux, young but a nice light taste that fit our fish and risotto.

I didn't really like the latter more than the usual types of mussel dishes but enjoyed the novel approach.  My husband was happy with his bouillabaisse.  My lamb shanks were very tender.  The tarte tartin was less tasty than others I have had, with a rather soggy bottom crust.  Overall it was a good experience with attentive service and reasonable prices.

Thinking we were in a cosmopolitan city like London, the rating meant a lot to us in selecting the restaurant.  We were very disappointed.\nWe started with the mussels which were grilled and then served with a pernod butter garlic sauce.  The mussels were the best of the dinner and we rated them a 7 on a 10 point scale.  Things went down hill quickly from there.\nThe second course was the warm goat cheese and fig salad on arugula (\"rocket\") bed.  It was mediocre, despite our high expectations.  It could have had more arugula which would have added to the experience, and fresher  rather than wilted.\nThe third (main course) was the Entrocote Steak Frites.  We ordered it medium rare.  It was cooked to the right temperature, but the steak was as tough as shoe leather, despite the chef pounding it for a long time before cooking it.  The french fries were okay.\nFor dessert, we had Vanoffee which was a pie with toffee and banana and whipped cream on a graham cracker shell.  It was good but not spectacular.\nThe service was pretty good and we had no complaints about the serve staff.  \nFinally, the ambiance was just fair.  No table cloths, paper napkins, etc.\nIn summary, Savoir Faire does not deserve more than a 2 star rating.  It is inexpensive, but very average."

    "review": "Cutest little french bistro in central London. Two of us were there for dinner on a Sunday night and it gets really busy so try and make a reservation ahead of time. Dinner comprised of a set menu of two courses with a range of options for the starter and mains. We had the grilled mussels and pan fried foie gras as our appetizers and they were both excellent. For our mains, we had the fillet of sea bass and the braised lamb shank. Although the lamb was good, the sea bass was definitely better - so good! Tried the creme brulee for dessert but I thought it was pretty average. There is also an extensive wine list to choose from. There can be a little bit of a wait for the food to arrive when the restaurant is really busy, but it's not excessively slow by any means. The food is excellent, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor is quirky and fun (there's writing on the ceiling!) and the service is friendly and efficient - definitely worth a visit."

    "review": "Interesting place. It's a great deal, particularly considering the location. The food's average-to-good, but definitely nothing to write home about - classic bistro cooking, the flaws being e.g. too tough beef bourguignon, lack of flavour in a couple of the dishes. However, a few things let it down. First, the service, while friendly, is slow and inattentive (whenever we needed one of the waiting staff, there was no-one to be seen and I spent more time than I liked trying to catch their eye). Second, the decor is basic but a few things need some touching up, and e.g. the cutlery/glassware look very much like they belong in a school canteen. Third, the wine selection is very ordinary, which is shame for a French restaurant - we had one of the more expensive bottles and, while inoffensive, it wasnt very interesting. I'll definitely bear it in mind for the future, but you won't find me going out of my way to come back, and especially not with a date or someone I'm trying to impress. There are much better restaurants in this kind of category (Comptoir Gascon instantly springs to mind, as does Le Mercury)."

    "review": "Well, it was our last night in London and we were looking for a suitable restaurant.  Being the Yelper that I am, I set about with researching.  We have some picky eaters in our group, so that added another element of difficulty.  As a bunch of Francophiles, I thought a French restaurant would be a good choice.  Based on the preceeding Yelp reviews, we finally settled on Savoir Faire.  I was intrigued by the basement grotto, so when I made the reservation on Open Table, I requested that we be seated down there.  This was good because we got a bit raucous and silly as the meal progressed.  \nWell, we were not disappointed by Savoir Faire in the least. We all ordered the two course, prix fixe menu.  I began with the roasted figs accompanied by stilton and prosciutto.  They were just lovely!  Then I tucked into the magret de carnard, but I felt that the duck was a bit over-cooked (Erin agreed).  I also had a nibble of Maeve's beef bourguignon.  Delicious!  The gnocchi that Courtney had was a bit odd looking, but she said it was good.  Chris and Miguel both had the Creole chicken and they cleaned their plates.  We also had about 5 bottles of some white wine (Chardonnay, I believe).  For desert we ordered a couple creme-brulees, the banoffee pie (my favorite!), and a very sad chocolate mousse (more like a pudding cup).  The wait-staff was nice, but we often felt a bit neglected at times. I guess that's what you get for hiding away in a cave.  The murals on the walls also provided some amusement for our group and some of them were pretty risque! Overall, a tres bon experience!"

We came in for a very late lunch and the owner (we presume) greeted us immediately, made a very good wine suggestion and defeated every stereotype of snooty French right away.  Our waitress was a bit cold, to be honest, and seemed irritated with us when she brought us the wrong wine...but really she wasn't RUDE, just not the smiley sort that another Yelper had mentioned.  We had steak with chips and salad...simple food that didn't seem entirely French in my mind, but was prepared so beautifully that I can't wait to go back.  Excellent value for money!"

We were a group of 3, there were a fair few tables empty and yet we were given a tight tiny table for 2. I refused such a bad table and was given a proper sized table.\nService was terrible, slow and quite frankly useless from start to end. \nAt an early evening booking, how do you run out of the rib eye steak? Or that there was no Sauvignon blanc by the glass? That's pretty poor.\nAnyway, had the tacos, nothing particularly special. A selection of sushi and sashimi, decent taste with the fish as expected, the rice in the sushi was not the best made, fell off too,easily.\nThe shrimp tempura was fine, but Zuma is another level, much nicer, they serve the whole shrimp in a much better batter. The asparagus tempura was fine, bit greasy, slightly too thick hence they were still a bit hard to break on the end pieces.\nI had ordered rice to come with the miso cod which was next. That rice never came so fish by itself, as tasty as the fish is, you need something else with it. Very disappointing.\nFinally the last course of tenderloin steak with rice finally. That was cooked rare perfectly and hat a spicy kick to it that worked. \nDessert was just green tea ice cream and petite fours. Was ok.\nAt the end they apologized for the slow/lacking service and gave the dessert free of charge but quite frankly \n, it shouldn't have been that bad.\nThe service needs to improve. Zuma will stay number 1 by miles in my book."

All sashimi was as fresh as could be and paired with a bottle of Brunello seemed to make everything taste even better. Wagyu is a must have and a recommended favorite! 5 stars for food, taste, and service. \nBe prepared to spend large when coming to Nobu.

We dont really put much importance on Valentines day, its more an excuse for a fancy dinner! However we did have high expectations in terms of food. I remember many moons ago being repeatedly told by a friend in Rome that Nobu was the best restaurant in London. I remember thinking it would take me quite a few years before being able to afford. Although ive been able to for a couple years now, never got round to it, so this was exciting stuff. \nI want to start by saying the food was amazing. Really absolutely fantastic - ill go into more details below. However, when you pay this much and when you go somewhere with such a reputation you expect more, much more. So lets beginning:\nAbsolutely no atmosphere, no vibe, nothing. This place has no soul. White walls, no decoration, nothing to excite you. Very bad very loud music, i guess thats what they might call \"atmosphere\", but you could barely hear yourself think and even less talk. Seats and tables were particularly uncomfortable. Lots of fancy people in fancy clothes but nothing else. Thats gotta be why it lost its star... Great food just isnt enough for michelin starred restaurants. You want an experience with insane food. \nService was decent considering it was Valentines Day and surely a particularly busy evening. \nThe food though... Thats another story, we had the Valentines Day 6 course menu, so didnt get to try the special and ph so famous black cod. However, i was not dissapointed with any ofthe dishes. They looked good and tasted good. Fancy japonese food at its best, combination of exciting flavours & luxury products (from a little caviar to classic lobster) cooked to perfection. Every dish was exceptional. Quick mention for the dessert, which i guess i expected less off. It was stunning, fresh & tasty. \nIf we look at the food alone, i highly recommend, i wodeven want to go again and again and again. However you cant ignore the price tag, ita not cheap obviously. For thatprice id want thw food to be outstanding but also the restaurant also the atmophere... So overall, if you are looking for amazing food i would recommend, but if you are looking for an experience out of this world i wouldnt recommend. Honestly im not sure ill be back.  \nHowever, super keen to try Zuma now!"

At other Nobu restaurants, dishes are served one by one so the guests can enjoy their dishes.

    "review": "I've heard the cuisine at Nobu described as 'new style' Japanese, but never truly understood what this meant until now. The food is in a class of it's own - absolutely phenomenal! The seafood and meats are of the highest quality, which alone makes the food stand out. Add to this perfectly balanced flavors and textures and it doesn't get any better. Dining at Nobu was a tasting experience that I'd best describe as 'blow your mind' good, which puts this meal on my 'best things I've eaten' list. \nEverything from food prep to service was also spot on. The quiet confidence of the sushi chefs along the counter expertly and precisely preparing each dish is an impressive sight. And the servers are also on their game, working together to quickly usher each order from the counter to the tables as soon as they are ready. We ordered a number of things to share and each dish arrived at our table with perfect timing. \nMy only small nit about the restaurant was the dome shaped ceiling design that resulted in some strange acoustics where we were seated. We could clearly hear the conversation of a table on the other side of the room. We ended up sliding our table over a few inches which seemed to dull the effect a little.\nI can't wait for the next occasion when I return to Nobu (perhaps to check out another of their famous locations). Until then, I have the following sweet memories...\nRun down of the dishes we ordered:\nJapanese Julep Cocktail - Got things started at the bar downstairs with this refreshing twist on a traditional julep made with Yamazaki whisky. \nCrispy Rice with Spicy Tuna - Fun presentation! Crunchy cubes of crispy rice on sticks that you dip in soy and add a scoop of spicy tuna before popping in your mouth. \nYellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - My favorite dish of the night simply because the sashimi was unbelievably fresh, some of the freshest yellowtail I've ever eaten.\nSoft Shell Crab Roll - These crispy crabs didn't disappoint. Crunch, crunch, yum. \nFresh Salmon Sashimi - Like butter. Need I say more?\nShitake Anti Cucho Peruvian Style Skewer - Surprising transformation of a simple mushroom. They nailed the flavors on this one. \nNew Style Wagu Sashimi - 2nd favorite dish of the night. Wagu melts in your mouth. Our friends ordered a different preparation of wagu sashimi, which was not as good. Definitely go for the 'new style' wagu!\n 'Dragon Eyes': Warm Chocolate and Zabayon Ganache served with Crema Catalana Ice Cream, Pistachio Garapinados and Mixed Berry Coulis - Ah, a happy ending \nWine: Riesling 'Dachsfilet' D.Q Prinz Von Hessen  2009 Rheingau, Germanya - Great pairing with our meal. So good, we ordered a second bottle."

    "review": "There's one thing you just have to know going into Nobu: it's expensive as all get out. Regardless of how much it costs to actually construct the dish, it will cost you an arm and a leg. It's kind of like Vegas, you just have to resolve yourself to a  certain \"sunk\" cost when you step inside. When you've made your peace with that, then you can make some smart choices to get the most enjoyment out of the 401k you gave up to eat there.\nIn terms of fish, I have to say that it's not the best, most flavorful, freshest fish I have ever tasted. Just like any other sushi joint, some days are better than others, and some cuts are better than others. Definitely ask what is best that day, because the sushi chefs will know. Remind yourself that you don't care about the price. The scallop has been very good, and of course you can rarely go wrong with Toro. Salmon is consistent but still not the best I've tasted.\nThe wagyu beef traditional style with two sauces is delicious. Sometimes you just can't beat a REALLY good cut of beef.\nThe hamachi and jalapeno starter is always a favorite of mine and Nobu does it to a standard almost worthy of the price.\nwhile miso glazed black cod isn't the most original of dishes anymore, it's still addictive, and just as flaky as you remember it the last time, every time. You will most likely never be disappointed ordering this.\nThe sashimi salads are also a great starter. I'm partial to salmon, but the tuna is also very good. The dressing is light and the greens are a really refreshing starter, especially when you've been eating nothing but heavy british food for awhile which I have been guilty of.\nThe rock shrimp tempura is a classic. The shrimp is meaty, the tempura is not too oily, and there's a lot of it. So it's good for larger parties.\nIn summary, I like going to Nobu because of the atmosphere and the service and just the overall feeling of luxury and being spoiled. Since the price is 5x more expensive than other places, is the quality 5x? meh, probably not. But like I said, if you are willing to put down the cash if only to guarantee a no hassle, relaxing, consistently delicious meal, Nobu will get the job done."

Salmon Tacos - MEH, it came with a \"spicy salsa\" which wasn't spicy... and the tacos were about the size of a pringle. -_-\n3. House Special Roll - Nothing out of the ordinary. Anyone can make this roll... just stuff salmon, tuna, and ebi into a roll and voila, you have Nobu's House Special Roll. \n4. Uni - Fresh, worth the 18 pounds it cost? Not sure.\n5. Ikura - Equally fresh\n6. Toro - Amazing\n7. Hamachi - Don't even bother.\n8. Mackerel - YUM.\n9. Dessert - Chocolate Bento Box - EHHHHHHHH. Whatevs. \nHOWEVER, I ordered a glass of Billcart-Salmon Rose - this was the best glass of rose I've ever had. If you are a big champagne drinker, do not pass this up !\nService was exceptional (after all this place has atleast 20 of them running around aimlessly)\nEven though my experience at this Nobu didnt meet my expectations, I'm still going to try the Los Angeles location but if I'm ever in London again, I doubt I'd come back."

Walked in without a reservation, and after a bit of schmoozing with the manager, got a table in the middle of the lounge.  Great ambiance there...a huge tree as a backsplash on the bar with lots of tea light candles.  The bar area got packed fast; not where you go for a romantic dinner...but perfect for dinner/drink pregame.  The tables are somewhat low and small, with cushiony backless curved seats, which was inviting for mingling on a busy Saturday.\nAmong amazing things to put in your mouth:\n-lobster ceviche, sea bass sashimi, softshell crab harumaki with wasabi, pumpkin tempura...and to chug: wash it all down with a green tea martini (okay fine, sip it.

The ambience is, of course, very elegant, and the dining area is perfectly laid out to keep conversations private while still giving you the chance to see and be seen.\nMy friends and I did the pre fixe tasting menus, and found that each option delivered a consistently excellent and balanced series of dishes, each crafted to deliver something different with each round.\nThe food was expertly plated, and despite European custom, the portions were actually quite large when added up.\nThe service was uncharacteristically friendly and attentive, though it seemed that each waiter was a little bit overworked.\nThe downstairs bar offers an interesting mix of ridiculously overpriced drinks, but there are some great features, like a mojito served with honey dripping from a honeycomb, and a nice selection of hard alcohol.  The lounge area is even louder and more crowded than the dining room, and if I had one complaint, it would be that they let too many people into the bar at any one time.\nAll in all, Nobu is a spendy evening, but given the quality of food, it's certainly not overpriced.  If you're thinking of going, plan ahead: Nobu is pretty much reservation-only and reservations open up 30 before the desired date.  Spots go fast."

Dudes in shirts unbuttoned to their navels looking like Tom Jones and ladies with their bits spilling all over. Wow. \nDad, I think he's going he's going to pork her. \nHe's not going to pork her, Russ. \nI think he's gonna. \nHe may pork her. \nThankfully, we were taken upstairs and had a great table. The food is fantastic and that is what I love here. The sushi is great here and we had the spicy tuna and California rolls. Solid. Rock shrimp with ponzu sauce, grilled octopus, and spicy shrimp ishiyaki. We get the rock shrimp every visit and you should too, it's one of the best things on the menu. Our other new choices were hits as well. The Uozo pie with the oatmeal cookie and dulce de leche ice cream was a nice ending. Service was good. \nNobu is always a great meal.

Not any better than any shrimp tempuras I've had and the lobster staring at us kind of freaked us out.\nSushi: yellowtail roll, shrimp tempura, and eel.

My sherry cherry had egg white in it (LOVE that) and my friend oooh'd and aaah'd over her lynchee martini.\nService: Our waiter was beyond patient with us as we took FOREVER to decide on what to order and quizzed him about celebrities he's seen at Nobu. He was extremely attractive too so made for good eye candy, although unfortunately for my single friend we were pretty sure he batted for the other side. \nCelebrities: No celebrities (besides us of course!) on that Sunday evening we happened to be at Nobu, but hottie waiter informed us that Brittney had just canceled a private party there for that week.

Plus, instead of mere seaweed paper, the exterior of their maki rolls comes wrapped in this white, powdery, reminiscent-of-raw-won-ton-paper-like-stuff that I find just a smidge off-putting... I guess I'm a traditionalist in this particular sushi sense.\nThe cocktails, however, are *amazing.*  Don't come here without ordering one!  I'm especially partial to their version of mojitos... and I never even got into to that mojitos-are-all-the-rage craze.  Be warned though, *all* their fruity concoctions are deceptively strong... one mojito, two mojito... awww...why not a third?  And before you know it you are drunkety drunk drunk.\nI should note that I've never once been impressed by the service here... sometimes nice, sometimes snooty or indifferent... but *always* slooooowww.  And I find the music just a touch too loud for decent conversation.\nThe lowdown?  If you have the money... you've probably already been here.

Berkeley Street is absolutely gorgeous though and you really do get the Michelin Star experience from the red carpet at the entrance right down to the immaculate toilets!\n The service was a little slow but the food is so exquisite that it hardly even matters - the whole atmosphere of the restaurant is relaxed and casual and I think it's nice that the service gives you time to relax and chat in between courses rather than a stiff-backed silver service which often makes for tense dining.\n I tried a completely different selection of food this time and as much as I can recommend the same old favourites, (the black cod and the bento box most popularly) I thoroughly enjoyed my yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos, mixed oysters and ginger cheesecake."

Of course, know what you're getting yourself into (I say this a lot): it's busy, loud, trendy and rather expensive... but it's fun and the food is delicious. I'm a fan - and definitely over the other Nobus in London.\nGet a drink at the bar first then sit down and order sushi, but also order some of the hot entrees. The black miso cod is a must, and the sea bass is a nice add-on. Ask the waiter about fresh specials - the fish is all very fresh but they usually have specials which shouldn't be missed!\nHave fun here - I miss it!"

Don't go in jeans and sneakers, you'll feel out of place. \nAs for the food, we tried some of the sushi (the yellowtail was fantastic) and the tempura (eggplant was ok, shitake mushroom, not so much). It was a fancy version of a tempura at other Japanese restaurants. We also tried the set dinners - my husband enjoyed his teriyaki salmon while I opted for the chicken in wasabi pepper sauce, which I was told was spicy. But instead, it was rather bland, for my liking, and left me wishing that I had ordered either more of the yellowtail sushi or the salmon like my husband. For dessert, we had the chocolate fondant with green tea ice-cream. The cake was good, but I would have preferred normal vanilla ice-cream instead. As we were celebrating my birthday, the chef did do a personalized \"happy birthday\" in icing around the plate...\nMost others were eating the set tasting menu and perhaps that's the way to go. But at \u00a380-95 a person, it better be a super special dinner! \nAll in all, it was a fun experience and I'd probably go back for more of the sushi..."

A co-worker and i just wanted to grab a bite at the bar and some drinks before we met some friends to go out for the night.  To be honest, the food was great (very fresh), and i would certainly go back for a full meal, but when we showed up it was a bit like trying to get in a club in vegas with 2 dudes...not going to work unless you have a 2:1 guy girl ratio.  \nAnyhow, we ended up sitting at the bar upstairs and had our sushi prepared right in front of us.  Food was great, but the drinks, just a vodka tonic w/ extra limes and splash of red bull, took nearly 15+ minutes.  I'm sure we didn't get the attention of our waiter because our bill was not going to be substantial, but come on, it could deter me from going back.  By the time i finished the first drink, we had to wait another 10 minutes to order again!  I mean I'm sure they are running a for-profit business, but it didn't feel like it.\nGiving 4-stars as the food was excellent, and the atmosphere was pretty cool."

    "review": "I had an Ex of mine take me here a few years after we broke up to make up for her dumping me. Does that make this Sympathy Dining? If so I want more, more, more! Any free meal is good but when it's at one of the most exclusive spots in town then it kind of makes up for all the heartbreak and stress... ok, now that I think about it, it doesn't at all. I should claim another free meal here.\nSo what can I say? I never would have seen myself dining here at this darling of the celebs, but she was paying and I wasn't saying no. I felt out of place in my H&M shirt and backpack from work, especially when she showed in a Chanel coat with a new 300 quid haircut. Fortunately though, the celebs on surrounding tables - some lady from ITV who wouldn't eat fish, the cute one from All Saints and the marvellous Goran Ivanisevic - all were dressed dowdy enough for me to fit in. Huzzah. I'm, a celeb... get me into here!\nThe food is wonderful, and for the price it's five-star outstanding when someone else is buying. We leant mostly on the Peru-side of Nobu's life, getting the crab tacos and the ceviche salad, but we did venture East to the Japanese connections. My ex was a regular at the Met's Nobu and knew what to get and how it compared to the best raw fish from her own home in the land the rising sun. The Wagyu beef with truffles and mushrooms was a dish I could eat every day. Sounds expensive doesn't it? You'd be surprised that it's not all that bad.\nMoving Mr. Nobu to one side, the culinary highlight came from the subcontinent of all places, when the Indian pastry chef (Kotesh Kumar Khandala) pulled out 2 of the most complicated and sublime desserts I've ever tasted, full of fantastic flavours like green tea and adzuki. If you go to Nobu for one thing and one thing only, forget the black cod... it's the pudding you want.\nThe only downside to a night at Nobu apart from having to consolidate your loans the next days, is that it is too much of a scene. The downstairs bar is choc-full of arrogant moneywinners in suits bleeding the country dry. It's a painful place to be and you kind of hope that they all order some mis-prepared Fugu. Invariably when people think of Nobu they think of ridiculous wealth and the world's best sushi - but don't - it's not all that exclusive and if anything the sushi is the weakest link, the other dishes are the real gems."

    "review": "I was once taken on a date here,which was great because I got to eat and drink my way through the menu without worrying about the cost, which was turning into a similar amount to my rent for the month. \nNobu Berkeley Square is probably the best Nobu in London, in terms of atmosphere. Plus it has a kick-ass bar, which is every bit as sleek and sexy as you would imagine from a mega expensive restaurant in Mayfair. If you are heading here, don't even think about missing the bar, as it does some of the best cocktails in London. My favourite is the goji berry martini - a frothy creamy concoction of berry deliciousness. The Nobu mojito comes a near second. And look out for any cocktails which have sake in them, yummy.\nSo the food, well we all have heard the reviews . It really is as good as the hype suggests. I'm not quite sure how a menu which is styled as a mix of Japanese and Peruvian actually works, but it does. Probably the most famous dish is the Black Cod. It is slightly sweet, ever so soft, and one of the best dishes that you can have in London.\nThe food is expensive, but there are ways of keeping the cost down. Listen up - on the back page is a list of all-inclusive meals. For about \u00a318.00 you can get a large bowl of chicken or prawn in teriyaki sauce with rice, and this comes with miso soup. The other thing to do is just order sushi. It is completely filling, and only about \u00a36 or \u00a37.00 for an hand cut roll. I could be completely happy here just sitting at the counter, sipping on a glass of wine, and having two or three plates of sushi. This would cost about \u00a325.00, so it's not all bad news for us penniless types."

However, unlike some other celeb haunts, this is a genuinely fantastic sushi restaurant that you simply have to visit.\nI went with a couple of friends and of course, we did make an extra effort with our attire and you never feel so bad if others see you wolfing down sushi as its healthy right? Anyhow, the food was so good that you can't help but gobble it all down - if you're not a fan of sushi they also serve some alternative fish dishes such as blackened cod which is possibly the best piece of fish I have ever tasted (and also the favourite of Lemar apparently). I had heard notorious things about this dish before I went and am so pleased I finally sampled it.\nThe food is extremely well presented and I didn't find the staff at all pretentious. We were treated in exactly the same manner as every other customer and he whole experience was fantastic.\nHowever, you may need to hold back on your eating out for a couple of weeks so save the pennies for Nobu as it is on the more pricey side at around - my main course was around \u00a332 so I decided against an appetiser! Well worth a visit though for something special."

We were here for lunch on Friday and had 5 pieces of Salmon sashimi with wasabi and soy sauce to start. It was great qualify fish. The main course dishes came at intervals after that, which worked quite well as if they had all arrived at the same time it would have been too hard to choose what to have first.\nI don't know exactly what we had as we let the clients choose, but first up was a mushroom based dish in a sauce, I couldn't say what else was in it but I've never enjoyed mushrooms on their own more. We also had lobster with asparagus, prawn with asparagus, pork belly and wagyu beef. All great but the pork belly was utter genius, melt in the mouth doesn't do it sufficient justice. I've had the black cod here before and that's the only other thing I remember coming close to the pork belly.\nFuji apple crumble came with peanut in the crumble mix and with hazelnut ice cream. It was very good but I think my taste buds had already been over-excited by that point"

This was also quite fortunate for my taste buds too as we were openly encouraged to order whatever we liked. This meant I was allowed to order their signature Black Cod, guilt free. It was phenomenal. Every flake fell away from the fish effortlessly and the taste was incredible.\nThe rest of my party thoroughly enjoyed their meals too and whilst it would be fair to say that there is a great emphasis on fish here, the meal lovers and vegetarians were also well catered for. Special mention has to be made of Nobu's skilled presentation. Every dish that you order arrives as a work of art in itself and it's clear that the kitchen are trying very hard to impress.\nThe downside of Nobu is the celebrity factor. A known haunt for famous faces, it often feels as though this restaurant is more concerned with status than food. While we ate it was hard not to notice a few celebrities being rushed through the dining room in to the private area at the back. If anything I felt this drew more attention to them than if they had just been walked through the restaurant like anyone else.\nFor most people a visit to Nobu will be a one off and for a special occasion it's definitely worth it. However, the prices here make it difficult for us non-celeb types to really get to know the place and its celebrity status can detract from the food."

Luckily, the bar staff is a little nicer. We ordered a carafe of red wine and dessert, which was not worth remembering the name. It was like a panda cotta with a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e top (torched sugar) which was unevenly torched, the middle too burnt and the sides left with raw sugar.

Balthazar (the restaurant proper) and their adjacent Boulangerie are stationed in bustling Covent Garden. The restaurant remains woefully out of my price range, so the bakery became my preferred haunt. Grab one of their canary-yellow boxes, load up on some heavenly carbs, and resist the urge to eat them until you arrive at your dining location. \nThe shop has great versatility - everything from fresh loaves of French bread (served with giant butter pats) to whimsical, fist-sized meringues. The bread is good stuff. Full stop. Soft, warm, and perfectly crisped. Grab a loaf, head to a market for some cured meats or lox, and make some causal tartines in a local park. I've never regretted doing so. \nMy favourite desserts were the chocolate hazelnut rocher and their lemon tart. Likely in my top 5 pastries ever consumed to date? The richness and texture of the rocher's mousse was remarkable. Think a Ferrero Rocher but ten times the size, softer, and far more rich. Needless to say, the first time I tried one I was back the next day for a repeat experience. As for the lemon tart it has a thick, eggy curd. Many tarts I've had in the US suffer from that artificial gelatine-based filling (you can't even really call it a curd), but Balthazar's tastes like true sugared lemon. Their oversized macarons - almost comparable in size to a hamburger - are adorable, but just a tad saccharine for my tastes. The flourless chocolate cake sphere was like pure cocoa magma and sensationally rich. It's heaven in there. \nDidn't know there's a sister location in NYC, so my mouth is watering at the prospect at having some Balthazar bread and sweeties within (conceivable) driving distance."

    "review": "I'd been meaning to go to the NY location for ages and was excited when my friend suggested we grab dinner here. We got here around 7 PM on Friday and there was no wait at all, perfect. Our server was super nice and patient! We hadn't seen each other for years so he let us catch up a bunch and was nice about the fact that we hadn't even opened our menus the first two times he came around. \nI had the Rocket and Spinach Agnolotti as an entree. Loved the bitterness of the arugula and the simple flavors worked well together. The hazelnut also added a nice tough. It seemed unnecessary oily though and felt heavy in my tummy. My friend and I then split the Creme Brulee. Good thing we did because it was massive. I enjoyed the sugary crust but the rest of it was just okay. It could've been creamier and more flavorful.  \nWe left around 10 PM and there were way more people than when we got here. Guessing it attracts the post-theater crowd. Good vibe and nice service, but mediocre food."

Only a 1 Star minus. Give it a try!"

We've eaten here before, as well as  dining at the original NYC location, and have always had a nice time and decent food. The scallops were a fine starter, and the onion soup was classic. Both Lamb and steak frites were tasty if perhaps unmemorable. Service is fine but can get a bit thin if the place fills up. We prefer to sit at the banquette tables overlooking all the action ( there wasn't much this visit ), though the padded seat is getting a bit lumpy. Many diners prefer the closer together tables in the middle of the classic bistro space. We have spotted the occasional celebrity here but most diners are having pre and post theatre dinners. \nGreat Covent Garden location."

    "review": "What a wonderful evening -- I owe virtually all of it to the wonderful barman who attended to me. The check says \"sam p\" was serving, so I'm going to say it was sam. \nFirst, he made an absolutely impeccable martini, and even paused to inquire about my preferred dryness. It was wonderful. I noted the wonderful lemon presence, and he cut a fresh lemon peel and squeezed it over the back of my hand to show me the freshness of lemon oils and the difference they make. Then, when I expressed an interest in the vermouth he used, he very enthusiastically shared their house blend (cocchio + standard dry). \nI mentioned I'd never heard of cocchio, and what followed was a tour de force of making a guest feel special -- he personally walked me through the different kinds of vermouth cocchio makes, their characteristics, their history, their relationship to other aperitifs like Lillet -- and then he gave me a taste of each. \nI mean, not only did I have a great time, enjoy a spectacular martini (and a perfect rare steak frites), but I actually learned something that I can bring home with me. \nI will consider my next trip to London incomplete without a visit to Balthazar for a drink with Sam. \nSam, you are a gentleman and a scholar. Thanks for a great evening!"

I was not sure about to order Le panier -selection of mini pastries and bread basket - he brought the basket to show us what we would receive.

The restaurant kept apologizing for the wait and were kind enough to offer a bottle of champagne while we waited for our table to clear out(bonus!).  I was just surprised and pleased in a way with the profuse apologies...Not used to it in America!

Get the burrata if you love cheese!! Even if you're lactose intolerant, I'd still highly recommend it ;) Don't let me forget to tell you about the fries. Omg. Actually, I take that back. I can't tell you. You just have to try it for yourself. You will seriously feel like you're being whisked away into the clouds while sitting on a bed of fries.

Bread lined the walls, the cakes on display looked ridiculously good - especially the donuts - and everyone (the staff) was speaking with a French accent! I still haven't sussed if they were real or fake accents yet...\nThe price for a soup and sandwich was costly (\u00a311!!) but at this moment SO worth it for a warming lunch having been out in the cold for so long. The French onion soup was everything a French onion soup should be and you could tell it had been stewing for quite some time. It also came with some large cheese croutons for dipping - a nice added bonus. Highly recommended.\nThen to my sandwich. I was actually rather full from my sandwich so I saved half for Jody but I must say it was a pretty decent sandwich - the bread, as with those hanging on the walls, was fresh and tasty and the fillings distributed well - no sandwich gaps, woo (big pet hate of mine)!\nI finally realised, after stuffing my face, that this was the cafe section of infamous Balthazar (which I am yet to visit)... Definitely worth a visit for a nice alternative to the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden and a much cheaper option than the main restaurant itself."

    "review": "Came here a few times, though the last time was certainly memorable. As my friend was visiting from abroad and wanted to book a fancy afternoon tea. After trying to balance showing her a good time and me not falling for my usual go-to's including Sanderson and Sketch, I decided to opt for their specialty Bobbi Brown themed experience, since my friend is a huge makeup fan. \nUsually I try to avoid too touristy cliche French Restaurants that attract people for 'impeccably luxury feel' service and overly prices carbs slapped with sauce on a plate. However Balthazar lives to it's reputation with good service and impeccably classic setting and dishes. The themed afternoon tea brings a little more 'edge' and quirkiness to their concept of elaborate dining. \nThe restaurant very much reminds me of Cheri in Barcelona. With cloudy yellow lighting to create intimacy, mirrored walls and monochrome marble floors give it that 'socialite' feeling of you being in an occasion spot in Paris in the 1920s. The formally dressed staff just add to the classic feeling of being served in something a bit more exciting than you typical urban bistro full of design enthusiasts with their macs. \nThe afternoon tea menu's included savory sandwiches with classic ones such as the cucumber, which is my guilty pleasure. The scones were nearly perfect with a lovely light and airy texture, sweet clotted vanilla team and classic blackberry jam. The highlight of the themed experience were the sweet pastries that were shaped in lips, eyeshadow palette and a mascara. My personal favourite was the yogurt mousse in the shape of lips. The rhubarbs shaped into an eyeshadow in a chocolate cream tart was also a close hit. \nOverall I think this afternoon tea is wonderful quality, considering the price with the perfect atmosphere of fancy dining and being a hot-spot in Soho. It's amazing if you're looking for something in central that offers the traditional afternoon with a themed twist, though nothing overly strange nor experimental. The unlimited offer of tea, cakes and sandwiches available also to take home was a big plus. The professional staff service and atmosphere makes this place a go-to for any fan of French cuisine."

I am thinking sea bream, bass, monkfish and halibut. Probably mackarel and tuna would be too strong and cloud the taste of the wine. The wine has also a very strong oak aroma and smoky bouquet that is not present in it's taste. I was glad otherwise it could all be a little too much. \nhot smoked duck with cherries, beetroot and braised lettuce accompanied with an Adelaide Hills Pinot Noir and cherry sauce served with Jacob's Creek Reserve Adelaide Hills Pinot Noir 2013 - with some serious buttered vegetables together with the layer of fat in the duck was, to some, delightful. I only managed one and had to take the other two off because it was just too much. The meat was a little tough and chewy but the intensity of the deep dark cherry sauce was very nice. The wine was easy to drink, very mild tannin that brought out the gameness in the duck.\nkangaroo with pepper, cabbage, pancetta and carrot with Barossa Shiraz sauce served with Jacob's Creek Reserve Barossa Shiraz 2013 - It was the best kangaroo meat I've had but I can only compare to Iceland supermarket's frozen kangaroo meat (there, I said it!) and I thought that it was a slightly unfair comparison so I referred to a true Aussie foodie that was there that night. She confirmed that it was very good indeed; so lean and cooked to perfection. It was good with the suggested Barossa but I thought that it was equally good with the Pinot Noir too.\ndark chocolate sphere with mint, eucalyptus and a hot chocolate sauce served with Jacob's Creek Reserve Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon 2011 - after seeing so many media videos of chocolate desserts melting when sauce is poured, this was my reality moment. But chocolate sphere did not entirely melt and the waiter was not going to wait for my silly phone camera to come on. Shame...\ntea, coffee and petit fours - macaroons, lemon meringue and chocolate were delicious. The cold coffee was not great but these petit fours, especially the lemon meringue, were delicious!

    "review": "Main reason for the mediocre review is I felt really rushed though my meal. I can appreciate wanting to ensure I made my show time (reservation at 6pm, show at 7:30), but still I had an appetizer and my main in front of me by 6:20pm... and that was after leisurely looking through the menu! Also, the restaurant itself gave a very cramped feeling. So much so the couple next to me and I commented on it.\nThe appetizer (octopus, tomato, basil) wasn't exactly flavorful. The main (stone bass) was more up to par with a delicious artichoke pur\u00e9e. \n \nThe bottle wine list was very extensive with plenty of French wine to choose from. The wines by the glass had reasonable selection.\nAll-in-all, I'd say a touch above average for this caliber of a restaurant. If someone brought me back here it'd be ok, but I would seek out another place for myself."

The place appears to have a perpetually long wait (unless you have reservations of course) but I got right in by sitting at the bar.  Wait staff was incredibly responsive (unlike many English restaurants where you have to flag them down).   Very highly recommend."

As I missed out on going to the SoHo restaurant while I was living in NYC, I redeemed myself (a little bit) by checking out Balthazar in Covent Garden.\nTo me, the interior is expectedly like an \"Americanized\" French brasserie, and the open dining space with many chatting diners/busy servers made the atmosphere very warm. We were lucky to get a table immediately on a Saturday early afternoon, followed by quick service.\nWe started with the chicken liver & foie gras mousse as starter. My friends described that it was smooth like cheese spread. We then proceeded with scrambled egg & cornish crab with a side of mushroom fricass\u00e9e, sweetcorn fritters, avocado on toast with poached eggs, and hazelnut waffles. All the entrees were delicious, and we devoured our dishes in no time.\nI am glad that I got my brunch fix."

We shared the pastry basket which had more pastries than we could eat. I had the caramelized grapefruit which I'd never tried before. The caramelization took any bite the red grapefruit ya have had, it was very good. The only problem I had in eating it was they didn't provide a grapefruit spoon to dig out the fruit with so it was something of a trial to eat. My friend had the full English breakfast which looked wonderful and she said was terrific. The hostess and wait staff were superb and we lacked for nothing, and didn't have to wait for them to assist unlike most places in Europe. This is not an inexpensive place for breakfast but the prices were reasonable considering what you receive and that London prices are very high anyway. Overall I highly recommend Balthazar's for breakfast or brunch. Next time I'm in London I plan to give it a try for dinner!"

    "review": "Another solid London brunch destination. It's a French brasserie, reminding me a lot of Colbert on Sloane Square and some of my favorite brunch places in the US (Parc in Philadelphia and Left Bank in San Jose, CA). The location could not be better (it is right off the Covent Garden Piazza), and the venue is grand and beautiful, with enormously high ceilings and loud jazz music playing throughout. We had a reservation for 2 people, which we managed to get by emailing the restaurant, despite no availability showing up on the online booking system. This is the second time that I've been able to get a reservation this way, so I would highly recommend it if your desired times are not showing up at first glance.\nThe food and service were also stellar. It was actually just like being back in America. I ordered scrambled eggs & Cornish crab, which came served on a piece of toasted sourdough bread and with a side of creme fraiche. The eggs were wonderfully creamy and the crab was plentiful and just perfect. I could not have been more pleased with it. One piece of toast doesn't seem like an awful lot, but I was so full by the end. My friend got the avocado on toast, but managed to switch out the poached eggs for mushrooms and tomato, since she doesn't really eat eggs. She also asked for some goat cheese, which the staff happily obliged, even though it isn't a standard menu item.\nI was very impressed by the whole experience. No complaints about Balthazar and would definitely come again... the rest of their menu looks equally amazing."

Sadly nothing special, overpriced and overrated. I could definitely think of better places for brunch in London."

    "review": "It is a pleasure to review a restaurant like Balthazar.  In a nutshell, the food is excellent and the service is impeccable.\nHere are the details:\n- Bread - I simply have to start with Balthazar's homemade bread. Every single kind of their bread is spectacular, but I'd like to single out the sun dried tomato olive buns.  5 stars all the way. (Btw, their butter is great too).\n- French Onion Soup - very good. Savory, beefy and with a healthy amount of gryere, very intense.  One minus - too much bread in the actual soup, which sucks up a lot of the liquid, making the soup a little dryer than I'd like to.  That said, still a solid 4.5 star dish.\n- Escargots - very good, garlicky, buttery and just yummy.  5 stars.\n- Garlic Shrimp - the shrimp is good, but the sauce it comes in is out of this world.  It has a slight kick due to the addition of chili peppers.  5 stars.\n- Mac & Cheese.  Very creamy and not as intense as I expected it to be.  Made with gryere. It deserves 4.5 stars, and the reason I'm not giving it full 5 stars is because it was the least memorable dish I had.\n- Burgers - Very good burger, cooked to a perfect medium rare but not the best burger (not even in the vicinity) I ever had.  The meat was excellent quality but underseasoned.  Two other major issues: 1. Bun - too big and 2. the patty is on the smaller side.  For that size of the bun, the beef patty has to be at least twice that size. 4 stars.\n- Beef Tartare - Excellent! Prepared \"au couteau\" (hand cut), well seasoned with the slightly higher note of acidity.  Add some hot sauce a freshly ground black pepper for a heavenly concoction. 5 stars.\n- Moules Mariniere (mussels) - great.  Fresh and fenomenal. 5 stars.\n- Rubharb Souffle - WOW! With a side of creme anglaise this was the home run of the evening. 5stars and it doesn't do it justice.\n- Small dessert pastries - every single one was better than the other.  The macrons, the cream filled dark chocolate  and the chocolate filled cookie cups. 5 stars!\nI hope you'll enjoy Balthazar as much as I did."

    "review": "You know, I expected it to be better, much better.\nI've been to the one in NYC and it is an institution so was looking forward to trying the London version of this cosmopolitan French styled bistro. It looks very much like the one in downtown New York, but much bigger and along with that it loses some of its intimacy. What was imported across the pond was a good helping of New York type attitude. The service was a bit cold and always seemed to be bored with whatever was said or asked for. Our waitress could barely be bothered to help with the wine when I asked if they had a Bordeaux by the glass she seemed confused. There also seemed to be the bare minimum of interest shown while just getting the job done properly. \nThe food was good but not amazing. You would think that a pretty straight forward Steak Frites with Bearnaise would be delicious in a place like this.  It was fine, but lack luster. Starting with the meat which was not cooked the way asked more medium than medium rare, and also not the best cut of meat. The Bearnaise was a bit thin and vinegar-y, overall just a bit off and not what you would expect. Dessert of Tarte Tartin was delicious though.\nNice enough, and for Covent Garden Piazza a bit of an oasis if you want something a bit more upmarket. The bar makes a great place for pre opera drinks."

Oysters were fresh - no complaints. I do wish the bread they served prior was freshly baked...\nI asked for a recommendation for my main, and oh boy! My waiter recommended the plate du jour, which was vaguely described to me as pork belly. I do love a good pork belly so I went along with it. Goodness gracious me! The pork belly arrived, on a bed of poached greens, with the skin crispy and slightly sweet, and there was additional pork crackling on top, and blood pudding on the side. They didn't forget a sauce, and to go with all that goodness, pur\u00e9ed apple was hiding somewhere to complement the pork perfectly. Despite the sheer amount of pork elements on the plate, it wasn't overly porky and there was a lot of difference within these elements to wow me. Party in my mouth, it was. \nLoads of places can do a decent pork belly. But not many places can combine it with other pork elements, and do the classic pork and apple combination to a T. I didn't get dessert because I was stuffed, but I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here."

Service is attentive but the waiters are particular about their respective areas so you can't call on a different waiter even if yours is busy.\nWe went here for lunch: grilled salmon on warm spinach, walnut and lentil salad; club sandwich with frites; basket of warm fresh bread. All delicious and fairly large portions. Very quick to bring to the table. Maybe we didn't order the right things but they weren't particularly special. The chips were very bright yellow which made me the think the oil may not have been the best. I enjoyed the club sandwich despite it falling apart in my hands because of the soft French sourdough loaf bread used. Two lunch mains for \u00a338 is a bit steep but good if you're in the area and looking for somewhere fairly refined to eat."

Bustling with energy.\nService: You felt a good vibe as soon as you walk into the door.  Everyone from the hostess, the bartender, and to our server was friendly and attentive.  One of the guys dropped a few plates at our table and about five different people came to apologise.  They brought us two glasses of champagne which I thought was a nice gesture for the broken plates.\nWould I go back?  Definitely, especially for the escargots.

So i do recommend to get a table booking. Was it worth it? Well I wouldnt do it again but since it is one of those place I have been wanting to try ever since it open then of course it was worth it for the first time!\nAs a French brasserie you will find steak, French onion soup and one of my favourite Escargots. There are not many places in London that I have tried that does it well. Balthazer escargots was nice and better than other place. But it just does not compare with ones I had at Galvin bistrot de luxe which comes in a wonderful garlic butter sauce that you want to scoop off with bread.\nBalthazar serves two different pie including a duck pie which is very rich in flavour. The one I recommend and the dish that I give a big thumb up has to be the Fish Pie. This was true comfort food and an indulgent to have for dinner. It has to be my best fish pie I have had in London.\nYou can not leave with out ordering the souffl\u00e9s. It is \u00a310 each but they are big enough to share between two people. The waiter who was serving was friendly and a laugh. Even before our souffl\u00e9s arrive he explain how to eat it - make an indentation at the top and pour the creme in to it. Then you ready to enjoy a light raspberry souffl\u00e9. I have to say that this was the only reason I have been wanting to visit Balthazar!\nFish Pie and Souffl\u00e9s is what I would want to visit Balthazar! Delicious!"

I opted for the eggs royale but was told by the chef via a waiter that it contained alcohol which i'm allergic to. I was told the chef would try to create a sauce but it didn't go well - again, i was told. I honestly tried the dish and it tasted dry as it needed hollandaise sauce to give it that special oomph. My friends could see my distress and garnered the attention of a staff and I was given the menu to make a whole new order. I opted for the \"avocado and eggs\" dish as recommended by the chef.

The gruyere  cheese was bubbling and browned and when my spoon broke through its lovely surface, a flavorful (but not at all salty) broth with plentiful onions and bread awaited. I would have been satisfied eating just this, but I had to try the steak friites, which also did not disappoint. Fries did not overwhelm me, I must confess. They were a little undercooked and not seasoned enough, but the steak itself was fantastic.\nOf note was also the side of green beans with shallots. I devoured them with the steak. They were the perfect accompaniment to the steak.\nWe did not save room for dessert but the plates looked great we saw going to other tables.\nLondon has definitely become more of a destination for dining in recent years and this restaurant is one that helped to turn the tide.

A few months ago, I read a rather interesting article about the New York company and ever since wanted to gain some first-hand experience. Usually, Balthazar was always very busy when I considered visiting, but on this late Sunday afternoon, it was easy to secure a table.\nSupposedly, the London branch is almost a 1:1 copy of the New York venture. I cannot  verify this, but I can tell you that the main dining room is huge and grand, with heigh ceiling and some vintage coolness. The rose-inspired lamps hanging everywhere are cute, while also pretty kitschy. And in case you want to know, the toilets are beautiful, too.\nI started my late lunch with a lemonade. And what a lemonade! It was kind of a bespoke service, freshly pressed and delivered with a supply of cold water, like a do-it-yourself drink where I could decide how much water or sugar I wanted to add. The waiter was overly friendly and I instantly liked the place after this great start. He and his colleagues continued to impress by topping up my water seamlessly throughout my stay.\nI went for the cheese burger with fries and crispy bacon. It was a mighty and pretty messy beast. After I had removed the tomato, the gherkin and the onion, the burger became much more compact and shrank down to a size I could handle. Still messy, but manageably messy.\nInitially, I wondered why I was offered no condiments. As I ate my way through the massive burger, I noticed that all kinds of delicious juices  and sauces were oozing out and my plate quickly became the right place to dip my fries, no need for additional condiments. \nThe fries also deserve a separate mention. The thin-cut potato strips were golden, crispy, superbly spiced and overall delicious.\nTo complete my meal, I ordered the profiteroles. This dessert was surprisingly big, packed with lots of ice cream and a dark, strong chocolate sauce.\nAfter all this food, I felt really full and decided to do something about this and concluded my visit with a coffee. I was happy when I learnt that they use Monmouth coffee - a staple choice in the London coffee landscape, and they are almost neighbours in Covent Garden. \nI must say, that I was very satisfied with the food and service at Balthazar in London. Really a place I can recommend, even though the location makes it come across as a tourist trap."

When greeted at the door our jaws dropped and we were impressed at the likeness of the NYC look and feel. The gentleman host said to me the only difference you'll see is outside there are black cabs instead of yellow ones and then he offered to paint one yellow... now that's service. LOL\nOn 2 March we were transported to a mini-NYC at Balthazar after tapping redial 24 times we were about to feast! I can appreciate my fellow yelper, Kate H.'s experience of 137 attempts to get a table. I realized I needed to modify the reservation which resulted in 67 calls. CRAZY but this was a must-try for myself and some special New Yorker friends.\nEverything was great and aside from a few opening hiccups (all places go through them) the staff gave us a great night. I started off with the winter kale salad followed by the linguini \"Fruits De MeR\" and both were quite good. There were 8 of us and we had two reservations since they were only taking a max of 6 per table. The staff was so kind to try and seat us close together however we ended up with a round table and managed to get everyone seated cozily in the same place. There were many great dishes served up at our table, rock oysters, salad ni\u00e7oise, c\u00f4te de boeuf, duck and stone bass. One person's only minor complaint was the stone bass was already deboned. (personally I find that a bonus) However he prefers to demonstrate his skills of removing it as one piece before enjoying and like I said minor thing. Each person said they enjoyed their meal and would recommend it.\nDue to the newness of everything serving times were a tiny bit delayed but when you have great company it doesn't get noticed as much. So after bottles of champagne, red wine, fabulous food and yes, dessert followed by dessert wine our time at Balthazar came to a close. The restaurant is beautiful and the food was very good. I'm sure with time their service and delivery times will improve. One of the managers was kind enough to drop by and chat with us. She was visiting from the NYC restaurant and helping get London on track. I look forward to my next dining experience at Balthazar and I'm almost certain you'll enjoy it as well.

I met two friends with whom I had been the NY version - just so we could compare notes! \nWalking in, I thought I was back in New York. It is almost identical! \nI had the snails to start with - they were delicious (well, they were unbelievably garlicky - which is about all you want from snails really). I actually swapped a snail or two for a couple of my friend's oysters - also really really scrummy (the oysters, not my friend. although she is pretty hot to be fair). I then followed up with Chicken Paillard, which was damn near perfect. \nYou know what I like most about Balthazar though? It's French cuisine, in London, run by Americans. This means that the food is exquisite, I can get to it without boarding a plane or an international train and the service is bloody excellent. Really, they can't do enough for you - which is such a pleasant change when ordering French food!"

    "review": "This is a fancy food factory. The dining room is quite nice, but there are two main problems with this place:\n1) The service: everything goes too fast. It is very clear that they have been instructed to get as many seatings in as possible. You barely get to sit down before someone is there to take your order, the main course comes directly after the first course, and they start clearing the table before you have finished. That being said, the staff are all very nice.\n2) The food: I got a steak which wasn't bad, but not something very good either. The chips which came as a side was like McDonald's chips with less salt. An with that came a bernaise sauce which isn't really worth mentioning.\nI have had far worse dining experiences, but it doesn't change the fact that this is tourist trap although of the better kind."

But alas. This was the real deal.\nMy partner booked us a spot for my Sunday Birthday lunch here. We received a perfect corner table tucked in, in the middle of the restaurant - a perfectly romantic setting.\nDespite the restaurant being full - of families, couples, etc. the acoustics were great and it was easy to carry on a conversation. From a service perspective, everyone was really attentive, providing space to enjoy our meal but always coming over to keep the champagne flowing.\nFor food, my partner went for the eggs benedict and I opted for the eggs norwegian. We shared escargot to start. The eggs were made absolutely perfect, in fact I'm now convinced that almost every other brunch place I've ever been to needs a lesson on \"how to make the proper egg\".  Once our plates were delivered, we opted to have some bread from the bakery with our meal (as opposed to the basket which just seemed like too much food with everything else) - and yes, save space for the bread if you want a little taste of France with your meal.\nThe escargot in garlic butter was pretty much one of the best starters I've ever tried. I've attempted to now order it (thinking it was my new thing) at other restaurants since, but nothing has compared. Highly recommended even if you don't fancy yourself and escargot eater, or are trying it for the first time (though be warned...it will never be the same after). \nIn short, make a special occasion with someone special and go!"

You get that French Bistro feel as soon as you walk into the restaurant. They have a lovely display of fresh seafood: lobsters, crabs, shrimps and, of course, oysters. \nThe menu here is big and quite French, so if you are in the mood for steak tartare, escargots, duck and steak and frites, you have come to the right place. Since the restaurant is in London, you can also have some British flair, like a duck shepherd's pie. We must not forget the daily specials. The evening we went was a Sunday, so I went for the ox cheek bourguignon, because the server highly recommended it to me. It was adequate but not great. The sauce was way too heavy and instead of the flavor Burgundy wine, I just tasted salt. However, the meat was well cooked. I think next time I will not ask for the waiter's recommendation and just stick with steak and frites."

The food is of a high standard - the duck confit was as good as we have sampled in France.  The afternoon tea was good value at \u00a325 compared to the high end hotels such as the Ritz or Claridges; scones were delightful and the patisseries beautifully presented. The sandwiches were rather average and dry though.\nDuring the day, the venue is casual enough for children however the acoustics of the room means it gets very noisy. There were large groups of ladies-who-lunch, sipping their tea and we felt slightly out of place in the grand settings.  Highchairs available, tables a little tightly packed to house buggies.

I was not let down either.\nThe only blip was slightly slow service between the starters and entrees otherwise, this is a solid 4 star place.\nThey have managed to capture the NYC buzz within the restaurant, likely courtesy of it being in the middle of tourist central or as I also suspect, it's the damn good food and service in here.\nThis is an exact replica of the NYC original and we were seated promptly. I needed to try the Escargot since it's been a while since I had them - queue NYC Balthazar. DELISH!! They were so lovely, I thought each was cooked individually - not one chewy mollusk in the bunch.\nOnto the scallop & courgette risotto...creamy, morish goodness. The scallops were melt in your mouth goodness. The vodka cocktail washed all of  it down nicely.\nMy mates had a variety of dishes and all were tucking in heartily too. Not an empty or unsatisfied stomach among us.

I've spent time in the original Balthazar and had some lovely lunches but, especially in a white hot, can't get a table for love nor money, opening period, I'd resigned myself to forgetting about the London branch. And anyway, who really wants to go to the London branch of a slavish New York recreation of a traditional French bistro? I could be on the Eurostar before they'd answered the reservations line.\nAs it goes, it's reasonably quiet, even on a Thursday lunch, and therefore the perfect spot to slide into a banquette opposite the International Man of Mystery. He's never sure which city he's in at any given point in time, so this level of high class generic internationalism is perfect for him.\nIt's not cheap, their range of French classics, but if you've come here deliberately you know that and are comfortable paying \u00a324 for a plate of Steak Frites and \u00a317 for a burger. If you're a wall-eyed tourist who has just stumbled across its prime Covent Garden location then congratulations. You're going to be fleeced, but in a much more pleasant way than if you'd wound up in the Angus Steak House.\nGet a back wall booth if you can, perfect for people watching amidst the monied buzz and much, much more room than on the cramped banquettes filling the centre of the room.\nAfter being spoilt by their homemade bread, the ceviche starter was utterly underwhelming, a few rings of squid or octopus in a vinegary coleslaw of mandolined bell peppers and onion. From a distance it looked perfectly pleasant, but ended up being pushed around the plate.\nConfit duck on the other hand was perfect. Rich and unctuous, it fell off the bone like a dark brown silk dressing gown sliding from a dressmakers dummy. Definitely a contender for comfort dish of the year, though at the price it bloody well should be.\nIt's a lovely cavernous space, with decent food slightly over-assiduous staff (that'll be the New York influences rather than the French) but for the money, the ambience and the attitude, I'd much rather be in Zedel, sucking down champagne with the money I've saved on my steak. If it's a power lunch that I need, then I'll be back at the Wolesley first."

    "review": "Went for Saturday brunch.\nCoffee was great, but my meal was blas\u00e9.  No one else at my table seemed to be all that jazzed about their meals, either.  I ordered the New York pancakes and, to be clear, these pancakes are not 'New York' pancakes, nor is there any such thing, for that matter.  They are, perhaps, an attempt at American-style pancakes, but that's about it.  In any event, this New Yorker who arrived with an appetite for some heavenly pancakes wasn't impressed with the effort.  Folks who enjoy more of a Dutch-style pancake (mmmm, lekker!), for example, would also be greatly disappointed in this effort.  They just weren't good pancakes in any regard.  Fairly decent pancakes are just so easy that to get them all wrong speaks volumes of a restaurant's kitchen.  \nI also ordered a side of scrambled eggs, and the eggs arrived barely above room temperature and, as with the pancakes, were fairly bland and disappointing.  Again, eggs are not astrophysics in the world of culinary arts, so c'mon Balthazar.  Get it together.\nAs a side note, I'm really tired of these otherwise fabulous U.S. restaurants and businesses (Balthazar, Shake Shack, Whole Foods) opening up spots in London, getting a ton of business from their reputation in the U.S., but then half-@ssing it over here in the UK and getting away with serving sub-par dishes that would make most of the kids back in the States grimace, and certainly the New York crowd.\nIn sum, Balthazar London is just no match for the New York location, and not even close.  In fact, I don't think that Balthazar would have ever made a name for itself if the dishes flying out of its New York kitchen were as boring as those at its London location.  Such a shame."

While the look and feel of the restaurant is similar to the original in NYC, it's lacking a little something that I can't quite put my finger on.   While the food is nice, it can be a little bland - the burger for example, at \u00a317 you'd hope for something with a little more pizzazz. But it's a cute little stop off if you fancy grabbing a coffee and one of their lovely pastries. You can sit in a little area by the bar, do some people watching, not break the bank.   The real winner here is the bread & desserts (not at the same time) - which I know may sound odd, but it's certainly one to try. The Pavlova is lovely."

Bf's Balthazar Bar Steak (16 quid) was tender and juicy, my 22 quid bouillabaisse (a special only on Friday) was delicious, but it's definitely more of a place to be seen and checked out, rather than a place you'd go for your anniversary.\nDo, however, get the 10 quid raspberry souffle, even if it takes 10 minutes to make.

I was not disappointed. In fact, I was exuberantly delighted to sample their twist on a classic croque monsieur [soused in b\u00e9chamel-sauce finished with Lea-and-Perrins lacerations]- the textural experience was sumptuously akin to that initial and rather glorious creme-caramel fracturing moment. I'm afraid biting through the crispy, grilled bread surface into the soft layering of jambon et fromage interior, is simply worth the excessive \u00a34.50 it demands.\nBien s\u00fbr, the usual boulangerie window-pageant of baked goods is certainly inviting, and the gleaming white-tiled walls bedecked with cursive 'B'-inscribed wholemeal loaves exude a constructed charm one only thought possible in a Hollywood studio (you have ACTUALLY been to Paris, yah). Though I would even be so bold as to suggest that the B-B London even trumps its NYC predecessor in terms of the open space and ability to convince its patrons that they are actually there to shop (market-style) rather than just queuing for a costly caffeine and butter-filled petit d\u00e9jeuner, distributed in a somewhat nonchalant and brusque manner (although that would probably be the most authentically French thing about it).\nBon appetit, comrades."

And with much fanfare and panache, the will-he-won't-he speculation finally ended last Monday evening. They're currently only open for dinner service, but brunch and lunch service is coming soon. \nAfter 137 tries (thanks, iPhone for keeping track) to get through the booking line last Friday morning, my fortitude was rewarded with an opening week dinner spot. So, last night we sat down for an early-ish dinner, that is very much what I remember from back home. \nThe staff is an eclectic mix of London's restaurant service elite; NYC Balthazar linchpins; and an eclectic mix of French servers representing the best of The Hexagon's diverse regions. It's an impressive bunch! \nThe American hospitality smacks you in the face as soon as you walk through the door. At first blush, it can be a bit much for those of us used to the cold shoulder presented at so many London establishments. But we acclimated almost immediately--it sort of made me miss home. Sigh.\nWater appeared via busboy -- what!?. Our Breton waiter brought us expertly made cocktails (Brian and Tom were both poached from other top London cocktail establishments). Fine de Claires on-the-half-shell were ordered and brought in a flash. Briny and fresh, I was in heaven. Bread from their boulangerie next door was devoured with French butter (of course). \nI started with the onion soup, which was unctuous and just a little bit sweet. The hubs had a small portion of the beef tartare, which he figures is some of the best he's ever eaten--and he eats it a lot. Another member of the waitstaff recommended a bottle of red from the Jura, her home turf, that was one of the more interesting bottles of wine I've ever had. Slightly effervescent and light in color, it takes a couple of sips to fall in love, but amazing once you get there.\nIt accompanied the whole chicken for two very well. The chicken itself was roasted to perfection and served with jus, a mix of veg, and velvety potato puree. By this point we were stuffed to the gills, but dessert was needed--for research purposes obviously. I ordered the tart du jour, lemon with a raspberry reduction. Lemon tart is my Achilles heel as of late, and this one was very good. Although, it was more of a lemon mousse with crust, than a lemon tart. Even so, still delicious! My partner in crime had the cheesecake. It was a small portion, but it was so rich, there was no reason for more than they served. He nearly licked the plate clean. \nMy only complaint at this point is the timing is a bit off. The coffee came before we had finished our dessert, and after presenting us with the whole chicken, it went back into the kitchen for plating for what seemed like an eternity; I think it was actually more like 15 minutes in human time. But it's their first week, so I imagine things will get smoother with time. \nFor those of you who've fallen for the New York Balthazar, you'll recognize the room as an almost exact replica. Other brilliant American aspects include walk-in seating at the bar, the seafood tower, and a true New Yawka working the door. Did I mention the busboys? Oh, and how could I forget? It's reasonably priced; I mean, for Central London anyway.\nYes, as my husband said, it seems like the universe is finally throwing us a bone on the London dining scene. I think a standing weekend reservation may be in order."

The sauce was rich with the aroma of prawn and fish; very moreish! I then moved on to the steak frites but I found the sirloin a bit tough. I had someone else's fillet and that was perfectly seasoned and tender. Don't go for the house sparkling white unless you prefer it less brut. The champagne was much better. We also had a Pinot noir which was excellent. I had a brilliant evening in this vibrant and buzzy restaurant. Truly I can't wait to go back!"

This isn't a 'let's wander around Covent Garden and see what we find' kind of place, but once you're in, you'll be glad you did. \nThe service is very American, which is lovely and refreshing at times, it's nice to be a bit catered to by an army of staff. The decor, like everyone has noted, is a replica of the NY one with loads of French charm. We did a brunch and aside from one of the best bloody marys I've had, the food was pretty epic. An eggs benedict that will not leave you feeling peckish afterwards.. oysters, baked mac & cheese, souffl\u00e9... you can easily go overboard with the decadence meter but you'll have to do it sometime, no?\nThere's a bakery attached where you can take away some of the tempting sweets and fresh breads. It's a must stop for anyone that loves eating, you'll agonize over what to order and end up getting the entire menu like we did. It's not totally overpriced either, for what you get it's actually quite reasonable."

Had read negative professional reviews in the papers and was hesitant to try it, but so glad I took the plunge.\nPros: Lovely ambiance (similar to Delaunay), excellent front of house staff, excellent waitstaff. Asked to have table changed during a busy lunch hour as wanted more privacy for a lunch meeting and was accommodated immediately and gracefully. \nPlats du jour are an excellent deal. Food is consistent, menu is varied, pricing very reasonable for quality of food. Balthazar house salad had just the perfect touch of truffle oil and seasonal ingredients. Mains are superb. Even the bread basket offers a step up from the standard dry baguette that one finds elsewhere. And the takeaway bakery next door is charming.\nCons: Forced to come up with something, simply that there can be a bit of wait it seems others have discovered this gem as well!"

All booked up.\nJust so happens we had tickets for Charlie and the chocolate factory at Drury Lane on Thursday. 7.30 kick off. Balthazar right outside. Why not try a pre-theatre raid.\nA 6pm table of 3 was duly booked. We got there on time and the place was already busy. The bar was full and three quarters of the tales were taken. Bags were swiftly taken and we were at our table.\nBalthazar London feels exactly the same as New York. Loud. Thronging. hot. Nicely decked out in authentic French brasserie tiling and furniture. Serving staff whizz round all over the gaff and there is a big seafood bar at the back to whet the appetite. This is proper tourist London stuff, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Slap bang in the middle of covent garden and full of hip things out for a good time. It feels great.\nThe menu is what you'd expect from a good French brasserie. Nice bread arrived to munch on, plenty of it. Followed by a good moules et frites which was lifted by the inclusion of caramelised fennel. The boy had macaroni cheese sans the bacon and the missus had a skirt steak that was full of taste. \nMy chip were a little soggy was my only complaint on the food. But it was pretty expensive for what we got I thought.\nHowever, you're paying for the great atmosphere, not the food. And for a bit of a treat if you're painting good old London Town red, it's definitely got it. Go there and show out. It's fun. Not perfect food and a bit pricey but great fun nonetheless. Not quite a 4 but a high 3 stars well earned.\nNb If I did theatre reviews I Would give Charlie and the chocolate factory 6 stars. It was truly brilliant. And I hate the theatre.  Book it. And try Balthazar before for a proper night out!\nThe place was heaving by the time we left at 7. So do book."

Balthazar, which looks and feels identical to her sibling across the Atlantic, fits this niche perfectly. The food is well executed (the Huevos Rancheros were delicious during my visit this weekend), the staff attentive, the room well decorated, the sound level loud without being deafening.

    "review": "We booked Balthazar for a pre-theatre supper on my birthday. First impressions were great as we arrived early to have drinks at the busy bar. It had a buzzy atmosphere at 5pm and we ordered drinks whilst we waited for our table. I had an Aperol spritz which was watery and rather expensive for 9.50 but we perused the menu which sounded good and got shown to a nice corner table. This is where it all started to unravel. The wine list is ludicrously expensive and we ordered two half bottles as the house wines did not appeal. I ordered saffron risotto to start which had 1.1/2 (!) scallops on the top. It arrived with a skin on it so had either been sat waiting to be served or had been microwaved to high heaven. My boyfriend's game pate was not pate, more like a thick over seasoned terrine. Bread was a little stale and butter ice cold. My main was 1/2 a lobster which arrived served on a bed of ice with no fork or cracker to open it. Every time I tried to get some flesh out it was submerged in a slushy, icy bath and it felt like I got an 1/8 of a lobster! Pretty revolting and served with what appeared to be Heinz seafood sauce. My boyfriend's duck shepherd's pie was greasy, small and swimming in fat. All in all the bill came to \u00a3160 which we certainly anticipated, but for this price range you would expect high quality French food. We will not be returning, considering brasserie Zedel is not too far away and has a far more spectacular ambience for half the price I cannot believe Balthazar gets away with the terrible expensive food it has to offer. Please save your money and go elsewhere! London has so much more to offer than this overpriced mediocrity!"

But I came back the following week with friends, and then again with my family, until we figured out it was best to come before it opens to be the first wave of customers in. And then it became a regular thing with anyone visiting, ever. Or any catch up, or any birthday celebrations - yes - we're going to Le Relais de Venise L'Entrecote for dinner.\nThe experience starts with a mouth watering walnut salad with this yummy sauce, but the unspeakably good star of the show is the sauce that comes with the steak. Let me rewind a bit and say that steak and fries is all you're gonna get. You tell the waitress how you like it (blue, rare, medium or well done - there is no in-betweens), she writes it on the table and off she goes. When it comes out - you are presented with a plate of delicious steak and fries to mop up all the excess sauce you manage not to cram in on every single bite. \nI was so shocked the first time I came here because, as normal, I finished my meal in record time still lusting for more. AND MORE THERE WAS. The waitress comes back with the SECOND HALF (?!?!) of your meal, the steak that was still in the kitchen so that it won't go cold, and an extra helping of fries. Lord have mercy.\nAnd once you think you can't go on, you have a look around and get massive food envy as all these delicious looking desserts start piling out. Now, I don't speak french so you're just gonna have to figure this one out on the menu yourself but the MUST orders are the profiteroles (which I usually don't like, but these are filled with vanilla ice cream instead of cream and are DELICIOUS!) and this stack of ice cream, meringue, praline, amazingness.\nThis place is definitely a 10/10 in my books!"

    "review": "Le Relais de venise only does one thing, but it does it well: steak frittes. On being seated, the server will ask how you want your steak cooked - if you're vegetarian and/or have a nut allergy, this is your opportunity to shout. The green salad brought to you before your main has walnuts on top, but if you ask for them to be left off, it's not a problem. What may be a bigger problem is that the chips are cooked in groundnut oil - if you have a peanut allergy, you will starve.\nI believe vegetarians can substitute their steak for a lot of cheese, but it's an expensive option. \u00a324 for steak frittes or \u00a324 for fromage frittes with a dessert. If you're a veggie, I just wouldn't bother.\nThe steak is brought to you in two parts, which effectively works out as two giant plates of cow and chips, so it's a big undertaking. My advice is to skip lunch because if you can't finish the main, you will be disappointed with yourself.\nThe desserts are around the \u00a35/\u00a36 mark and are nice (the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is a reliable offering) however you will probably be too full to manage one. House wine (around \u00a35 a glass, \u00a310 for a carafe, \u00a320 for a bottle) is drinkable enough.\nYou can't book a table even if you're a group, so eat early (5.30pm) or expect to queue out the door. Although tables are a little close, that's because there are a lot of people who want to get in and don't mind sitting on their neighbours.\nAll in all, this isn't a cheap meal, but it's a substantial one, cooked well."

    "review": "My first Le Relais experience was in Paris where I accidentally walked into that restaurant. And I enjoyed that experience. When I learned that there was another version in London, I had to make sure I had to bookmark it on my trip here.\nWalking in the London version, it even feels like you're in Paris. The tables are very cramped and that you are literally right next to another stranger only inches away. So you need to pull out the table to move around.\nAnd just like the Paris versions, there are no menus. Just steak and frites with a small salad in the beginning. But it's the sauce that makes this place standout compared to other steak joints. It has a nice, tangy vinaigrette flavor that only this restaurant can provide. The steaks by themselves are just normal steaks, served in only \"Rare\" or \"Medium.\" Even \"medium rare\" is not allowed. Again, just rare or medium here in London.\nAnd just like the Paris version, you get your second serving shortly after you finished your first plate. \nAnd as for the dessert, you may need one of the French waitresses to help you out since the menu is in French. But I went with the Profiteroles au chocolat. Nice warm chocolate smothering some vanilla ice cream with shaved walnuts. Now that is a great way to finish the meal."

I feel like I've gotten comparable steak and fries elsewhere, but the sauce really brought the whole dish together. It really makes you wanna go back for more and more! I will say, however, that I've had better steak elsewhere. I may have a skewed view, though, because I had a really intense conversation with relatives while eating there and was somewhat distracted. Overall, though, this place was amazing! I'd totally come here again if I am in the neighborhood."

We all know they're trying to get customers through quickly (this place must make a FORTUNE!); however, I never felt even a little rushed. Everything was perfectly timed to allow us to enjoy a relaxed meal.\nThe house Bordeaux is super drinkable, not overly tannic, and well-balanced (even if slightly lacking in depth), with a seemingly minimal price markup for a bottle. \nWhat you get is what you come for. Delicious steak and fries. It's an excellent and simple meal perfectly executed. What more does one need to say? \nShow up early if you don't want to wait, otherwise, expect to wait!"

I was excited because it's in my neighbourhood and I've been wanting to check it out because I've heard great things about it.\nFood: There's no menu.  They only serve steak frites and as much as you want of it.  They will ask how you would like your meat cooked.  They then start off with a simple salad, the steak comes in small slices, frites and a wonderful sauce that makes you want more.  Very simple.\nDrinks: We ordered one sprite and tap water.\nPrice: 56.10 GBP for two people.\nAmbiance: The restaurant feels like a true bistro in Paris.  It was very crowded and bustling for lunch.  It's first come, first serve and they will not seat your party until everyone is there.  \nService: This is why I gave three stars.  Here's where everything went wrong.  The service was horrible.  Our server was a woman who seemed like she hated her job.  She didn't have the time of day for us.  She was very unfriendly, curt, rude and kept bumping into my girlfriend's chair without even saying I'm sorry.  There was a table next to us that was empty and when they were about to seat two people she looked at the diners, said \"oh sh*t\" and then slammed down the cutlery and glasses onto the table.  The icing on the cake was when she was serving me the frites and dropped one in to my water glass.  She didn't apologise or even come back to replace my water.  I waited for 10 minutes, asked for a new glass of water only to find her very annoyed.\nWould I go back?  Maybe.  I wouldn't rush back and if I did go back I would definitely not sit in the section of that server if she's still there."

We were the last group to be seated snagging the final open table, and we had a minimal wait of 10 minutes.  If I had to wait 45 minutes, I would have done it gladly.\nIntriguing fact number 1: There was no menu. I was so confused. My date (sister in law) was getting the giggles off the bat watching me trying to piece together this culinary puzzle. A lady came to take our order, simply asking how we liked our meat. Strange, what if I wanted fish....? I said rare, and then she took a marker to my side of the table with a large \"R\" (clearly it is paper table cloths!) \nIntriguing fact number 2: Then they brought out a salad. I didn't ask for a salad, but I certainly didn't send it back!  Butter leaf lettuce with walnuts and a mustard vinegrette. It was so simple and yum! \nThen the waitress came to the table and served me beautifully butterflied steak strips with a green sauces and hot chips.  The chips were long, skinny and crunchy!  And the meat, well, it was one of the best meals I've ever had. The meat is imported from Scotland, and it is in a league of it's own!!!  Intriguing fact number 3: I got my entree, twice! Oh yes, what is better than one delicious meal? Having two helpings of it! SO don't worry when you polish off your plate.... more is coming!!!\nHead out there (early) so that you can roll out of there like I did, content and happy as a clam.

    "review": "You ever meet those people that are really, REALLY good at one thing? Like, you have that roommate you went to school with who knows trivia from \"The Matrix\" movies better than anyone, or there was that girl you crushed on who could mop the floor with anyone on Wednesday nights when the local pub is having trivia for the week and the theme is H.P. Lovecraft and you're both impressed and terrified? This place is like your friend, only they are incredibly good at serving steak and fries. Oh, and being awesomely personable. And being able to tolerate a table of out-of-towners (from Texas, to boot) with the patience and sass of someone who can easily blend patience and sass while also convincing me to have not one but two scotches after a bottle of wine. Yes, this place and the staff are that good.\nWe arrived around 8:00 on a Friday night per the recommendations of the locals. The place is a small restaurant with a line wrapping around the corner and extending back into a corner of an alley where you can look up at the guy living in the apartment across from the place who methodically paces while on the phone and organizes his shoe collection (sorry guy who lives across the place - but your shoe collection is boss). There's a reason people are willing to wait 45+ minutes in the cold and rain for this place. And if you're still reading this review, you're about to find out why.\nWe probably waited around 25 minutes, but we got lucky. A professional and polite hostess greeted us at the door when our turn in line had come and we were walked to a table in a crowded dining room. Let there be no doubt: L'Entrecote has figured out how to maximize their space and the maximum occupancy here is probably 6,000 despite being the size of my hotel's lobby. You'll be making new friends at your table, such as the traveling couple next to us who were absolutely sweet, so if you're shy, you may need to get over that real quick.\nOur waitress came over and took our order and immediately panic sunk in. No \"medium rare\" steak?! Send me back to Texas where our beef is still moo-ing when you cut into it! Turns out there was nothing to fear as the \"medium\" steak was heavenly. My advice would be to placate the salad beforehand and save room for the main course. Don't get me wrong - the salad may rock your socks off but the steak and fries will also send your socks to the cleaners and bring them back with a complimentary breath mint. \nThe whole place operates on a \"steak and fries are our entrees\" menu, and there's a reason: the sauce. If you've tasted their sauce and found it anything less than a miracle on your plate, please book a trip to the local funeral parlor because you clearly were born without a soul. I went back for seconds, another in our party went back for thirds. Add all this up on our bottle of red wine and you have a meal fit for anyone who plans on eating themselves into a coma. This doesn't even take dessert into consideration, with the absolute best profiteroles I have ever had. Bonus tip for those of you still reading: get a round of scotch (or two, in my case) with the profiteroles. Not only will the sweetest bartender in the world deliver them, but you will find out that this is a combo no one can beat without some serious effort.\nSpeaking of the sweet staff, everyone working here is an undercover angel. I'm convinced of it. I never call out staff in my reviews but our server, Asia, was phenomenal. She not only put up with our relentless questions and my request for scotch after wine and port, but she did it with a level of quick wit that immediately endeared her with all of us. The team here helps each other out, with one girl removing empty glasses deftly and naturally, the bartender delivering scotch with a divine smile, and the food runners polished and focused on their destination. Make no mistake, the reason this place operates as efficiently as it does is because of the immaculate workers under the roof.\nSure, you can knock on them for wanting to turn a table quickly to get the line out the door moving, and you can complain about the limited menu. Doing either of those is providing a grave disservice to this establishment, a hearty dining option filled with delicious food, professional staff and a diverse enough dessert menu to ensure you need to come back. And if this is your first time eating here, I genuinely envy you and what you are about to experience."

    "review": "After a little confusion about whether this was an all you can eat place (it isn't), a group of 8 of us headed here for dinner while in London. After looking on Yelp I was really worried about just how long we'd have to queue for but thankfully on a Thursday if you arrive around 6 - 6.30, you won't have to wait at all. Score!\nWe were seated at a large table and they quickly took our orders - I mean, super quickly. The only thing available is the steak and chips (with a salad to start) and they simply ask how you want it done. Options are blue, rare, medium and well done. I went for rare as I figured this being their speciality it was better to go for less cooked than over cooked. \nI didn't particularly enjoy the salad starter, to be it was just a normal kind of salad with dressing. There was also bread on the side which again, didn't win me over as it was just a standard kind of baguette. When the steak arrived though, I was in heaven. Lovely and pink with a delicious gravy kind of sauce and a good portion of chips. I quite like that they served your meat in two goes although I'm sure the second portion that was served to me was my workmates order of blue steak as it was a hell of a lot more bloody than my first portion (that being said, I still ate it). \nService here is weird - they are all aloof and abrupt. I didn't realise we were still in those days of service, I thought that died along with Gordon Ramsay's popularity in the early 2000s. Stuffy, unfriendly service is never going to win me over no matter how good the food is.

We were seated promptly and put in our orders. I was a little hesitant to go to this place as I like my steak a certain way (blue - as in, almost still alive) and it almost always disappoints in the UK (because a steak ordered blue in Britain often comes out as medium rare or even medium - ick! And British people get twitchy if you send food back in restaurants, so it really is rolling the dice). But my friend really wanted steak and this seemed like a good option in the neighborhood.\nAs others have noted, there are no menu choices - only desired level of doneness for steak. I ordered mine blue. We also got the house Bordeaux, which paired nicely with the food. When the steak came out, it actually was blue! Success! But the plate was so ripping hot that it was starting to convert the beautiful bloody meat to a grey overcooked mess, so I had to be uncouth and evacuate it to the bread plate. The server gave me a \"wtf\" look and I tried to explain, but she didn't speak English, so they probably just thought I was a weirdo, but whatever. That's better than ending up with overcooked steak.\nOverall, it was a reasonably good dinner, but for \u00a324, I could make myself better steak frites. Nice atmosphere, though. I'd say it's worth it if you want a simple, pretty good meal, but it's definitely not worth waiting more than a few minutes. If the line is long, probably better to find someplace else."

So when I heard that this steak dinner would be an amazing deal and the sauce would be what seals it, I expected more.\nWhat I got (everyone gets) for 24 pound deal = \n*To start: a fairly run-of-the-mill waldorf salad (walnuts, romaine, mustard-based dressing) and half of a French baguette, which was soft but cold and I would have liked some butter to go on it. I ended up dipping it in dijion mustard, as there was a jar of it on the table and I liked the kick \n*Supposed star of the show: Two servings of steak frites (cooked only at rare, medium or well, already slice and covered in a mustard-based sauce) - This might sound like the typical (possibly ignorant) American tourist, but I'm not used to already have my steak cut for me and not being able to order my desired medium rare. The sauce also tasted a bit bland to me. The frites were fine - shoe-string so extra crispy. Overall, this was plenty of food but afterward, I felt unsatisfied so I ordered dessert (rare for me!)\nUltimate letdown - the lemon tarts. I was shocked to receive what seemed like grocery chain store quality dessert as they had rock hard crust that seemed to lack sugar and a filling that tasted more saccharine rather than zippy from citrus (which I craved).\nWith a glass of the cheapest house red wine and gratuity added on to the bill, my dinner ran closer to 40 pounds total. So I suggest to avoid waiting in line, and instead save your money for street or pub food of similar (sometimes better) quality for a quarter of the cost."

From outside it looks like a classic French cafe, which sits two minutes away from the city's busiest shopping epicenter (bond street/oxford street). \nI didn't have high expectations for this place despite the many glowing reviews my peers had given it; I quickly withdrew my preconceived notions when the meal began.\nWe arrived at 6:15 pm (15 minutes before the restaurant opens) - mind you, this is a Tuesday night, not the weekend - and the line of eagerly waiting customers was already curling around the corner. I knew I was in for a treat. It was rather funny once we were seated because I picked up the menu card (see photo) and there was literally ONE choice listed: The walnut salad and entrecote with a \"famous sauce.\" I'm a sucker for guarded restaurant secrets and I knew that must have been the reason why everyone frequents it. The meal is split into \"first\" and \"second\" service (first and second helpings) and only costs 23 pounds (~$35).. That's like restaurant week prices back in America. \nThe salad was quite simple and leafy. As I savored the tangy dijon flavor of the dressing, I took a minute to survey my surroundings. The waitresses were hustling around taking orders and serving customers. The restaurant had filled up in the first 5 minutes and there were already another 100 people waiting outside. \nOur first serving had arrived and it was a perfectly medium-rare piece of tender beef. Entrecote typically comes from the rib side of the cow, but could also be a sirloin, depending on how it's cut. I digress. The meat could have been a little warmer, but then again they were entertaining a full dinner service and the food came in a timely manner. \nThe beef was smothered in the most delicious french sauces I've ever tasted. It wasn't a bearnaise as far as I could tell. And I definitely don't think there was any pepper in it. The consistency was somewhat soupy and the greenish tinge must have been taken from an herb. After several tastings, I feel like it might be basil (perhaps an allusion to Venice/Italy?). The rich, flavorful aftertaste of butter lingered on your palate after every bite -  probably a thickening agent used at the very end. The seasoning was perfect. I also tasted some garlic and maybe white wine? If it's a french sauce, they probably began with minced shallots too, which they later strained out (providing a little sweetness). But what do I know? (see photo). I ventured to ask them, and of course I got \"it's a secret.\"\nThey gratuitously pile on a load of french fries which sort of adds an extra 500 calories to your meal, but it somehow goes well with the rest of the meat. After all, 'meat and potatoes' is always a fail-safe. When you think you're done, you're surprised to be offered another portion of everything! Each serving of beef is a little smaller than a filet, but overall, it's quite filling. It was indeed very delicious.\nWe finished the meal off with the Vacherin de Relais dessert; a tower of meringue and ice cream blanketed with chocolate syrup and a dollop of chantilly cream on top. So amazing (see photo). \nI would definitely come here again for this eating experience. You won't be spoiled for choice, but the one thing they offer is a home run. A toast to French cuisine. \n5/5"

    "review": "Apparently, there is always a really long line here, so I would recommend going on a weekday when it isn't as bad.  When we got there, the line had just wrapped around the corner and we probably waited about 25 minutes to get seated, which went by quickly. \nThe menu is fixed and consists of a salad, steak, and fries.  As soon as you sit, a server greets you and immediately asks how you want your steak cooked: rare, medium, or well done.  The bread and butter they set on the table for you is quite tasty but try not to eat too much of it, because you will have a generous portion of food coming your way.  The salad comes with a mustard vinaigrette which was delicious.  As soon as you are finished, they bring you your first portion of steak with fries.  When you finish that, they will bring your second portion of steak with MORE fries.  The steak is served with their \"famous\" sauce, which was outstanding.  They do have dessert, which looked great, but I was way too full to eat anything else.\nFun:\n They serve your main course in two portions so that it remains hot.  Also, they do have a vegetarian option available!  I believe the vegetarian meal is the salad with some sort of selection of cheeses along with the fries, and your choice of dessert.  Both the vegetarian and meat-lovers meals are only 23 pounds! Not bad for great, quality food."

Woke up this morning feeling a little queasy from the amount of oil on the fries as well...\nIt's a shame they don't do the salad with some of the steak slices on top for \u00a310.

I personally much rather grab a good old Babette and chips for 15-20\u00a3 rather than being in this mess..\nAlso the steak has no crust, could argue this is how French take steaks, the green sauce has hardly any flavour, the meat is under salted... The salad tends to be over dressed - the only charm seems to be fries.. Which for me is a very bad value... \nBy the way, this is one menu restaurant, salad followed by steak in green butter sauce with fries.. \nI would easily live a happy life without ever having to go.., by the way, I did not have any particularly bad experience... It is just super crowded, and chaotic for nothing for my taste."

My husband and I were in London for a weekend trip, and he had eaten at their location in The City while in London for work, but they were closed that night. SO, we went to this location instead. We arrived at about 7:30 pm on a sunday evening, and there was a line (note: they do NOT take reservations). However, we didn't stand in line for longer than 20 minutes. And, if it's cold (like it was the evening we went, there are heaters outside the building to keep you warm while you wait. \nWe sat down, with my husband on the booth side of the table, and myself in a normal chair. The waitress came up and to both of our surprise, pushed the table as far back towards the wall as it would go. At first I thought, well, that was bizzarre. But after I thought about it some more, there are quite a few tables crammed into such a small building. \nOrdering dinner consisted of the following: Hello and welcome. How do you like your steak cooked? Rare. And would you like something to drink? Red wine. Okay, that'll be right out. Easiest ordering process EVER! About 2 minutes later, our salad was brought out with our wine. The other nice thing about this restaurant only serving one type of food, is that your food comes out SO fast. Which pleased my belly, I was quite hungry.\nWhen the steak came out, and I saw a green sauce on top of it. I was a bit wary, as I've had some HORRIBLE sauces (most specifically roquefort sauces). But the sauce on the steak is great. The only thing I didn't like about eating here? There was too much food and I couldn't eat it all. Le sigh. \nI will definitely be going back to this restaurant the next time I'm in London. And just as a tip (at least while I was there), if you check in on yelp, you get half off on weekends at their canary wharf location."

Service was quick and efficient but not exactly warm and fuzzy. It did fill up in the next hour with people mostly there for business lunch and a few solo female shoppers with masses of shopping bags. \nThe meal itself wasn't bad. Steak medium was exactly medium, served with more fries than steak. The sauce looked mustardy and oily and tasted bland. I actually added mustard from the jar on the table to give it a kick. Walnut salad was iceberg lettuce drenched in a bland mustard dressing but had no walnuts. Baguette was near perfect though. A glass of wine came filled exactly to the pre-drawn line. \nOverall, this place was ok but I wouldn't wait any amount of time. Branches in other cities, including the original Paris location are fairly busy but there is usually no wait."

Probably a good thing there's no choice too as they want you in and out of there as quick as is humanly possible - ain't no time for dawdling! \nSo on first impression, I was wondering what all the fuss was about. We were rushed into our seats and order taken within 3 minutes (or so it felt!) There were no smiles or charm but functional swiftness.\nThen came the plate. It was tiny. My friend next to me actually said the words \"I think I'm going to cry if this is all we're getting.\" Fortunately, cry he did not, as actually, they give you a small plate initially, then give you a full top up once you're running low, so that the meat is kept cooked perfectly for you and the food stays hot. I've never seen this approach before and it's pretty cool I must say.\nThe steak comes sliced thinly, with shoestring fries and their special secret sauce on top. The sauce was unbelievably good. Between us, we couldn't figure it out. Somewhere between a gravy and a mushroom sauce with maybe a little bit of pesto thrown in?? \nMy only regret was that I ordered the steak as medium (they don't do medium rare which would be my usual order) They offer 'blue', 'rare', 'medium' and 'well done', so in future I would definitely go for rare.\nThe food really was excellent. It's just a pity you never really feel relaxed in there, and as I said, a smile wouldn't hurt. \nEither way, I'd definitely recommend!"

Then after choosing how you want your steak cooked, usual options, not long after it arrives cooked in the most divine - and secretive! - sauce ever along with a heavily heaped portion of frites. I highly recommend the house red to go along with this too, we loved it and it goes really well with the meal. When you are reaching the end of your meal, they come along with some more slices of your steak and even more frites if you require these! \nThree out of the five in our party chose desserts and we were all impressed, I had a lovely praline gelato which I recommend.  \nI would definitely recommend a visit here especially for a special occasion or a formal meal. The service was quick, efficient and friendly too making it even more of a winner. \nLocated on the very trendy / sauve Marylebone Lane, just off the High Street it is convenient for walking and / or public transport due to its close proximity to Oxford Street and Baker Street."

No. Plain. Simple.\nAs Everybody else said (and I mean every other 136 reviews), one choice salad, steak, fries. Stop. Strange, I was prepared for it, ok, Cool.\nThere is ALWAYS a queue in front of the place, on the weekend it could last for more than an hour, maybe even two. Luckily the place is REALLY crowded, otherwise there would probably a queue from there to Westminster. Ah when I mean crowded I mean SERIOUSLY crowded. I'm slim and I spent my whole time squeezed up in my seat, basically if you are more than 90 kg you'll have serious issues in finding a place here.. Maybe you are filling the place too much, you damn french business with an italian name!?!\nAh BTW, this is a french place with an italian name where most of the waitresses are polish, we had peruvian beer and english steak. Funny, for a place pretending to be french. Whatever.\nNow, the meal: first is the salad, well, wow, IT'S A DAMN SALAD WITH WALNUT AND WALNUT OIL, get over with! I mean why should I even care in having such a thing? It's just a basic salad, no preparation, nothing: the pieces are even a bit too big for a salad, and there is nothing interested in it.\nThen it comes the steak. Drum rolls, trumpets and bla bla. Well, nothing special. I mean seriously NOTHING SPECIAL.\nThe steak is good, but not that good (Wanna experience a serious steak? go to hawksmoore, THERE YOU'LL HAVE A DAMN STEAK). It comes as a \"tagliata\" (don't know the english name, sorry), basically it's already cut in slices, which is a very dangerous thing to do, as the meat will be cut somewhere and then put on the plate (actually it makes two movements after, from the cutting board to the tray and from the tray to the dish). Result: dry steak of course, as every bit of juice has been left over the two past surfaces. I mean there are serious errors, and they are making the strong points over that, how is it even possible!?!\nYeah theoretically the dryness of our tortured piece of meat will be covered by the sauce. Now, the sauce is said to be \"the best part\". No it's not. It's a bit blend, basically it's just a fatty buttery sauce with mustard and pesto, that's it. No inspiration, no soul, no feeling. Just the usual blend sauce you'll find next to the roast in any self service in every hotel in the world. Ouch.\nI don't even want to speak about the fries, they are just fries, whatever. My dog can prepare it. And I don't even have a dog.\nSo why the two stars!?!?\nRESURRECTION\nINSPIRATION\nHERE COMES THE DESSERT.\nYes baby, bring it on that juicy profiterole! Aaaah the profiterole , you bloody bastard! awesomely sweet on the inside, deliciously bitter on the outside, a real chocolate sauce covering splendid bigne' filled with creamy gelato. Awesome, just DAMN AWESOME.\nIf this place will even allow me to have just the profiterole avoiding that piece of boredom before, it'd deserve 5 stars. No, it'd deserve 6 stars, 7 stars, at least a galaxy.\nLONG LIFE TO THE PROFITEROLE. HALLELUJAH."

There is not a menu, you simply state how you want your meat cooked and that is all. I specified that I wanted a vegetarian order. And I'm not going to lie I was a BIT worried. I had no idea what was going to be on my plate.\nI was brought a simple salad with mixed greens, walnuts and a \"secret\" mustard dressing, which was delicious. Then they brought over the most massive, beautiful platter of assorted cheeses I have ever seen. I was able to select a bit of each cheese, which came out to be about 6 different cheeses, and quite large portions at that. From the brie to the roquefort, each one was DIVINE. Needless to say, I was the happiest camper. With my cheese, greens, and delicious glass of red, I was in heaven.\nAnd for those of you that do in fact eat meat, this is obviously the place for you. You do not only get one portion of steak, but they will bring you a second serving if you like. Their secret recipe for the green sauce that is put in the steak is incredible, I tried a spoonful. The chips are delicious too and are great for dipping in any of extra special sauce you have left on your plate.\nService is quite good here and they move rather quickly. Be prepared to shout, as the restaurant is quite loud. But it has a wonderful vibe and buzz to it. The puddings menu is quite extensive with tons of options. From rich cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e to lighter sorbet options, there is something for everyone. \nSo all you vegetarians out there should never fear the lovely L'Entrec\u00f4te.

The numbers suggest there are as many cows per acre here as Texas -- that does sound wrong doesn't it?\nOk all that said, Texas steaks probably are better, but this is a grain-fed vs. grass-fed discussion, and reviewing a French restaurant is probably not the best place to do so. \nA meal at Le Relais is 50% food, 50% some schmuck tourist friend made me stand in a line for a restaurant that only does one dish.  I really enjoyed my last meal there, especially the salad and the fries.  Having recently eaten at 5 Guys, I don't think that is a fair comparison; McDs vs Relaix would've been more apt, as 5 Guys serve those skin-on peanut oil reeking variety which, lets be honest, are subpar to anyone that knows anything about french fries.\nI don't recall the room being so tight and the service being so snotty, but perhaps tight is relative to a Texan, you fat pigs -- JOKING, it is a bit tight in there, but as far as service goes, it depends on the server and how busy it is.  \nThe steak is quite good, though could be overly lean if one is splitting hairs, and I do enjoy the sauce.

And sometimes you want a well-prepared comforting meal on a plate.\nRelais does a good rendition of the latter, serving a well-crafted and comforting meal that always leaves me feeling like my soul has gotten a tiny bit of nourishment on top of the healthy meal I've just enjoyed.\nIt's decent value and for your money you'll have a good meal. You won't spend a lot of time pouring over the menu because it's basically steak. And frites. They're brought to you in two batches (so you don't end your meal with cold frites) with a highly addictive and mysterious secret sauce. The service could be warmer - they certainly don't aim to connect with you -  but the food itself always seems to tick the boxes, done exactly as it should be done, served in just the right amounts at the right time.\nFor those of you visiting from the States, I'll leave two comments based on previous reviews and I'll preface those comments by saying I also am from (Gasp! Horror!) Texas.\n1. This may seem like an expensive meal because of the exchange rate but actually by London standards it's not and is actually great value.\n2. You can't compare Relais to places in the states (or in London) that are or sell themselves as high-end. That's not what this place is about. It's a steak frites place, not the latest and greatest high-priced steakhouse. Will Relais serve you the best steak you've ever had? Nope.

I was getting full but the crunch of the fresh frites made me wanna finish my meal up.\n5* on the le profiteroles du chocolate- at my server's recommendation when I asked for something chocolaty thats not too sweet. Its thin choux pastry with vanilla ice cream, drenched in melted dark chocolate sauce and almond slices. (Note: my mouth is drooling as I am writing the description. I want it again!) The sensation of hot and cold in your mouth makes it extra yummy.\n6* for cute french maids in french maid outfits with matching cute personalities\n6* for service level and the way the servers handled drama. There was an overly boisterous drunk dude that stood up and started clapping at his table. Moments later he fell off his seat, hitting the customer behind me. 3 of the servers came and talked to him. One talked to him, the other two reassured the surrounding diners. 15 mins later, he started banging on the table really loudly several times and was extremely loud in his proclamations. My server went over to placate him. He instantly had his hand around her waist and as they talked, his hand went to her butt! She calmly finished talking to him and deftly maneuvered his hand away.

You let the server know how you want the steak to be done and in a few minutes, you see them bring over trays to the counter and our server started preparing our dish.  \nI thought it was interesting that after we were finished with our first dish, she came back again with the rest of our steak and frites to replenish.  It makes us feel like we were in a buffet but then realize that it was just the rest of our steak.

That's the most we've ever paid for lunch and frankly, I think I would've been ok with a croissant sandwich in one of those takeaway restaurants. \nSo yeah, doubt we'll ever come to eat at this place especially when the pounds are so dang expensive compared to euro dollars now.  Oh well, live and learn. =D"

We happened to be there on a bank holiday and they opened up at 6:30 instead of 6.  We made sure to ask for more sauce and bread to soak it up with, we are not shy- the sauce is so unique.  We ordered the profiteroles and several orders of vacheron.  The vacheron is hands down the best dessert ever!  The tower of ice cream, meringue and hazelnut chocolate sauce is not to be missed."

We got there and saw a line out front waiting to get in. Unfortunately, everyone had to wait on it, both large and small groups. This was a bit disappointing since sometimes a party of two can get seated quickly in a crowded venue. Anyway we waited and it wasn't the end of the world.\nOnce we got seated, everything was great. There isn't much of a selection here as I think the only things you can get as a main are steak and fries. There could be other options, but we were both quite happy to have the steak and fries.\nBasically, the server just asks you how you like your steak and then brings you sliced steak and fries. It was quite good.\nAfter the main course we had deserts which were also quite good.\nThroughout the whole meal, service was great.\nI would definitely come back here, just not at a peak time. It might be a good place for a late lunch as there was practically no line to get in when we were leaving."

Bread and salad for the table were solid, but we all know we were really there for.  By the time we finished it, we were like sharks during feeding time- stalking the waitress at the corner of our hungry little eyes and hoping she would come around soon to feed our hungry little mouths.\nAnd 5 minutes she returned to the shark pen with plates full of crispy thin fries and six slices of meat doused in green sauce.  I mistakenly asked for medium and I think the medium was actually more medium-well, and the rare was actually medium.  Order rare when asked, please make your experience that much more worth it.\nBy the way I don't know what they put in that sauce, but it is in-sauce-xicating.  Pun fail, I think so.  I could drink that sauce.\nThe nicest part of this was that they come around with a second helping.  Surprise- more meat!  Can't complain about that, even if the meat was nothing mind blowing.  That sauce though, I'm coming back for you."

The only choice this restaurant will have you make is regarding the temperature of your steak. \nAs for wine, make it the house red; great drinkability at a decent price point.\nSoon after you place your order a pile of salad will arrive at your table dressed in a light mustardy vinaigrette with half a handful of walnuts strewn over the top. This salad tastes better than its homely appearance would have you believe.\nNext comes the steak, doused in a green sauce (don't ask what's in it, the recipe is highly guarded) and accompanied by a pile of fries. But this is only the beginning - one more portion of meat and frites is still to come! Who doesn't love seconds, right?\nIt's no surprise they do not have ketchup but no aioli either? Mustard was no stand in dipper for my frites and I was left wishing for a bit of mayonnaisey goodness. However, I soon realized that the secret green sauce did the trick. \nLe Relais De Venise L'Entrecote is a lovely little respite from poring over menus night after night in search of what's good.

That's all I heard from my local friend about this place.  \"We gotta go to steak frites!\"  I asked my friend, \"is the place really called steak frites?\"  \"No it's not, not sure exactly the name but we need to get there early to get in line- 5:30PM.  WTF!  \nAnyway, after watching the Chelsea/Portsmouth match at a local pub, which shall go nameless, we walked towards Steak Frites!  The build up to Steak Frites! was unbearable.  My friend Sean, kept talking about the one item menu, the salad, the sauce that comes with the steak, the top notch fries, how you can have seconds...etc....  I was salivating- unfortunately we arrived at 5PM and they were not open yet, but we were second line!.  \nThe brilliant part about this location is that if you get there early, you can go across the alley to the Italian restaurant (which is open), sidle up to the bar and order spiritous libations while you wait for Steak Frites! to open.  Double Jack and Coke, extra ice, keep 'em coming and thanks to Stacy for waiting in line while we went for drinks.  By the way, if you sweet talk the bartendress, she'll put your bev in a paper cup so you can go back across the street and relieve your compatriots.\nOK- finally, we were seated and this place was true to the hype.  Cute waitressess in French maids outfits, no menu, just how do you want the steak and how's your wine list- well done!  The salad with mustard dressing was devine.  The Steak Frites! were fantastic!  The sauce- nonpareil!  You will not find a better sauce.  The best part is they keep a second helping on the flame so you can have more-  then you build the perfect bite- a bit of steak, mashed into some Frites! and then dipped in their secret sauce and it is game on!  Fucking Delicious!\nHow can a restaurant serve just one thing and stay in business.  Well.... just go here and find out.  You will be rewarded!\nOh, by the way, they have dessert too.

I normally REALLY hate queueing for food in London, as you're never normally more than a five minute walk away from another good eaterie. A twenty minute queue on a Wednesday night in November was a bit excessive in my opinion (but in spite of looking up alternatives on my friend's iPad we stayed the course).\n It was sort of worth the wait, as after a while you just think, we've waited this long we may as well stay. Would I do it again? Probably not.\n Steak was well cooked, the sauce tasty, the mustardy dressing on the salad was very mustardy and with two helpings, I was full.\n Profiteroles were yummy (although extremely cold fillings - not sure if it was icecream) and the tarte citron very good.\n I'm glad I went but for another twenty minute queue it would have to be super special."

The food is good, but not amazing. \nI won't repeat what the other reviews attest to other than to confirm that: \n1) We waited about 45 minutes in a queue snaking around the corner.\n2) There is no main menu. Drinks and desert are extra.\n3) Vegetarian (cheese platter) includes desert \"free\".\n4) The green sauce is delish.\nEverything is rushed. The interior is loud. Waitresses in French-maid getups quickly serve you food in an efficient manner. Fries are \"pre-cooked\" (i.e., not made to order) and sit in a large tray waiting to be dished out to you. The house wine was pretty good.\nFor the steak itself, it is served in slices with green sauce. Americans who like their steak grilled will be disappointed. The steak reminds one of brisket. The steak is good, but again, not awe-inspiring. Don't expect Kobe beef.\nThe desert was disappointing. I ordered the creme puffs and my friend ordered something resembling stacked macaroons. The pastries themselves were OK, but they were slathered in chocolate. It's like someone got a bottle of Hershey's chocolate syrup and went loco. Not what I expect from a French restaurant.\nAll in all Le Relais provides a unique experience in that it efficiently serves a single menu item at a good price.

The meat under the sauce could just as easily have been mushrooms chicken or tofu. \nThere were seconds, which brought the total steak serving up to around 9 ounces.\nSo  \u00a320 seems to me a lot to pay for a salad and frites, however good.

Well, you won't get me again - I say tap water everywhere I go now.\n4) Nothing was that amazing.  The salad had this garlic dressing (in all honesty, it's been a while, the flavor might not have been garlic, but it was really strong whatever it was) that completely overpowered the rest of the salad, the steak had only what seemed to be a watered-down curry flavor, and the frites were tiny.  I also didn't love when they gave me more food.  Now don't get me wrong, I do love getting free food, but the way they present it has all the trappings of shoveling gruel on your plate.  The desserts looked amazing, and I ordered this macaroon tower, but they also failed to impress.\n5)  Finally, I realize they can do nothing about this, but does every freakin' person in the UK smoke?  Waiting in the 1 hour queue, we were continually blasted by smoke.  \nOn the other hand, the two people waiting behind us were a lot of fun - a great way to meet new people.  \nAnyways, if I ever want to eat here again, (and I don't), I'll just go to one of the US locations...no reason to go to a US chain when I'm overseas, and I won't be making that mistake again."

They don't take reservations so you start by queuing outside the restaurant, but with the heat lamps and company it can be quite an enjoyable wait. \nOnce you're seated you are presented with a fairly bland looking salad of greens, walnuts and mustard dressing accompanied by freshly baked French bread. But as I learned last night, looks can be deceiving. The mustard dressing is complex in flavour and makes the salad truly spectacular. \nYou are then given one choice, how would you like your steak cooked... rare, medium or well done. It's positively criminal to order anything other than rare. But don't worry, although rare arrives very red in colour, it does not bleed all over the plate. The steak is covered in a mystery green sauce. I have no idea what's in it, but wow it's delicious. And of course the steak is accompanied by piles of frites. Just when you think you're starting to feel full, a second helping of steak and frites are served. I ate the steak (how can you not?), but had to leave the frites so I would have room for dessert.  \nTo accompany our meal we had the house red, again it was fantastic, perfectly complementing the meal. Desserts are also delicious. I would recommend the profiteroles that are served with ice-cream instead of cream. \nAll this and just \u00a320 a head + wine and dessert. Not a bad deal at all!"

    "review": "After months of wanting to come here, but knowing about the queues, we were finally out and about in London and ready to eat right about the time they opened, so I figured it would be the perfect time to go (as no queue, right?) Luckily I was right and we got right in.\nThe menu, easy, steak and fries. And a salad to start. We get our salads and order our wine. The wine comes, the waitress opens it, pours a partial glass (for tasting I assume) and then sets the wine down on the table and walks off? What? Um, shouldn't you wait to make sure the wine is okay before you just leave in on the table and disappear. I mean, if it's not, I suppose we don't have to pour it and drink it, but given the servers come around practically never, that's really not an option. So I take a sip, and joking look over my shoulder, \"Oh yes, that's great thanks!\" Then the wine turns out to be NOT the wine we ordered. Luckily it was a cheaper wine, so we didn't feel so bad about drinking it, and it was quite tasty, but still, why can't the waitress remember what wine to bring? At this point I comment that perhaps they're going for the authentic French experience: rude waitstaff. Except that every place I've been to in France, they've been more than courteous and not at all rude, so clearly if that's what they're going for, they'd going for the stereotype.\nThe steaks arrived. They are arranged fairly unattractively on a small plate with a pile of chips on the side. It was decidingly unattractive and unappealing. You'd think a restaurant that does ONE dish would be able to do it in a way that actually makes it appealing to eat. It also seemed a bit small, but for some unknown reason (because it keeps the food hot maybe? I don't really know) they bring a second portion of the food around when you're done.\nThe food though, yeah it was good. The steak was cooked rare and the sauce was tasty. The chips were also great (and I used some of the mustard on them, tasty). Weirdly though, the steak itself was kind of chewy and not really that great. Again, you'd think a restaurant that ONLY MAKES THIS DISH would make it perfectly. I can cook a better steak at home. Who are the chefs that work here?\nWe get dessert: The other half orders cheese and I order the raspberry tart. I then get up to use the bathroom, and when I return, there are two strawberry tarts on the table. Um, I ordered raspberry. So I can see why they only do one dish now, because that way the servers don't have to remember what people order because clearly they can't. About five minutes later, the cheese finally comes. They serve my other half up some cheese (and it's a lot of cheese, be prepared if you order the cheese for dessert). I mention that they brought the wrong tarts. The server gave me the ugliest stare for even mentioning that it was wrong, but they said they'd bring me the correct tarts. Then they say they'll bring bread for the cheese. Afterwards, I turn to my other half and say, \"Hmm, I wonder which they'll bring first, the tarts or the bread\". Turns out I won, as the tarts turned up. I slowly start eating my tarts (which were quite tasty), and no bread shows up. Finally, I turn around and grab some random person walking by and say, \"Can we get some bread for the cheese?\"\nShe gets bread, then notices that they didn't bring a knife for the cheese (at least this one noticed), so she ran off to get the bread. The cheese turned out quite nice, but we paid the bill and left, and noticed the queue outside the door as we walked away.\nBottom line: The steaks were alright, nothing special. The desserts were good. It's worth the price, but not the wait, so go if you're planning on going early, but not if you're planning on waiting in the queue. The service is definitely not worth it (and given they only do ONE dish, you'd think they'd be WAY more organized than they actually are). And honestly, I had a better steak at La Petite Maison (and hey they actually take reservations, so you don't have to queue). I'm beginning to think that Londoners actually just really like queuing, regardless of the quality of product they'll be receiving (Monmouth coffee anyone?). Herd mentality, maybe? I don't know, but I'll be dining elsewhere for steak thank you."

Why? Let's see. After waiting outside (not terrible I must admit) you're rushed into a jam-packed restaurant, only to be sat at a table so close to the one next to it that it must be pulled all the way out before it's shoved back trapping you in the booth. Then you're met by a \"waitress\" who appears to be dressed for Halloween who asks only \"how do you want it cooked.\" At this point you had better have figured out you're there for steak, or you're screwed. They then scribble your preference on a paper table cloth and are gone. Someone else comes by less than 30 seconds later, throws a forgettable salad down and disappears. Five minutes later a different waitress returns, tosses down a plate of steak smothered in watery green sauce and overcooked, soggy fries and is gone. Sure you get two servings, but I'd trade quality over quantity any day. \nIn short:\nService? Non-existent, and my standards are low. \nSteak? I've had better off a George Foreman grill. \nGreen sauce? Seemed a bit watery and rather flavorless given all the hype. This can't be the best London can do. \nOverall?

Next time I will get the rare. Other than that, the frites and wine were pure bliss.\nAND, for desert i had profiterol, and they were one of the most amazing desserts ever!! yum yum yum.\nIt was quiet pricey but well worth it when you have great company."

But wait, the surprise is in the second round of the same, so hold off on mediocre bread, and indulge in heaping round two. As you well know by the rest of these reviews, you are choice - less on menu options here, other than the temperature of the meat, and my advice  - just say bloody rare...\nI admit that I wasn't entirley oozing with love of the service or the 'all -business, no mingleness' of the server but it/she, like the food was reliable and uncomplicated.  It is yes, as it sounds - the perfect affair, ticks all of your needs, remains consistent and is never complicated.   I would say just who doesn't love a bloody steak and mound of perfect chips, but I imagine Jains, Jivamukti Yoga practitioners and Heather Mills might become irrational at this suggestion. If in fact you are of the few which like your steak trimmed and well-prepared, and your sauces basic, it is a simple must try at least once.\n8:30 on a Weds = queue which moves fairly rapidly, but be forewarned, if you want to eat with the rest of the neighbourhood consultants wear gloves."

You can have your steak prepared one of four ways: blue, rare, medium, well done.

    "review": "Let my forewarn you, dear reader, that my entire experience at this restaurant, as at so many restaurants, was spent in a very pleasant mental fog induced by copious amounts of alcohol imbibed over the course of a warmish English summer's day.  Thus this review is more of a hazy recollection of the overall sensory experience of eating at Entrecote rather than a blow by blow account of what was quite a good meal.\nI arrived at Entrecote in my customary style:  stumbling out of a cab and most likely leaving the bill for some poor sod in my company to pay.  It's easy to sum up my first impressions:  \"gee, that's a long line\".  Entrecote doesn't take bookings and so unless you time your visit cleverly you will have to hang around outside for 20 or 30 minutes.  The most observant readers out there may have noticed that I was the slightest bit sozzled and might have inferred -- correctly -- that I was not the sharpest tool in the drawer at this point of the night.\nThere followed a rather unpleasant minute or two in which I wondered how it would feel to be 20 minutes soberer in 20 minutes time, when my next alcoholic beverage could presumably be procured.  I was fortunately saved from the deep depression this sobering thought (excuse the pun) engendered by a rather wonderful group of lesbians in front of me who most ingeniously went to the pub across the street and came back with a tray of drinks!  This made the wait in the queue pass in a most agreeable fashion.\nSecond impression:  good atmosphere.  Third impression:  where's the menu?  Entrecote serve...well, entrecote and frites.  And salad.  And wine.  And bread.  I think that's about it.  Your only choice is how you want your meat done.  Being \"un snob bourr\u00e9\" I of course ordered mine blue.\nFourth impression:  my plate is empty.  Fifth impression:  my plate magically refills itself!  This is the only restaurant I've ever been in where you get the exact same meal served to you twice.  Most innovative.\nThe food was pretty good, and from recollection was 20 pounds or so which for London seems OK value.  Of course our bill was far more than that due to the wine I kept ordering.  Following Hemmingway's maxim \"Any man who eats dessert is not drinking enough\", I didn't have dessert so I can't vouch for that.  I did have another bottle of wine though."

We got right in on a weekday night.  Knew up front no menu. You get a green salad with a walnut dressing, steak, fries that's it.  They have wine and beer too.  The steak comes with this magical green sauce that they won't tell you because it's a secret recipe.  We devoured our steak and fries and then all of a sudden you get more steak and fries!  This place was so addicting and am so happy we have one here in NYC because I need to go back!"

I can understand why this place is a chain, there should be one in every city.  As for the details - expect to wait in line. But it is worth the wait. \nI went on a Friday night and as long as the line was, it kept moving. The food, i.e. the one thing you can eat there, is really something. Steak and fries with the \"mystery\" sauce, that's it. I say mystery because apparently it's a pretty well guarded secret.  I've found from talking with coworkers that everyone has their opinions as to what's in it.  It's a fun game to play while you eat. After you clean your plate and reflect on the great meal you just had, the waitress appears like an angel with the second helping. \nThe house wine was decent and the price for the meal was well below the high quality of the food. We also tried a few of the deserts, which is crazy considering how full we were after the main course. It was worth the loosening of the belt.\nSeriously recommended!"

The atmosphere can be great or dreadful depending on who you ask, being a loud, almost always crowded place can put off some but also, in the right mood, be quite fun!

    "review": "Relais de Venise is a Parisian born phenomenon. Its original Paris bistro opened in 1959 by Paul Gineste de Saurs, who merely sought a place to serve his family's Ch\u00e2teau de Saurs wines. Opting for an especially short and traditional bistro menu of a simple salad (lettuce, walnuts and potent mustard vinaigrette), steak-frites with a butter-based secret recipe sauce of herbs, spices and condiments along with a few particularly moreish desserts (save room for the profiteroles!), the no nonsense bistro soon won fans for its quality over variety dining experience. It also won a reputation for its strict no reservations policy. Legend tells of married couples meeting on queue and of people securing their next job while waiting for their Frenchy meat and potatoes chow down.\n Based on my experience dining at the Marylebone Lane Relais (but without yet having the pleasure of visiting the flagship in Paris or their other London location in the City), I reckon the food's worth a bit of a wait. The flavoursome frites - made of Bintje potatoes from France that are hand chipped daily on the premises using a bespoke chipper to ensure a signature 7mm thin slice  are out of this world, and the much speculated upon but never revealed secret sauce is a most delectable accompaniment. Here in London, the bistros serve Donald Russell steaks from Aberdeenshire beef (supplier to HM The Queen) for their entrecote steak (which they'll even serve blue).\n An order of salad and main course is priced at \u00a320 per person and yields a more than ample amount of food. Puds cost around \u00a35. A glass of house red is \u00a34.25. Vegetarians are welcome, and as a substitute for the steak a selection of cheeses is offered and a dessert is included for the same price of \u00a320. Service is perfunctory and fast."

This involves an easy choice of venue for dinner, reliably good food, maybe an affordable bottle of wine, and a food-induced coma putting me to sleep. For these nights, Relais delivers.\nThe two locations are convenient for me (The City, and Marylebone), and the food never disappoints. From the walnut salad to the expertly trimmed steak and decadent secret sauce, and just as importantly the very affordable, highly tasty house wine, it is a sure thing that always puts a smile on my face.\nNo reservations means the usual dilemma: (1) arrive before opening to beat the line, or (2) get in the queue and wait your turn. The line moves fast, and is expectedly shorter in the winter, so that helps, but in general, it moves very quickly. To facilitate this, though, you do give up some service during the meal, but as long as you have the right mindset going into it, that is manageable.\nAs for the price, at twenty pounds a head, its a little steep. But there's just nothing else like it, and when you see the demand, you can't really blame them.\nFour stars for delivering on ease, food, wine, and coma. I'll be here often!"

At first I kept grumbling about spending \u00a320 on a set meal I wasn't even hungry for, but I killed this meal like it was my first in days.  You get the only choice of walnut/endive salad and choose how your meat is to be cooked.  When I received my first plate, I was a bit turned off by how small it was. But waiiiiiit, 2/3 way through I get a second plate. More meat! With some successful flirting by my friends, we get a massive dosage of fries.

I'm such a disorganised bloke that I never really think about booking until waaay to late for nice restaurants, so a 10 minute wait outside is a small price to pay for leaving a nice dinner out with my mum to the last minute...\n2.  There is no choice of mains - Awesome... My mum is sooo indecisive in restaurants that choosing from a medium sized menu can take most of the evening.  The fact that the choice is restricted to \"How do you like your steak?\"  severley cut down waiting times!\n3.  The place is packed - Awesome... There is a queue of people waiting to get in (I'd estimate between 10 mins to 45 mins whilst I was there), the tables are close together and the constant burble of conversation creates an ongoing ambience of people getting down to the no nonsense, serious business of stuffing themselves silly.  A proper unpretentious eating establishment.\n4.  The service - Awesome... Despite the busyness of the place, the servers are attentive and quick without being obtrusive.  At no point did I feel rushed, yet every time I needed something a waitress seemed to have read my mind and was standing there with what I wanted.\n5.  The wine - Awesome...  It was both super tasty (from the restaurants own vineyard) and very reasonable.\n6.  The food - You've guessed it... Awesome - The dressed walnut salad to start was delicious and the perfect size to whet my appetite without making me feel as though I was going to have to start eating the table.  The perfectly cooked steak with a divine herb butter sauce and heavenly fries were each simple, but together like all great meals far more than the sum of their parts.  NOTE: remember this is French, so if you usually like your steak medium-rare, go medium, if you usually go well done (philistine), then ask for it burned....\n7.  The price - Awesome... I see someone has had a bit of a whinge in one of the earlier reviews, but I reckon \u00a320 for a two course dinner, paired with \u00a317 fine wine (Making it around \u00a360 for food and wine for 2) is damn fine value!\nI will definitely go again, the only question is whether I have to wait until I have an excuse to take someone or whether I will just pop in on my own the next time I walk past...

Ok, the service is very French but overall, its a great place to go with friends, family, lovers etc. \nThe house red is excellent value and the best tasting wine on the list. Fave pud is the gateaux du relais (chocolate cake 2 ways) \nLastly, dont forget that if you want more sauce, fries or bread, they will gladly bring it to you as its all included.... if you can manage it!"

    "review": "I had high expectations of this restaurant since it was highly recommended by friends who've been to the original Parisian branch (which was unfortunately under renovation when I visited one Summer).\n Alas, I was rather put off by the service (snooty, impersonal French.. it's like being in Paris all over again!) and small portions.\n If you are a steak lover, you'll find the steak decent, but nothing to rave about. My impression was more of a factory production line, where the waiter asks how you want your steak done - medium rare, medium or well done. They then serve you from a tray of pre-cooked meats, rather than prepare your food individually.\n The result can be disappointing, as the meat is at times luke warm, and the standards can vary.\n I was rather incensed that the waiter served me a very small portion of beef, and gave a much larger portion to the couple beside me. We were all paying the same price! Not only that, when we were given the choice of a 2nd (and final) helping, my portions remained small! Call it bad luck, but I was NOT impressed.\n To be fair, they made very good thin cut fries, and you could have as many servings as you desired. But I was hardly there for the fries, and had not intended to fill myself with a stomachful of oily high-caloried potatoes!\n If you're after good steak, by all means try this venue since it's received a lot of thumbs up from other patrons. But I doubt you'll leave feeling much impressed - it's one of those been there, done that experiences. I won't be going back."

So after munching on baguettes for a month I found three GO-TO places in Paris: a Lebanese restaurant where no one spoke French or English, a breakfast place called Breakfast In America (#1 and #2) and L'Entrec\u00f4te. \nI just had dinner at L'Entrec\u00f4te in London and it brought back all the fantastic memories of when I used to dine at the Paris location. \nThe menu is simple. Sliced steak and fries...and if you want, a second order of the same. A salad to start and wine. You don't have any real choices, which is great when you just want to eat. \nExpect a line, and it's really cramped quarters, but that's a part of the experience.

When you sit down, you get a starter salad with walnuts and some bread. Once that's done, you'll be served steak with some amazing sauce and seriously yummy fries. My favourite part is when they come back for a second round and give you more steak and slather it with more sauce. My kind of heaven. Dessert is where you can pick what you want, traditional French desserts like creme brulee, profiteroles or sorbet. I went with the Vacherin, a towering mound of meringue, ice-cream and chocolate sauce. You get lots of jealous looks too.\n Prices are fairly reasonable - all up I paid about \u00a330 (includes 1 glass of wine and dessert).

Across, you'll find Ippudo, a world-renowned ramen chain that has hours-long waits in its NYC shops, sitting slightly emptier. Has Kanada-Ya taken the throne away from them in London? Maybe.\nI waited about 15 minutes on a Tuesday night. It is a very small, quaint corner restaurant that can fit less than 40 people. As I was approaching the from across the street, I could already smell the heavy truffle aroma from their popular Truffle Ramen from the swinging door. The patrons leaving, too, smelled like truffles as they dashed past me. Being a truffle fanatic, I was so pumped for the Truffle Ramen.\nI'm no ramen expert but this was far from the best ramen I've ever had. You might like this if you like light broths, but it's not creamy at all. The truffle oil felt more like it was there for the smell, and maybe some flavor. The pork was a bit on the dry side and took me awhile to get through. For the most expensive ramen on the menu (\u00a314), I wish they'd included a Hanjuku egg or something because it felt...plain. Kanada-Ya is definitely overhyped. I can't speak for Ippudo in London, but I try to avoid it altogether like a plague since it's overhyped in NYC. London doesn't seem to have a very competitive ramen scene and that's sorta sad, given how many trendy Japanese restaurants there are in the area, I might as well have just gone to Japan Centre."

It salt level wasn't too high, and it certainly packed a punch! However, the noodles certainly let the meal down. It lacked that special pizzaz that great ramen-yas have. \nThe two redeeming factors were the meat and the char siu don. The meat was absolutely amazing; so soft like I was eating clouds. It was juicy and OMG my mouth is now watering just thinking about it. The char siu don (using the same meat) was equally as good. \nAs weird as this sounds, if I go back in the future, it would definitely be to just crush three of those char siu dons."

The turnover is quite fast so don't be too intimated by the amount of people. \nThe food comes out ridiculously fast. I got the only in London ramen and my husband got the truffle. The ramen is pretty bare bones in terms of toppings. If you want anything like an egg or garlic oil it's extra. You can pick your noodle toughness which is nice. Portion is just right so you can order something else. The broth is really thick and flavorful. I personally enjoyed the charsu and I normally don't.  \nKaraage was pretty good. 4 pounds for three decent sized pieces.

I would even budget more stomach room for more eggs! Also ordered the chasu with garlic oil and egg. Both were amazing with hard noodles. The noodles are thinner than most ramen places.

After eating at Kanada-Ya, I have to say that if this is the best that London has to offer, I feel really bad for people who live in London. \nI decided to come to Kanada-Ya at the last moment, so when I got there about 15 minutes after they opened, there was already a line of about 20 people waiting to get inside. I waited about 20-25 minutes and was allowed inside. Because we were given menus while waiting in line, before I even sat down, I placed an order for the tonkatsu X ramen with noodles cooked hard, umeboshi onigiri and the chicken karaage. I figured that if I was only to come once, I was going to order everything I wanted to try. \nThe food came out relatively quickly. The chicken karaage came out first and was the highlight of the meal (that's sad considering that the ramen is supposed to be the highlight). It was crispy, very well seasoned, and the dipping mayo was very good. I highly recommend you order this when you are here. It was a reasonable portion for the price. \nThe ramen came next. I prefer the thicker ramen noodles, and these were the thin kind. The broth didn't taste very special. They claim that this broth takes a really long time to develop, etc., but it really doesn't taste like 20 hour (or however long) broth. There were no complex flavors that you would come to expect from a broth that took so long to make. The char siu was pretty good, but when I eat ramen, I expect the broth to be the highlight. \nI don't recommend the umeboshi onigiri. I grew up eating umeboshi and they give you the large, cheap, sour kind, not the expensive honey somewhat sweet and sour kind of umeboshi. Sure they were big, but definitely not worth the price. But honestly, what did I expect from a place that specializes in ramen.\nIf there is a line for this joint, I recommend going to the Ippudo across the street with no line. There is no reason for you to stand outside in the freezing cold (if it's winter) for 20-30 minutes to eat a bowl of subpar ramen. My friend did try this place out before me, and suggested I not go because this was nothing special, but I didn't listen to him because I just love ramen."

We got seated in about 20 minutes which was much better than I expected. I got the truffle ramen and my boyfriend got the Tonkotsu-X, and we split a chicken karaage. This was too much food for the both of us but I really liked the chicken (not overly fried or oily). My ramen was good, but not amazing. I love truffle but I actually didn't really like it in my ramen, but the Tonkotsu-X was great. The ramen also doesn't come with an egg so make sure to add one if you want!

The broth they use is a classic and you can tell that they brew it for over 10 hours with pork. I absolutely love this style of heavy broth, it gives the ramen a richness that is quite unique compared to other styles of noodles.

I went there with the intent of having a nice bowl of ramen, but they were out of char siu, which doesn't make much sense for a ramen house since char siu is such an integral part of the dish in general. Every single one of their bowls contains char siu, and the Yelp photos suggest hearty portions, and to not have it available is like saying they're out of ramen broth or noodles, hence my reasoning for just ordering a few sides at that time.\nWhen time came to pay the bill, I was told by the staff that if I want to ever dine there again, I have to order ramen. Okay, that makes sense, and I came with the intent of having ramen but decided against it since I would be paying full-price for a meal that lacked an integral part of its essence: the thick slices of char siu.

If not, you will need to wait for one (or more if in a group) to finish the first round before the line starts moving.  The queue here is definitely long especially on a weekend.  I arrived 20 minutes before it opened and there were already at least 20 people queuing.  When it was time to open, I guesstimated that there were about at least 60 people waiting in line.  You definitely need to come early or you will have to wait in line.  \nThis place is a no fuss, quick and efficient place with a quick turnaround like a pure ramen bar in Japan.  The menu is also very short so you will already know what you want by the time you sit down.  I suggest when you sit down, order straight away.  They expect you to eat and leave so best not to hang around too long.  I got in alone bang on at 12noon and out 20 minutes after.  That's how quick it was.  \nThe noodles was cooked to your liking and this is what I love about this place.  I suggest the extra hard noodle so it is 'al dente'.  A lot of other ramen place has the noodles cooked too long and soft which is not what I like.  The broth is simply the best in the city and it leaves you wanting more.  Rich, creamy, smooth and so much flavour.  Do not bother with the sides as they are not worth it.  Just go straight for the ramen.

I was able to finish the broth. Yuzu has that extra kick in it with a slight citrus (note: not lemon or lime.) More of a tart, pepper zesty taste. It cuts through the richness of the tonkotsu broth. Perfect for me. My fianc\u00e9 had the gekikara and wow. The minced beef adds a deeper taste of beef to the broth. I think I have to get it the next time I go. \nI was able to come here twice on my trip. First time I had tonkotsu x and fianc\u00e9 had yuzu. Second time I had yuzu and he had gekikara. Next time I'll have gekikara and he will have..??? :) probably spicy miso!  \nAlso I'm usually not a fan of chicken karaage. Actually I don't like it at all. BUT I tried it and it is better than most other ones I've tried. Not oily and very crunchy. Their onigiri also comes out hot! Very homey in the winter time."

Put it this way Ippudo is right across the street and I did not go there. Why? Because a line started to form before they opened so I walked over and started speaking to the locals and they said by far Kanada-Ya was better and I have to agree. This broth is so rich.. The broth is simmered with pork bones for 18 hours and you can really tell. \nI ordered the classic and just added eggs which were perfectly cooked, you know what im talking about, that dark yellow runny yolk in the center mmmm. It was perfect for the chilly 40 degree weather in London. Im a westerner I use fahrenheit so excuse me lol. I also got a side of spicy miso and added a little to spice it up! \nKanada-Ya you guys know how to cook up a bowl of delicious, comforting ramen! Definitely recommend!!!"

Spicy, with citrus and a buttery lobster-like broth. I ordered the egg add-on which was good, but not a game changer. The odd thing about this place is that they don't have takeaway containers that you can carry leftover ramen home in, so skip the appetizer and come hungry so you can eat every last bit of your ramen. This is a must-return spot."

    "review": "I love Ramen. Whenever I have the opportunity to try out a new ramen spot, I go for it, so naturally, I couldn't just leave this one out. Having read a lot about this restaurant I wasn't sure what to expect and whether it would be the real deal or just a massively overhyped tourist-trap. Now that I've been there, I do believe the hype.\nThe first thing that caught my attention was the line in front of the restaurant, which is perfectly normal in Japan but rare to come across in the West. Like in Japan, you are handed the menu in advance so you can already decide on what you want before getting a seat as the line moves rather quickly. We opted for a classic Tonkotsu Ramen, a spicy Yuzu Tonkotsu and some Karaage (fried chicken) as a side.\nI wasn't sure what to expect from the Yuzu Tonkotsu but it was absolutely delicious. The acidity added by the Yuzu was just right, combined with a hint of spiciness it nicely balanced out the fatty broth, adding a little freshness to an otherwise hearty and earthy dish. While the soups were stellar, what really stole the show was the Karaage. Coming with Yuzu-flavored mayo and a slightly spicy batter, the fried chicken was modeled after the flavor profile of the spicy Tonkotsu, which worked great. The meat was super juicy, and perfectly cooked through while the spices didn't distract too much from the chicken itself. Probably the best fried chicken I've had in my life.\nIf you like Ramen and you're in London, I'd highly recommend giving this one a try."

    "review": "Super tiny ramen shop located right across the street from Ippudo and likely to have a queue during peak lunch and dinner hours. I came here at 1:30-2:00 pm on a weekday by myself and didn't have to wait which was awesome.\nIt's easy to make a decision on what to order since they don't have a very extensive menu. They make a few things very well. They serve some karage, some other appetizers, and 4-5 types of ramen. I got the Tonkatsu ramen, added some spicy miso paste (which came in a spoon so you could control how much you wanted to add), and added an egg. I like that you can specify the texture of the noodles (hard, medium, or soft).\nThe broth was rich and flavorful, and the noodles were perfectly al dente, and it was certainly one of the better bowls of ramen that I've had. But having just eaten at Ippudo in NY the week before, I just preferred Ippudo a touch more. I'd wait for this ramen again for ~30 min, but not sure I'd wait 1+ hour for this. Perfect for a grey, cold, blustery day. My total for the ramen, spicy miso paste, and egg was \u00a316 so it's not exactly cheap, and it seemed to be smaller than the Ippudo NY ramen I had.\nCome solo or with only one other person, and be prepared to eat communally at the bar or a long table. The space is small and fits only ~30 people, so if you have a party of 4+, go elsewhere!"

    "review": "We continued our venture of Ramen in central London and we went to their original branch.\nThe menu is as small as the restaurant, with a choice of only 4 types of ramen. As we went as a party of 4, we got to order all of them to try.\nOriginal Ramen (\u00a310.50) - The Original Ramen at Kanada-Ya forms the basis to all their ramens and what you see is what you get! A generous portion of ramen noodles served with an 18-hour pork bone broth, topped with slices of chashu pork belly, wood ear fungus, nori (seaweed) and spring onion. The menu also says there's a secret sauce in this, not sure what it was, but it definitely tasted great! The broth was intense and full of flavour. The slices of chashu pork were melt-in-your-mouth tender. All the different toppings not only made the bowl of ramen pretty, they also added to the overall flavour and texture. If you like the simple things in life, then you won't go wrong with this Original!\nMoyashi Ramen (\u00a311.50) - the Original Ramen, topped with steamed beansprouts. This is one for those of you that like a bit of veg in your ramen. The steamed beansprouts were just cooked, so they still had a bit of crunch to them.\nChashu-Men (\u00a313.00) - the Original Ramen, but instead of the pork belly slices, you get massive pork collar slices. The pork collar had just the right amount of fat, evenly distributed across the meat. Which means it was super tender, but also had a bit of bite to it.\nGekikara Ramen (\u00a313.00) - Served with spicy 'tan tan' style minced pork and pork belly chashu. This is perfect for those that like a bit of a kick in their ramen. As you can see, it's pork mince, with pork belly slices, in a pork bone broth. So this is pretty porky! The spiciness isn't too overpowering, so you can still taste all the different levels of flavours from the ramen.\nWe also had a side dish of Karaage (\u00a36.50) - which were deep fried chunks of chicken, served with creamy Japanese mayonnaise. These were super crispy and moist. The seasoning was in the coating and on the chicken itself. So we could tell they were freshly cooked for us. Extremely yummy and a must try if you come to Kanada-Ya. We think they would've tasted even better if they were spicy tough.\nAlthough the ramen was nice, the broth could've been more intense. We also felt that the ramen needed the additional toppings of the pickles, garlic and sesame to really bring it to life."

Always get Hanjuku Egg to accompany your ramen, the way Kanada-Ya boils these eggs is amazing.\nTo accompany this incredibly tasty ramen I always have a Calipis to drink, and Salmon Onigiri and Karaage as sides. \nSeriously, there is no better ramen in London.

The place isn't huge but they utilized the space very well to maximize the number of people they can seat. We got an order of karaage to share, along with a bowl of ramen for each. They also serve onigiri, but it would've been too much food for us. I told my boyfriend that the ramen was comparable to the ones we had in Japan.

In fairness it wasn't that long a wait (maybe 20mins)\nOnce inside you see the reason for the line.... It's really small. Comfortable but small. To maximise the seating, you will probably have to share a table. If your a group of 3-4 be prepared for a longer wait and bigger groups..... At your own peril!!!\nThe Ramen... This is what it's all about! The standard product is as good as the reviews make it out great broth, good noodles (choose how they are cooked) and great additional ingredients. Make sure you read what comes as standard though as I didn't and it meant I missed out on the egg (in most other places this comes as standard) I couldn't be bothered to order it after the ramen arrived . Btw, it comes out quick!! We also had a side of carage chicken, not the best but ok.\nThe service is economicical, but you won't be in there long enough to have any complaints...

Today was the soft opening, and although it wasn't perfect, it was still pretty damn good.\nThe Goooooood:\n- The soup is rich, thick Tonkotsu and is really, really tasty. I thought this was one of the best Tonkotsu soups I've tried in London. \n- The spicy miso paste was also good. One portion was enough to spice up both of our bowls. Seriously yum.\n- You can add extra noodles if you run out and are still hungry.\n- The service was really friendly and sweet, despite the madness of people queuing around the block.\nThe saaaaad:\n- Tonkotsu was the only option today. I'm not sure if they'll add more broths later, if not, don't bring veggy friends or non-pork-eating friends.\n- Even though there was only one broth on the menu they ran out of looooads of options. I was planning to have an egg and the black garlic sauce, but they ran out before 7pm. Boo.\n- They gave us the option of hard or soft ramen. We chose hard, but our ramen were pretty normal (not particularly al dente.) They weren't bad, but they weren't \"hard\". \n- Hopefully they'll improve the ordering system, as we had to ask for our spicy miso twice, and it took aaages for drinks to appear. We'd finished half our ramen before drinks and miso arrived. Doh!\nI think I'll have to come back once they have opened properly to see if it gets even better. For now (as the soup was sooooo good) I'd give them 4 stars for flavour and 2 stars for service.\n* It's 50% off during the soft opening, so do go and try it!\n* Get there early before they run out of everything!!"

There isn't even a vegetarian option. Now this doesn't hugely bother me, but it does mean that I simply cannot go to this place when I am with a significant proportion of my friends who do not eat pork.\nThe friend who introduced me to this place told me that ramen is only supposed to come in pork varieties.

Felt like I was in Tokyo again.\nOne neat aspect of this 24-seater restaurant is the way they handle their queue of customers. There are two benches outside of the restaurant, positioned end-to-end to create one long bench. If you see people sitting on the bench, then there is a queue, so follow these guidelines to join and \"work\" the queue: People seated on the bench closest to the door are at the front of the queue and people seated furthest away from the door are at the end of queue. As people from the front of the queue are seated in the restaurant, everyone on the bench slides down toward the door. Don't bother asking the hostess for available tables, just get in the queue.\nSecondary impressions were good - diners seemed to be enjoying themselves slurping their bowls and such.\nTertiary impressions were just OK - I found \u00a311.50 for a bowl of Moyashi Ramen a bit too expensive. On a good day, the bowl was worth \u00a38. Why? The lack of pork. There were three small and thin slices, possibly an ounce in total weight.

The sliced pork on top was the absolute best pork I've had ok ramen. It was so sweet and tasty, like it had been marinated for a long time. I'm weird about meat on ramen, so this is a huge win for me. Actually, I liked ALL the toppings. I ordered the noodles hard, which kept them nice and firm, as it takes me awhile to eat ramen. I also got the chicken karaage, which was AMAZING!! There was a bit of a line when I arrived, but I was seated within about 10 min and had my food 1 min after I ordered. This place is so much better than Bone Daddies, which was definitely a 2-3 star for taste, atmosphere, and service."

    "review": "Yes, I gave into the hype and stood in line for Kanda-Ya. In attempt to be strategic, I went for a late lunch around 14:00. Even staving off my interest and hunger, I did wait around 15 -20 minutes. I will give the staff credit; they treated seating like a competitive game of Tetris. Eating solo? Don't expect to sit at your own table. In fact, you are likely to end up at a four top with a group of three. Who doesn't love communal dining? \nWho cares, let's get on to the food!\n* Sake Onigiri - I know, I know, I was there for the Ramen. It was late, I was hungry! It was a moment of weakness. I would describe it as light on salmon. Luckily, I really (really, really) like rice.  My recommendation, wait for the Ramen. \n* Original Ramen - I thought the fairest way to judge the restaurant was to order \nthe OG:\nLet's break it down:\no Noodle -The portions were plentiful and the noodles seemed freshly made.  The most genius part is you select the level of al dente that you would like your noodles cooked to.  If you don't like your noodles, that's on you. \no Broth - Rich and velvety. I like the noodles better, but perhaps you are catching  on to my love affair with empty carbs.\no Pork - Dee-lish! The pork was thinly cut. I find that often thinly cut pork dries out. Not here. The meat was nicely marbled with fat and super moist.\no Overall - Super delicious\n* Moyashi Ramen + Egg - My companion was fancier and went for the Moyashi Ramen plus an egg.  From what I can tell, the difference between the Moyashi Ramen and the Original Ramen is blanched beansprouts. To me no person would spend an additional \u00a31 for beansprouts; I stood corrected.  \no The egg - My companion was adamant that the egg is the most important part. This egg was apparently very good. I quote \"perhaps even better than Bone Daddy's\". She did not offer to share, which could be interpreted as rude.\n* Spicy Miso - oh wait... they ran out! I am convinced that a spicy sauce would have taken the broth over the top. \n* Black garlic sauce - it was good, but you know it was no spicy Miso!"

    "review": "Kanada-Ya is hands down one of the best ramen places ever. The first time I walked by, a breeze carried the scent of freshly made noodles (yes that floury, doughy smell like freshly baked bread, except for noodles) right to me, and I knew that I had to go for a bowl of ramen.\nI always get the original ramen for around \u00a311. The broth was one of the richest broths I've ever tasted! It tasted like they melted down those pork bones and made it into soup. You can choose the firmness of the noodles, I usually go for the recommended option. The chashu on top is very tender and I like all the other veggies they put on top too. They have this green spicy pickled veggie thing on the side for free and I like to add a spoonful to my ramen for a spicy kick. Sometimes, I split an extra order of noodles with a friend when I finish my noodles but there's still broth left. \nThe chicken karaage is also quite good. It was \u00a36 and they give you around 6 big pieces. It's pretty standard so while it was really good, it's nothing extraordinary compared to other places. \nMy only complaint is that there's always ALWAYS a line when I pass by (up to 2 hours one time) and there's only around a dozen seats in the restaurant. But that how you know it's good right?"

    "review": "Good grief, or yoi kanashimi, since we're talking ramen. Some Yelpers comments are out of line IMO. That said, I'm giving them a 4 for London (If we were in Japan I'd give them a 3). London is an expensive place to run a shop (and yes!, more expensive than in Tokyo IMO) so \u00a310 for a bowl of ramen is sadly reasonable around here.   \nUnderstand: Kanada-Ya makes Hakata ramen. This is a style that is pork based, has a milky white colour, and is full of delicious, yummy, lip-sticking collagen and fat. And remember, fat does not make you fat, carbs and sugar do. So if you're worried about your waistline why are you even thinking about going out for noodles?\n \nKnow: Kanada-Ya are specialists at what they do. So no, they don't have a gluten-free vegan ramen and they don't have a bar making green tea lychee 'tinis. If you want that go to Bone Daddies or some silly place like that. \nI should add that I'm really appreciative of a specialist and focused ramen place opening up in London that has the discipline and confidence in their cooking to just do one thing really well, instead of trying to offer 20-different mediocre dishes (ahem, Shoryu somewhat, or that London ramen atrocity known as Bento Ramen). Kudos to Kanada-Ya for focus. I hope this becomes more common here.\n/// So the Ramen...\nThe Overall Bowl and Broth: It's good. It's not my personal favourite style, but it's a decent bowl. Overall I think it lacks punch, but again, they have their style and they are working hard at it. I'm going to experiment with some topping combinations next time and see what I can do to fix this.\n \nNoodles: Mine were perfectly cooked to medium. Just like I asked.\nEgg: Again, perfectly done. Not as good as Shoryu, but the eggs there are sublime- as good or better than many I've had in Japan.\nCharshu: Was adequate. I prefer it saltier, but the texture and fat were very good.\nOverall: This place is a welcome addition to London and will force a lot of people to step up their Ramen game. They will also keep Ippudo - who is about to open across the street - on their toes. While the service was a bit spotty, I'm willing to overlook this for now and chalk it up to them being new."

    "review": "Kanada-Ya is definitely a ramen place worth the wait! There is always a line for it, since the venue is quite small, but the Chashu Men Ramen is amazing. I ordered it with a Hanjuku Egg that was very well prepared as well. The ramen broth is a perfect level of saltiness and savoriness. I usually feel like ramen broth leaves me very thirsty, but this broth was not overdone at all. Additionally, the Hanjuku Egg was very well made in the sense that the yolk was not too dry or too runny. I would definitely suggest this place to any ramen lover!\nADVICE: There will be a line! Bring a coat because the line is outdoors. There will be a coat rack inside where you can hang up your coat when you're eating. Additionally, be prepared to share a table with someone. The venue is very small so you will end up sharing a table with a stranger."

There menu is extremely simple. Three choices: original, with bean sprouts, and with pork collar instead of pork belly. Really, they could have done with one menu selection and just had the bean sprouts and pork collar as add-ons. After you choose your ramen you can choose the firmness of the noodles. I ordered mine firm and added an onsen egg. I also ordered a plain onigiri.\nFirst, forget the onigiri. The rice is good, but the onigiri itself is forgettable. If you're still hungry after your ramen, just get kaedama and order more noodles.\nThe noodles and broth were both excellent. Noodles had a nice, firm bite and the broth was creamy and frothy, without being overly gelatinous. I really appreciated the 5 thick slices of chasiu. Some other London ramen eateries seem to give one or two paper thin slices of chasiu. \nThis is the type of ramen restaurant that you go to, eat your food, and get out. Very different experience from other London ramen eateries, but also a very nice change."

That was until one day my Japanese friend invited me to check out a great ramen place. When I research the restaurant online, I realized that we were going to that line outside the door restaurant. By then, I was really looking forward to checking it out, because Ippudo, another great ramen place, is right next door and this ramen shop can still maintain such strong following, they must be doing something right! \nI got to the restaurant around 1pm and, of course, there was a line outside. Luckily the line moved relatively fast, and within 15 minutes, we got our seat. This is a great place if you have just one or two people going, any size larger than that, you probably should forget about it. The inside of the restaurant is very tiny, and even with very efficient use of space, the whole restaurant can seat about 20 people. No wonder there is always a line outside. \nThe menu is extremely simple: ramen plus choices of toppings and rice balls. I kind of like it. I always have trouble ordering my food when I have too many choices. Here it is simple, order your ramen and how do you like it cooked and add any extra toppings. Go crazy and order a rice ball if you are hungry. I ordered original ramen with Hanjuku eggs. The food came very quickly and, man, that was a good bowl of ramen. The broth was rich and flavorful but not greasy and the ramen was cooked al dente. I swallowed the whole bowl in record time. I felt that I spent more time waiting for my seat than actually eating! However, it is definitely worth the wait."

    "review": "As a ramen junkie, I've been searching for good bowls of ramen everywhere I go. I had heard amazing things about Kanada-Ya, and many claim that it's the best ramen in London, so naturally, I had to go! Also because I'm a huge fan of tonkotsu broths.\nWhen I got there (around 1 PM on a Monday), there was a short queue, but nowhere near the legends that I'd heard of. After a friendly conversation with my fellow line waiters, I was seated in the restaurant.\nTo start out, I orderd an ume nigiri. For my main, I ordered the chashu-men with the mayu (black garlic oil) and hanjuku egg. They let you choose the firmness of the noodles; I chose hard because I like my ramen a tad undercooked (al dente?). They use the traditional thin straight noodles, which pairs well with tonkotsu.\nThe ume nigiri was exactly what I expected, the sourness of the pickled plum perked up my palate and made me excited for the meal to come.\nThey had some pickled kimchi-esque cabbage and ginger for you to just add to your dishes, as well as a toasted sesame seed grinder (which I of course used, generously).\nThe ramen came out pretty quickly and looked great. The broth was very good; one of the best tonkotsu broths I've had anywhere, not just London. The mayu was exactly what the broth needed to elevate it to the next level. The egg was a beautiful golden orange, and the slight sweetness of the marinated egg white was great in the savory and rich pork broth. The chashu was tender and melted away, though I would have preferred a slightly thicker cut, with more of a sear.\nOverall, Kanada-Ya has one of the strongest tonkotsu broths outside of Hakata for sure, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves ramen who is in London. I hope they bring it to NYC soon!"

    "review": "I love noodles and have been eating them at least twice a week, more so in Japan (at least 4-5 a week).  So I have been looking forward to Kanada-Ya's opening.  Sadly I was totally disappointed with their Ramen.  \nWe ordered one Moyashi and one Chashu Ramens.  Their Tonkotsu soup was simmered for 18 hours according to their menu and tasted justifiably so; however it simply lacked depth.  It just tasted congealing pork fat/bones with soya sauce and nothing else much.  Adding lots of black pepper did not help.  Good Tonkotsu soup should have different layers of flavours.  The thin noddle was cloggy/starchy; it should have been boiled in a much larger pot and shaken vigorously to remove as much starchy water as possible.  I didn't see the point of Kikurage (Woodear Fungus) as it only gave texture but was bland.  The only good bit was Chashu in Chashu Men; they (Collar) were leaner than those (Belly) used in other two types of Ramen and tasted as good as you get in Japan.\nThe menu was limited to three types of Tonkotsu Ramen and Rice Balls (Onigiri) and they were way too expensive.  Why the prices of Ramen are so high in London?  You can get very decent ones for around \u00a34-5 in Japan and the quality you find in London does not justify the price tag.  Even in Paris, you can get nicer Ramen for around 7-8 Euros.\nVery disappointing."

As one of the first to arrive at around 12.20 there was still a 40 min wait, but it was damn worth it. Even though staring through the window at all the delicious ramen was tough!\nThe place is tiny. I think I counted around 20-25 seats. Two staff and two cooks.\nWhich was nice as the place had a warm cosy feel to it that would be very nice during the winter months.\nI was going to order the standard ramen (there is not a lot of choice here) but my friend pointed out that they do a special which was detailed on the table. So I ordered the Gekikira Ramen, an \"18 hour pork bone broth, spicy tan tan style minced pork, charshu belly pork, beansprouts, kikurage, negi\" I have no idea what the last two were but it was damn delicious.\nService was quick. And the portions were Good. My previous favourite ramen place Shoryu was always excellent and had you full to bursting. However recently they've cut down on the portion sizes and a super stingy with the toppings.\nNot so here, despite being a little cheaper than Shoryu (minus miso egg which isn't included by default, but a topping) they are quite generous with the meat. I got as much charshu pork belly as I normally get in my Shoryu bowl (note that's pork collar however, a bit more expensive) but I also get here a massive portion of spicy minced pork. Additionally from the orders of the pork collar I saw drifting around whilst Shoryu normally gives you 2-3 really thin slices, here they decorate your whole bowl in the stuff, so you get around 5-6 decently sliced pieces. \nThe broth I haven't mentioned yet is excellent too. It tastes a lot cleaner and clearer than shoryu. Admittedly Shoryu is slightly more flavourful but oh well you can't have everything. Everything else, in terms of ingredients, quality and quantity are spot on.\nWhilst there we also tried the sour plum onigiri. I didn't really like this much but more personal preference than anything. It was presented very nicely and was a decently sized portion. \nThe only real improvement I can say is that they REALLY need another location as just thinking of the inevitable queue is making me sad."

I have always wanted to try it ever since it opened in the fall last year, when I got the invite to the 50% off soft opening but couldn't make it. I have however dined at its rival Ippudo across the street, which is a much more upscale, modern building with a bar area to wait and a cell phone texting service to let you know when your table is ready. By contrast, Kanada-Ya is a lot more like an authentic hole-in-the-wall.  We arrived around 7 PM and took our place in the queue, as the restaurant does not take reservations and it only seats about 25 people inside. There is a nice wooden bench to sit on, and the staff bring out menus for you to look at. The queue also moves fairly fast; there were 5-6 people in front of us to start, and we had our seats inside within 20 minutes.\nWe dined at two seats facing the far wall, near kitchen and the toilets, which wasn't particular scenic, but I don't think that is what they are going for. The menu is pretty straightforward - there are 3 main ramen options then a load of topping options. I went for the moyashi ramen, which is like the original ramen but with beansprouts, and then chose to add a hanjuku egg. For a drink I got the Hiver, a London honey beer. This come serves in a cool copper mug, and it tastes exactly like honey. I was sorely tempted by the onigiri rice balls, and meant to order one, but I forgot and it turned out to be a blessing since I couldn't even finish the ramen. My friend got the original ramen without any toppings, and she actually managed to finish her bowl. \nAs for the food, I thought the bowl was good, but nothing spectacular. The egg was good, runny in the middle and interestingly enough, served cold. I ate them first because I didn't want them to sink into the ramen and lose the deliciousness of the yolk. You have the option of choosing the firmness of your noodles; I went with regular, but they just didn't seem like ramen to me - they were very thin and of dry, lacking the usual plumpness. The meat was tasty... we tried for a while to figure out the difference between pork collar and pork belly, but in the end concluded that you can't go wrong with pork belly. Aside from a ton of vegetables, the only other thing to note was the broth - it was good and not too salty. We added some of the mysterious looking pickles on the table halfway through the meal, which turned it actually quite spicy. Overall, it was not a bad meal, but there was nothing screaming at me to declare that this is the best bowl of ramen in London."

To that end, I was very surprised to see that new ramen restaurant Kanada-Ya have sited themselves right opposite the newly opened 2 storey behemoth international ramen restaurant chain Ippudo\nTo be fair, Kanada-Ya is also an international chain with Japanese founder Kanada Kazuhiro bringing his authentic tonkotsu ramen from Yukuhashi, Japan to the world. However, the dimunitive premises of Kanada-Ya does make it feel like a David v Goliath situation between the neighbouring restaurants\nHaving said that, there was a healthy queue outside Kanada-Ya 15 minutes before opening time on the Saturday lunchtime when I visited. In fact, when the restaurant opened, people at the back of the queue had to wait as all the seats were quickly filled up\nThe menu is short and sweet - 3 versions of tonkotsu ramen, the main difference between the bowls being the cut of pork to make the chashu and a few extra ingredients like beansprouts\nI went for the original ramen, which came with the 18 hour pork broth, chashu pork belly, wood ear fungus, nori and spring onion. None the options came with an egg, so I added a hanjuku egg for \u00a31.80\nKanada-Ya's USP is that they wash the pork bones before using to make the broth. It perhaps made the broth taste a tiny bit more sanitised but being someone who feels that the broth is the most important element of ramen, I did enjoy it but perhaps not as much as Bone Daddies where I usually drink most of it whereas here, I left a lot of it behind\nMy noodles came 'normal' as requested, which were fine for me. The chashu pork belly was suitably moist if rather thin. The wood ear fungus added texture and I was glad there were no beansprouts (I'm looking at you, Shoryu!)\nThe bowl here is certainly worthy of entering my top 4 ramen restaurant rotation alongside Bone Daddies, Ippudo and Cocoro but my favourite still remains Bone Daddies, who also have the amazing Korean guinea fowl and sticky bones\nKanada-Ya only serve onigiri rice balls alongside their ramen but I didn't try any on this occasion"

Both the food and the service were top notch.\nThe food: We had the chashu-men ramen and the tonkatsu ramen and both were some of the best I've had. I don't pretend to be a ramen connoisseur but I've been to a half dozen ramen places in the United States and tasted bad ramen and good. The ramen here is as good as the best I've had yet.\nPrice: It's a little steep for what it is. The chashu ramen is 13 pounds and the tonkatsu is 10.5, and if you want an egg in it that's 2 pounds extra; though that egg is tasty and adds a hearty flavor to the dish so you might as well go for it. There is a 10% service charge added to the bill automatically.\nThe location: It's a corner shop so it's easy enough to find once you get close, though it's not exactly close to a metro station. The place is very small though and seating is limited. We had to wait outside for a few minutes but the person at the door will happily hand you a menu to look at while you wait.\nThe service: I save this category for last because it so blew me out of the water. I've been to many European countries over the years and eaten a lot of different places and I have never had a server offer to refill my non-tea/coffee drink for free. I assumed that refilled drinks were simply a custom in the United States alone. Heck, you are lucky if a waiter even drops by your table after the food is delivered to check that everything is alright. Today I was proven wrong as helpful staff (more than just one) came by our table not once, not twice, but three times in our roughly 30 minute meal to not only check that everything was to our pleasure but also refill our water: the free tap water we were drinking. \nI legitimately felt bad that I didn't have enough hard cash on me (we were paying by card) to pay for an exceedingly generous tip but I left them all I had (a little under a pound). If you are there and have as good an experience as I did leave a few extra pence for me."

    "review": "This new ramen place is popular and rightly so.  The menu is smaller than most places, but this just means that they have concentrated on the best ramen and they are good at it.  These guys are the experts.\nWe both had the Chasiu men, which comes with slices of pork all around the top of the bowl and wood ear fungus.  This has an interesting texture.  I like how you can have the noodles cooked to your liking - I had mine cooked medium and my wife chose the hard noodles (cooked for less time, which gives a firmer bite).  This is the only place I have noticed this, on my ramen travels.\nI observed the guys at the table near us both going for extra noodles. We thought they must be hungry!  But, it was definitely the right call as we both had a lot of tasty broth left at the end.  It is like having a 2nd ramen which, of course, I am in favour of.\nThe restaurant is a short walk away from Tottenham Court Road tube station, but Holborn is another nearby option.  We got there late on Saturday night and there was a line outside.  It was a chilly night, but there were some heaters on full whack, so we were comfortable.  Almost too warm even.  I liked how a member of staff would let us know how long the likely wait was and whether we would make it in before closing time (10pm on Saturday).\nI expect that we will be back again, particularly as we are often in the Soho/Covent Garden area and it is a winter season treat.  Highly recommended."

Especially cha-shu is the best in London... But of course, you would not be there for cha shu only.., without good soup, a bowl of ramen would never taste right... By the way, it's kikurage - tree grown mushroom, is supposedly specially cured from japan... It tasted not too special - too coarsely chopped and too big in my opinion..."

OMG.. i can drink the broth like theres no tomorrow haha. definitely should try this ramen when you come near holborn\nthe second time i came here i tried gekikara ramen (which is on their extra menu) i prefer the original one since i cant take spicy because they put a lot of chili ( i think) until the broth became red. but the good part is that they add shredded pork which is very sweet and tender i love it! overall i'll give 5/5"

It's awesome.  Even though I've had to wait an hour for my ramen on one occasion, it's still awesome (beware, there are queues at lunchtime too).\nKanada-Ya is the David to Ippudo's Goliath bearing down on it from across the street in the premises formerly containing Damson Cafe.  There's not a lot of seating (maybe room for 25-30 people at a time?) and is perpetually steamy, thanks to the small soup area (to call it an exposition kitchen would be generous, it's pretty dinky).\nAnyhow.  Kanada-Ya does very few things - tonkotsu ramen and onigiri (and ramune, for those of you into that sort of thing) - but it does them extremely well.  My standard order there is the chashu men (tonkotsu with the bowl rim lined with pork, fungus, and nori) with extra black garlic oil (highly recommended for all orders) and a hanjuku egg - it's a shame the egg doesn't come as standard, but never mind.  Also, you get to choose your noodle hardness (I go for extra hard just like my...abs) which is tripleplusgood: the noodles here are the thin Hakata-type - whilst I generally prefer thicker noodles, getting to choose noodle hardness really puts Kanada-ya up in my estimation.  The broth is delicious - I've been mulling it over, but I think the broth flavour just about pips Bone Daddies (there, I said it).  Simply put, one of the best bowls of ramen I've had - whilst I haven't been to Ippudo in London, I have been to a branch in Kuala Lumpur and Kanada-ya's is far superior.\nYes, the service is pretty haphazard.  But for me the ramen erases any bad feeling I may have about the place; besides, it's not like the staff are rude - it's more a case of inefficiency and hopefully will improve over time.\nWe're really spoiled for ramen in London.  Really spoiled.  It's an awesome time to be here."

I ordered the Chashu Men and it was quite delicious. The broth is flavorful as expected, but I do find the frothiness a bit strange... I expected the chashu collar to be a bit more marbled and felt that it was bit too sweet for my taste. Maybe I should have opted for the pork belly instead. The noodles were good.

They prepared a new table for me and their suave staff's baroque politeness was beautifully theatrical as I absorbed the London vibe, fantastic.\nFirst meal was fish, some veggies a salad?

These slider-sized donuts are filled with crab and topped with coral dusting. A great balance of sweet and savory to start the meal off.\n// Firehouse Caesar (\u00a312) - 3 stars\nWhat separates this dish out from all the other Caesar salads is the crispy chicken skin they include. Flavor-wise, I didn't think it was anything special though.\n// Spiced Cornish Crab & Lobster Omelette (\u00a326) - 4 stars\nThis is not your typical scrambled omelette. As seen in the picture, the ingredients actually sit on top of the eggs rather than being mixed in. The coral mayo helped pull all the components together, with the shiso leaves adding in a nice touch.\n// Frozen Apple Panna Cotta (\u00a39) - 5 stars\nI debated for the longest time whether or not to order this dessert, but I'm sure glad I went for it.

We tried to increase our group size to 4pax at the very last minute over the phone but were politely rejected. So don't just show up with a +1 at the door, you might not even get your table. \nUpon arrival they ushered me to the table and took my coats and jackets. Immediately sat me down and made me comfy. Then proceeded to recommend me a cocktail which would pair well with our food. I enjoyed my first experience so much that I decided to make a second comeback with my partner for a Christmas brunch over the weekend. It took me about a good month in advance to book a slot, dinner slots were completely wiped out till 2017. \nI must say I was a little disappointed with their service the second time around. I did not receive the same hospitality as I did for dinner. The staff seem a little flustered that day, nothing was really offered nor recommended to us. It felt like that they were a little short handed. What a shame though, I was hoping to give my partner the same level of experience I had the first time but it wasn't up to that level.

For a main, I went with the gnocchi, which was accompanied by a flawless presentation of taleggio, raisins, spring peas, and rounds of fennel. It was spring on a plate, and I am still thinking about it 2 weeks later."

They were out of the burrata appetizer, which was a bummer. The grilled octopus was just ok as was the mushroom/egg appetizer. My chicken was weird tasting and my husbands lamb was Ok. Everything was super small. I did enjoy the tarte tatin for dessert. I wouldn't come back."

Food was great, service was spot on and atmosphere was really fun. Met some cool people sitting next to us and decided to get the check and go to the bar in the hotel attached,also apart of chiltern firehouse. This is where the whole night took a wild turn. \nAfter we got in ,the hostess, Amy Cuff, came up and notified us we would only be allowed one drink and would need to leave immediately after because the bar was \"private\" and since the hotel was packed they \"needed the room\" for hotel guests. Which we were with. \nJust FYI. The bar was empty....\nWe tried to order another dink from the EMPTY bar and the bartender said very apologetically the hostess notified him we were allowed one drink and then require to leave. \nBirthday ruined. Never coming back. Ladder Shed London. You failed."

Service was good but slow. Started with super stiff excellent drinks -- gin & tonic and old fashioned. Had to have second each despite generous pour. Then shared spiced watermelon, steak tartare & Iberian bbq pork. Could have order seconds on all but instead tried four desserts, all fab. Would we come again?

I was dining alone on vacation and informed them to offer me a spot at the bar or whatever they had a available.  I was able to sit at the chefs counter and get a full on show of them cooking everyones food.  I have to say the place inside and out was gorgeous and the service was great.  Yes, it's a bit pricey and that's why I have given 4 stars because I'm not sure if the food equals out to the hefty tag.  The food looks delicious and is prepared in detail but my salmon was a little too firm, as was the roe on it and the crab donuts were good but not spectacular.  I also had a chocolate cake which was delicious.  Overall great experience to check off the London bucket list but not sure I would immediately rush back next time I'm in town."

It's a great place for people watching!\nThe three of us ordered the fish dishes, which were divine. We had a really great bottle of wine and the sashimi appetizer as well.

Really great.\nCrab-stuffed Donuts:  Not the best...  seemed to struggle to go together.\nFried Chicken:  Seriously amazing.

Obviously forgetful.\nI have a huge pet peeve about restaurants serving a very limited set menu for larger parties, so great that these guys gave us a really comprehensive and varied tour around their menu.  Much appreciated.\nOne critique is that the whole thing could have been salted a bit more.  Other than that, really a perfect meal.

The interior is beautiful, with an heir of classic French brasserie but with a contemporary London twist. Reservations are a must considering the hefty crowd during peak hours. The service was top notch from start to finish, and our server was very knowledgable on the menu and helped us on deciding what to order. We had the cornbread appetizer as well as a salad to start, both delicious. The short rib entree was wonderful and beautifully cooked. My favorite thing on the menu however was the black truffle polenta, very unique and sinful. Dessert consisted of some sort of cake with an ice cream that was also very good. I thoroughly enjoyed the Firehouse; everything from the food, to the service, to the ambience was just fabulous. Definitely one of the highlights of my trip to London."

My last trip through the UK and it's my first meal in town after a long ass flight. My hotel isnt ready so i get on the tube and lo and behold the station i need is closed. Ive got a large backpack and jacket and as i exit the next station to circle back and then walk a few K its getting hot. Of all the times in London for this to happen..\nI walk to the streets and finally get there. Im shown to a space that is looking right at the pass. Perfect. Ive been up for 20 hours and can finally settle. It turns out my server is an ex Dinex guy and worked for Daniel and his mix of restos in NYC. Good start. Im watching as they furiously plate and cook, and expedite. This is a furiously busy kitchen. I then meet Sebastian one of the sous chefs and he's talking about his time traveling, cooking and finally ending up at Chiltern. He makes some suggestions and im on my way. For some reason there's a mix up and someone  approaches with a Bloody Mary. Ive been up way too long but im sure i didnt order it. But What the hell i said id take it anyways if it didnt belong to another ticket. I dont generally like them but realized after how excellent the first sip was that ive been drinking sub par ones for who knows how long. Score.\nMy food starts coming out and a couple of older dodded up ladies sit near me then start complaining about how they want a booth and were disappointed in that thats what they shouldve had. My server takes it graciously and says he'll talk to the reservationists. They are moved soon after. Thank goodness. Dont think i could have dealt with that. I have a chat with my server and he says the place has become somewhat of a hot spot and that people come to be seen and watch. As someone who's here for a Michelin starred chefs cooking, the best seats are at the pass! Soon a gentleman is sat next to me and we agree on the same topic. Turns out he's just as obsessive with food as i am and is a regular here. I recommend the carrot dessert which is unusual, complex and ultimately delicious. We are now food allies.\nAside from the carrot dessert, the beef and veggie hash and the dry aged burger and fries are fantastic, comforting and have their own delicious twist. Service was excellent and as someone who is not famous and was treated very well. I think having a rapport with the kitchen also helped greatly but when it's about the food, that's how you focus. I guess if youre a scene person, just dont act like those ladies..."

The food was flavoursome but portions are small for the price. I ordered the eggs florentine and my friend ordered the eggs Benedict. The eggs florentine was flavoursome but I can't attest to saying it was anything out of the ordinary.

    "review": "Booking: Either the mass panic bookings of 2014 have passed, or I was one of the lucky ones that didn't seem to have a problem getting a table for Dinner at Chiltern Firehouse. Was offered a place at the Chef's Counter on the phone, which I took (and recommend you ask for!). \nArrival: Staff were friendly and courteous, and we grabbed some champagne at the bar while our table was being readied. Apart from quite a few Russian oligarchs, the bar was wells stocked with 12, 18 and 25year Japanese whiskeys, and some decent champagne options.\nSearing: We were originally sat at a normal table, but pushed correctly to be placed as booked at Chef Counter. CC is a little less formal, and requires sitting on a high stool with less leg room; so if you have a long leggy date (in a dress or otherwise) you may want to save it for next time. That said, it's the best table at the Firehouse; watching the speed and precision of the appetiser area, with the giant meat grill & smoking each behind, was a great conversation piece. The chef's ears perked up while we were chatting about what he was doing, and gave us a taste while explaining everything. The man was insanely busy, so that small gesture was truly special.\nFood: \n+ Crab Donuts have a well earned reputation as a 'must have'. Only three of them but delicious.\n+ Streak Tartare: a late summer sun sat on the tartare, that you beat into each other to give a very rich dish. The Firehouse hot sauce, a smoked spicy apple flavour, was insanely delicious. I would literally buy bottles of it alone. \n+ Calamari: now off the summer menu, it was still delicious, fresh and not even remotely rubbery.\n+ Main: credit to the waiter, he recommended we share the day's special of 300g Wagu beef with a wasabi-yogurt sauce and rocket salad (possibly as it was also \u00a378). We paired it up with the Maple-Bourbon Sweet Potatoes (which is a mash, not fries). All I can say is the beef was succulent and tender, perfectly medium-rare; but the sweet potatoes mash- my god. Nearly too sweet, but I was licking (secretly) the copper bowl it arrived it (which is straight from the hot plate, so watch out). More. I wanted more. \n+/- Dessert: Key lime pie was lovely. The hint of bitterness was exactly what was needed after the rich meal. My companion had re fudge cake; a classic, but didn't blow me away. Tastes differ I guess! \n+ Wine: Glass of Pecorino, my choice and the waiter's favourite (being Italian). \n+ Service: solid and attentive. Waiter recognised me from somewhere else and told me at then end of the night, which was nice, and didn't mind having a conversation that didn't make you feel he was being nice for the sake of tips. \n- Other: exit later in the evening is out the side entrance by the hotel, though a franky dull corridor near the hotel area, into the side street. Just... Why? Makes you feel you are being turfed out into the gutter. \nSecret suggestion: find the smoking area past the toilets with the lipstick all over it. Meet some celebs. There are other bits, but unless you are a master class blagger or engine celeb, g'luck :)"

And the french toasts - good although not outstanding according to my husband. Nice decor and personnel is very friendly. On balance is a good spot for a week-end brunch. Reservation is highly recommended to avoid long lines. We will come back to try more dishes!"

    "review": "I confess that even though I read mixed reviews of Chiltern Firehouse and didn't really have high expectations of the food, I still wanted to go in the hope of meeting Kylie (Minogue) there.  Alas it was not to be and I left sans Kylie as a new bff (her loss obvs).\nFirstly, the staff they hire are all gorgeous and friendly.  Our waiter had the most beautifully perfect set of teeth combined with a great French accent that we all couldn't help but gaze into his lovely smile.  And our Sommelier was just charming.  The wine she helped us choose was a perfect match to our food.\nThe food was a little disappointing.  I ordered the crab donuts, steak tartare, and Grilled Iberico Pork for mains.  Crab donuts were okay but surprisingly not very much crab.  Steak tartare was definitely the highlight as this was served with a deliciously spicy smoked sauce that made the raw beef sing.  Iberico pork was very disappointing.  While the pork itself was perfectly tender and tasty, the accompaniments were a green, sour, slushy mess and did nothing to enhance or compliment the pork.\nFor the price we paid, I wouldn't rush back in a hurry."

    "review": "Made a reservation about a month in advance with no problem.  Was looking forward to a great meal with family.  The decor is definitely interesting as it still houses the vestiges of its prior firehouse incarnation.  There was a young and hip vibe with the clientele and we looked forward to a relaxing dinner.   The waitstaff was attractive and efficient, but certainly not warm or inviting.  The food came quickly and looked beautiful, but it lacked deep flavor, and the fish was overcooked and dry.  We seemed to be in a high traffic area (somewhat near the bar) and while many waitstaff ran past our table, our waiter was quite scarce.  Water glasses were left unfilled, and wine was not poured as needed.  \nOverall,  that Chiltern is quite consistent.  From the moment that you arrive you will enjoy the look of the venue, the beauty of the staff, and the presentation of the food.  At the same time, the venue, staff and food lack any real depth and all seem to be going through the motions.  There are too many good food choices in London to pay top dollar at Chiltern Firehouse, only to leave feeling like something important was missing."

We were on vacation visiting my brother who works in London and he recommended we go to Chiltern Firehouse for our Thanksgiving dinner.\nWe were extremely lucky to get a reservation through a friend and it was definitely worth the ask! That night they had a Thanksgiving themed menu with the best sweet potato mash I've ever had. But the crown jewel of the night was our sommelier who went above and beyond bringing us different wines to taste, and obviously we obliged and ordered the bottles because his recommendations were impeccable.\nIf you get a chance to dine here I promise you won't be disappointed! The service and ambience was very refreshing, especially since it's such a hyped scene."

I enjoyed the appetizers the most. The beef tartar was well done, with the right balance of flavors and the right cut. The key lime pie was out of this world and so innovative, it was a shell with a creamy filling and ton of flavor. \nI love the ambiance of this place and some of London's finest agree too.

    "review": "My friend managed to snag this booking months in advance- don't ask me how it's done! London's hottest restaurant is frequented by celebrities who hail from near and far. Unfortunately on a Monday night, none of them were in sight, but the paparazzi were camped outside the entrance nonetheless. Upon arrival, I was greeted by no less than 5 members of staff before I even reached the hostess, and I was shown to my table immediately to await my friends. \nThey have a lovely cute drinks/snack menu for those who are waiting, and the starters on there are different than the proper starters you can later order with dinner. And the one thing that struck me is that Chiltern is surprisingly affordable- you can get a glass of wine for \u00a35, a bottle of wine for under \u00a325, starters for \u00a315ish, desserts for under \u00a310, and mains are in the \u00a325-30 range generally. We ordered the crab-filled doughnuts as a snack and got the Grenache blanc for wine... I don't think you can go wrong with the wine list, it's just a matter of price, and the doughnuts came highly recommended and the innovation did not disappoint.  \nAs a starter, I ordered the grilled octopus (served with aubergine, daikon, and mushrooms) with a lovely miso sauce. One of my friends ordered the sea trout crudo, which was basically sashimi served with some sort of fish roe (I am not into that, but if that is your sort of thing, you'd probably like it). For my main, I got the spring lamb, served with black garlic, goat's curd, and grilled lettuce. The goat's curd was interesting... it was like a sour cream kind of taste and texture. Unfortunately one of my friends ordered the roasted turbot and she got food poisoning later in the night, and we think that is the reason why. And for the dessert, there is a frozen panna cotta that was positively divine... you definitely have to try it! I also had the tokaji dessert wine which was the perfect finish. \nOverall, it was a great experience, but I just had to mention the food poisoning but I hope the restaurant makes amends! Other than that, the venue is surprisingly normal and there is no need for normal people to be intimidated :)"

We'd barely been sat down two minutes before they had rushed over to take our order, and the food was as quickly set onto the table in front of us.   \nHonestly, I can't fault the food - it was well presented, well cooked and tasted lovely, however I wouldn't say it was any better than some other cheaper restaurants in London. When you're paying such a high price tag, you would expect something a little more mind blowing than what we were served. The champagne cocktails were probably the highlight of the meal, while the coffee was weak and a little tasteless.   \nWould I recommend this place? Sure, if only for the experience of saying you've been and done a little celeb spotting while you were at it - but sadly I feel that's probably the best feature of the place."

I had to wangle a reservation from someone in the know for me and my friends.\nPROS:\n- You might see a celeb.\n- The bar waiting area is very nice.\n- The starters. The Venison Sausage Rolls was flavoursome and tasty. The Crab doughnuts. Now these were raved upon by many upon research and they are OK.\n- They have some lovely house wine (so much so we continued to drink another bottle after)\n- We sat at a table but the area where the chefs cook you can sit at.\n- The Garden as you enter. Sat outside after eating and enjoying over hearing conversations amongst the rich.\n- It's situated in a lovely area of Marylebone. Right opposite one of my fav places to unwind (Monocle Cafe).\nCONS:\n- The tables all feel a bit too tightly compact to one another.\n- It all feel a bit stiff. Maybe it feels like the place to be seen rather than a place to go eat well. And I really couldn't wait to dine at somewhere Nuno Mendes was head chef.\n- The eggs Benedict. Biscuit instead of muffin. I really would prefer a posh English muffin than an American dry biscuit. Disappointed to say the least.\n- The Lobster Scrambled Eggs. Was horrible in all honesty. One way of ruining an expensive ingredient with one of the most simple. Avoid.\nThe problem with places like this is that the 'buzz', 'hype' and 'reputation' sometimes proceeds itself. And for those prices and mark up it is not worth it in terms of value. Unless of course you saw David Beckham or some world star perhaps... ;)"

This new space is warm and sexy and has a sense of place -- similar to Viajante. Now that it's less of a trek to get to, it seems to be a magnet for famous people. But you should go here because it is great and lovely. The ceiling looks like it is covered with the burlap strap woven bottoms of the seats of antique chairs. \nSit at the \"chef's table\" (the bar) and watch the action at a 10+ foot long stove, custom made by some company in America. Getting that shipped out must have been quite an undertaking.\nThe cocktail list is incredible. I was waiting for my dining companion and enjoyed what I believe was called \"love in a cold place\" -- all of my favorite things in a glass. \nI'd had the Iberico pork steak at one of the Portuguese nights at Viajante, and it was great here, too. \nSadly no frozen olive oil candies, but they do give you some chocolates to finish the meal.\nGluten-free notes: Many (half or more) of the dishes on the menu are gluten-free. They know what gluten is and can help you out. Unfortunately no freshly baked cumin rolls like Viajante had."

We ate at the chef's counter because we were not able to get a reservation for a regular table and I am glad we had this experience which allowed us to watch the chefs in action.  The atmosphere is great and the service is impeccable, friendly, and unpretentious.  The food was outstanding as well.  The zucchini starter, the crab donuts, the caesar salad, the pumpkin gnocchi, and the chicken were all delicious.  These are very talented chefs, serving quality food with very fresh ingredients in an unpretentious setting.  We even purchased the cookbook and attempted to make a reservation for the next evening (unfortunately they were booked solid, but I can see why)  This isn't one of those places that makes it difficult to get a reservation to appear desirable... the food is that good and the reservation dept will do their best to accommodate you.  Next time our travels take us to London I am making sure to make at least one reservation at this restaurant.  I live in New York City and I have never had service this welcoming and accommodating at any restaurant.  When we were leaving they called a cab for us and held an umbrella over my fiance as we walked out of the building.  These small gestures all helped make a great experience."

After zigzagging through the streets for quite a while we finally found it.  Speaking to the Maitre d' we were lucky enough to secure two seats at the chef's table. We were greeted very warmly by Rafal who would be our server for the evening.  We started out with a wonderful full bodied Italian red. The first course chosen was the crab stuffed donuts which proved to be light and delicious.  The second course chosen was the pumpkin porridge-truly fantastic with hazelnuts and chestnuts on top.  Perfect balance! Growing up eating wild game my father hunted I was thrilled to find venison on the menu which was enthusiastically encouraged by Rafal. It was such a pleasure to watch the hustle of the kitchen as everyone worked fluidly to create some exquisite looking plates-every dish was tended to like a work of art! The venison(ordered medium rare) did not disappoint! Smoky, juicy and balanced out with a pecan pesto and a teriyaki-glazed chard. Every bite was beyond delectable! After asking us a few questions, Rafal suggested the frozen apple pannacotta for dessert and it couldn't have been more perfect! Rafal's charm and wit made our experience incredibly enjoyable. As the meal came to a close Rafal brought a picture perfect cappuccino that tasted as perfect as it looked. Shifting to the bar for a nice after dinner drink-a special Zacapa rum was chosen. The bartenders were equally wonderful, charming and a joy to watch as they mixed endless cocktails with precision and ease. Our experience will be talked about for a very long time! THANK YOU!"

They told us we had to be finished in 2 1/2 hours which was a pity because we would have stayed on and had desert and more drinks. I'm not a fan of restaurants that move you out, especially if you're spending big as we were. Cocktails were very nice. Starters of crab donuts and octopus were excellent but main courses were just ok. Maple sweet potato mash was the consistency of baby food and far too sweet. Could only taste maple. Sadly, all the food was totally over salted. The whole table said so. Apart from the crab donuts (which were gorgeous), octopus and maple mash everything, without exception was salty and this is coming from people who love highly-seasoned food. Still, service and atmos was good enough that we'll be back. Also, it's a shame they save the pretty courtyard as a \"sacred space\" for hotel guests.

The signature dish, 'Pork Iberico', was tough & dry and, worst of all, the 'maple sweet potato' side dish was so sweet it was inedible.\nThe whole operation appeared almost random, apparently lacking an authoritative maitre d' to ensure it flowed professionally.\nThere were several highlights, including some of the food dishes (Carrot blunts, Short rib, Octopus), but way too few to warrant the price and the reputation, especially when London has so many other great restaurants.\nThe one saving grace was our main server, who was excellent -  she was the only redemption for a venue that has built a reputation for being coolest eatery in town, yet completely lacked the attention to detail to deserve that accolade."

I wanted to thank everyone at Chiltern Firehouse for the fabulous meal and experience while we were in London.  I especially want to thank the bartender who crafted a beautiful handmade cocktail especially for my husband and delivered it to our table with a message from our sons who could not be with us.  The restaurant and bar were packed, so I truly appreciate his efforts and my husband was blown away by the whole thing. Again, thank you for the lovely atmosphere, the outstanding food, the interesting crowd and a very special thank you to the bartender!!!!"

    "review": "Sad to say that the hype may have gotten the best of this restaurant.\nThe small bites, appetizers and desserts were all fantastic. Well prepared and presented. The main courses we ok, but nothing spectacular. No real complaints, just nothing to write home about. While the restaurant has an excellent wine list, it is grotesquely overpriced. It's aimed towards those who want to be seen spending money, not those interested in drinking a great wine.\nOur main waiter was very friendly. However, there seems to be overall poor communication between the staff. We would ask for a drink or bread and the message never seemed to be passed on - disappointing for a restaurant of this calibre. Having to re-ask for things multiple times is tiresome. The sommelier also left something to be desire as far as friendliness goes.\nThe atmosphere and d\u00e9cor are lovely and comfortable. Modern European with an open kitchen.\nIf you're prepared for the fact that it's over-hyped, you'll have a good dinner."

My fish dish was flakey and moist inside and crisp on the outside. The service was perfect and I will make a reservation long before I travel to London to go back again!"

    "review": "The decor is super and our waiter was fabulous, however, when the starter came wrong and we complained the manger Jonathan arrived who had the wrong attitude. He was more keen to prove us wrong than correct the mistake. We booked a table for 5, a few weeks ago but were given a table for 4 with a seat in the passage for the 5th. Don't be excited to visit as they overbook and have arrogance.\nI think once the popularity wears out this place will be a disaster as needs to pay attention to the customer."

    "review": "The most pretentious place I have ever eaten at. You can read all the other reviews about the decor and the setting which is quite spectacular. The place is a scene to be seen and for those to see you. From the moment you arrive you are greeted by the outside bellman/bouncers? and looked up and down before you are delivered off to another chap who walks you thorough the maze to the hostess. \nPicture this, we went for breakfast on a Monday morning with four people and there was only a handful of tables occupied with about 25 staff people milling around trying to look busy. It was amazing the number of staff present for Monday morning breakfast.\nWe place our order for breakfast, with only one request, that one of the egg dishes be cooked well done. (no running yokes) Simple enough for any breakfast cook.\nWhen the dish arrived, the yoke was still runny and we asked if we could get the order done as requested. The look and attitude that we received from the waitress was \" I told them to cook it the way you wanted\". It went back to the kitchen and was recooked.\nThen I took a bite of my french toast, it was totally raw inside, with the milk and egg oozing out. I asked another waitress if the chef could finish cooking the french toast and she brought the dish back to the kitchen.\nAbout 5 minutes later our waitress delivered us the following message from the Chef. \" I will be happy to cook you another french toast, but it will come out the same way as before\" OMG Any five year old can cook french toast!  I was ready to get up and go in the kitchen and show the chef how to make the simplest of breakfast foods.\nIt just wasn't worth the effort. \nI guess the celebs like their food un cooked. This place is not worth the time nor the effort, especially when there is such a big disconnect between the kitchen, staff and guest.\nThey obviously did not recognize who we were......\nbut I hope for all you reading this, you don't support such an unwelcoming place that can't train its staff and kitchen about basic customer service, considering they have so many people on duty."

We had a meeting in the less that par conference room and we're constantly harassed by the staff after hours as to wether or not we were staying at the hotel or not. For the over all price I do not see the value"

    "review": "This place is the worst.  The crowd is old and wannabe.  Not contemporary or for the young, successful,  and attractive at ALL. The people there did not look good.\n   This place claims to be elite but probably was 2 years ago.  We had dinner there and the food was tasteless and very average.  On top of that, they said we could get to the main bar area, and after having us spend so much money on crappy food, they did not let us in to the main bar, claiming they were at \"full capacity\".  Then when trying to leave, they tried to be \"gracious\" by hailing us a taxi out of a strange back ally.  The taxi, we realized while already on the road, was cash only, and took us on a completely round about route, which cost twice as much as any taxi we had taken for the same distance.  When we confronted the taxi driver, threatening to report him,  he gave us a discount.  \n    All and all, we had a terrible and expensive experience being ripped off at the Chiltern Firehouse.  Don't believe the hype. Just don't go here."

Usually the hottest places don't deliver on either food or service, here they deliver on everything. The food was creative and fun, the service was happy and it was as buzzy as it gets."

Mind you, this is an expensive lunch, we certainly didn't linger long.  I guess his huff when we didn't order the moment he set the wine down should have been a clue."
